"Dual role of RASSF1 as a tumor suppressor and an oncogene in neuroendocrine tumors of the lung. BACKGROUND: Little is known about the dual role of RAS-association domain family 1 (RASSF1) gene at 3p21.3 in neuroendocrine tumors (NET) of the lung. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty typical carcinoids (TC), 11 atypical carcinoids (ATC), 11 large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas (LCNEC) and 16 small cell lung carcinomas (SCLC) were analyzed for RASSF1 promoter methylation, mRNA and protein expression, and loss of 3p21.3 locus. RESULTS: Promoter 1 was hypermethylated in NET but not in paired non-neoplastic lung tissues nor in 20 control NSCLC, with the degree of hypermethylation paralleling tumor grade. RASSF1 A/E isoform mRNA but not protein expression was lost in most NET compared to NSCLC or non-neoplastic tissues. The relationship between methylation level and mRNA or protein loss varied by NET type, with significant correlation for decreasing RASSF1 A protein in ACT, and marginal correlation for down-regulated RASSF 1 A/E mRNA in TC, this suggesting a non linear regulation by methylation in NET. No promoter 2 methylation was detected in NET; however, up-regulation of its RASSF1 C transcript emerged as an adverse prognostic factor in the LCNEC/SCLC group. A correlation was found between 3p21.3 allelic loss and decrease of RASSF1 A/E mRNA (p=0.023) and protein (p=0.043) expression in ATC, suggesting that 3p21.3 allelic loss contributed to the loss of gene expression. CONCLUSION: RASSF1 A/E is likely to act as a tumor suppressor gene in most pulmonary NET, and RASSF1 C as an oncogene in high-grade tumors.",cancer
"Synchronous rectal adenocarcinoma and bilateral clear cell renal carcinoma. A 69-year-old man was admitted for resection of rectal adenocarcinoma diagnosed by colonoscopy. Preoperative computed tomography scan and abdominal ultrasonography revealed bilateral renal tumors measuring up to 2 and 2.8 cm in largest diameter, respectively. The patient underwent partial colectomy and bilateral partial nephrectomy. Microscopically, rectal adenocarcinoma penetrated the submucosa, without invasion of the muscularis propria. Both renal tumors were clear cell renal carcinomas of Fuhrmann nuclear grade 2. To our knowledge, this is the first case of synchronous adenocarcinoma of the rectum and bilateral clear cell renal cell carcinoma described in the literature to date.",cancer
"Czech National Cancer Screening Programmes in 2010. BACKGROUNDS: All three cancer screening programmes recommended by the Council of the EU are available to defined target age groups in the Czech Republic. Organized programmes for screening of breast, colorectal and cervical cancer have been initiated in the last decade. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A system for information support, as an essential component of organized screening programmes, has been implemented in all screening programmes. It comprises the Czech National Cancer Registry to monitor the cancer burden and population impact of the programmes, the National Reference Centre as a provider of nationwide insurance claims data, and the specialised databases of all three programmes, which collect information on screening, diagnostics and final diagnoses. RESULTS: Early diagnostics of malignant neoplasms and progress in therapy have helped to stabilize mortality, even in diagnoses with increasing incidence. The coverage of the Czech screening programmes has constantly been rising; however, it is still insufficient: 51.2%, 17.9% and 48.4% of the target population was covered at the end of 2008 in breast, colorectal and cervical screening programmes, respectively. In 2008, a total of 468,419 women underwent screening mammography and 2,128 tumours were detected (4.5 per 1,000 screened). According to the screening colonoscopy registry, more than 13,000 men and women underwent preventive colonoscopy in 2009, 4,085 patients were diagnosed with adenoma and 619 with colorectal cancer, mostly in the early stages. The information system for cervical screening was implemented in 2009 and has been running in pilot mode; the first results are expected at the end of 2010. CONCLUSION: The system for information support within organised cancer screening programmes enables monitoring of the performance of screening and diagnostic centres and thus helps to maintain continuous quality improvements, which are a necessary presumption for replicating the promising results of clinical trials. To achieve a substantial impact on population incidence and mortality, a large increase in test coverage in target populations will be necessary. The programmes should be transformed to a population-based form, which involves inviting all people in the target population to be screened.",cancer
"Surgical management of giant pediatric craniopharyngiomas. OBJECT: Prior work by the authors' group and reports of other authors suggest worse functional outcomes and decreased survival in children with larger craniopharyngiomas. The purpose of this study was to assess the oncological, endocrinological, and functional outcomes in children who underwent radical resection of giant craniopharyngiomas (defined as 5 cm or greater in largest diameter). METHODS: Between 1986 and 2006, 26 children under the age of 18 (14 boys, 12 girls; mean age 10.5 years) underwent radical resection of giant craniopharyngiomas performed by the senior author. Data were retrospectively collected to assess the outcome of surgical treatment. RESULTS: Twenty (77%) of 26 patients underwent gross-total resection (GTR) confirmed by intraoperative inspection and postoperative imaging. All primary tumors (17 of 17) and 3 (33%) of 9 recurrent tumors were treated with GTR. There was no operative mortality, and 18 of 26 patients (69%) were alive at a mean follow-up of 8.9 years (median 9.3 years). Disease control was achieved in 21 (84%) of the 25 patients followed up for more than 6 months and was more successful in patients who underwent GTR (95%) than in those who underwent STR (50%, p = 0.03). New-onset diabetes insipidus (DI) occurred in 63.2% of patients (73% of patients had DI postoperatively). New or worsened deficits in visual acuity and visual fields occurred in 16% and 28%, respectively, of the 25 patients for whom postoperative visual data were available. Five patients (19%) experienced significant, permanent neurological deficits, and 5 (19%) had mild to moderate deficits. New or worsened hypothalamic disturbance occurred in 35% and 22% of patients, respectively, but obesity developed in only 15%. CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective series, radical resection of giant craniopharyngiomas in children was found to lead to excellent rates of disease control with acceptable or good functional outcomes but slightly higher rates of neurological complications compared with rates in patients with smaller tumors. Radical resection is less successful in recurrent tumors that reach very large sizes, especially previously irradiated tumors, with resultant diminished survival.",cancer
"The effectiveness of transverse coloplasty in patients with ultra-lower rectal cancer. Rectal cancer accounts for 40% of colon cancer, and postoperative defecatory function is considered to markedly affect the patients' quality of life. We performed transverse coloplasty in 33 patients with rectal cancer who had undergone an anal function preservation operation in which the anastomotic site was within 1 cm of the dentate line (ultra-low anterior resection) and evaluated its effectiveness in controlling the patients' defecatory function. The average daily defecation frequency 1, 6, and 12 months postoperatively was 7.8, 5, and 3.6 times daily following straight colorectal reconstruction (the anastomotic site was more than 5 cm from the dentate line) and 7.5, 3.5, and 2.4 times daily following transverse coloplasty, respectively. Concerning postoperative complications, anastomotic leakage, soiling, and constipation were observed in 1, 1, and 1 cases, respectively. Transverse coloplasty can be performed in a short time, and it is considered a safe and useful method to manage defecatory",cancer

"Predicting hematologic toxicity in patients undergoing radioimmunotherapy with 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan or 131I-tositumomab. This study aimed at identifying clinical factors for predicting hematologic toxicity after radioimmunotherapy with (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan or (131)I-tositumomab in clinical practice. METHODS: Hematologic data were available from 14 non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients treated with (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan and 18 who received (131)I-tositumomab. The percentage baseline at nadir and 4 wk post nadir and the time to nadir were selected as the toxicity indicators for both platelets and neutrophils. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify significant predictors (P < 0.05) of each indicator. RESULTS: For both platelets and neutrophils, pooled and separate analyses of (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan and (131)I-tositumomab data yielded the time elapsed since the last chemotherapy as the only significant predictor of the percentage baseline at nadir. The extent of bone marrow involvement was not a significant factor in this study, possibly because of the short time elapsed since the last chemotherapy of the 7 patients with bone marrow involvement. Because both treatments were designed to deliver a comparable bone marrow dose, this factor also was not significant. None of the 14 factors considered was predictive of the time to nadir. The R(2) value for the model predicting percentage baseline at nadir was 0.60 for platelets and 0.40 for neutrophils. This model predicted the platelet and neutrophil toxicity grade to within +/-1 for 28 and 30 of the 32 patients, respectively. For the 7 patients predicted with grade I thrombocytopenia, 6 of whom had actual grade I-II, dosing might be increased to improve treatment efficacy. CONCLUSION: The elapsed time since the last chemotherapy can be used to predict hematologic toxicity and customize the current dosing method in radioimmunotherapy.",cancer

This article, the sixth in a series on pain, aims to provide nurses with information about neuropathic pain, its causes, clinical presentation and treatment approaches, to assist in the management of patients with this condition. Neuropathic pain is a significant clinical problem. As a chronic condition it can cause distress and disability. It is important that symptoms are recognised promptly and appropriate treatments offered in a timely fashion to help reduce the burden of neuropathic pain and improve patients' quality of life. Nurses can play an important role in this process as they are often involved in pain assessment and can help to identify patients who may require neuropathic pain interventions.",nocancer
"Continuous positive airway pressure as treatment for systemic hypertension in people with obstructive sleep apnoea: randomised controlled trial. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring values in a large number of patients with untreated systemic hypertension of new onset and obstructive sleep apnoea. DESIGN: Multicentre, double blind, randomised, placebo controlled trial. SETTING: Eleven general hospitals in Spain between 2004 and 2007. PARTICIPANTS: 340 patients recently diagnosed as having systemic hypertension by a general practitioner (systolic blood pressure >/=140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure >/=90 mm Hg, or both) and an apnoea-hypopnoea index per hour of sleep of >15 events/hour. INTERVENTION: Patients were assigned to CPAP (n=169) or sham CPAP (n=171) for three months. Main outcome measurements Net changes in the different 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring values from baseline to three months of optimal or sham CPAP. RESULTS: 277 (81%) of the 340 patients randomised were men; the patients had a mean age of 52.4 (SD 10.5) years, a body mass index of 31.9 (5.7), an Epworth sleepiness scale score of 10.1 (4.3), an apnoea-hypopnoea index of 43.5 (24.5). No differences between groups were seen at baseline. Compared with placebo and analysed by intention to treat, the mean 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure of the CPAP group decreased by 1.5 (95% confidence interval: 0.4 to 2.7) mm Hg (P=0.01). The mean 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring measures decreased by 2.1 mm Hg (0.4 to 3.7) mm Hg (P=0.01) for systolic pressure and 1.3 (0.2 to 2.3) mm Hg (P=0.02) for diastolic blood pressure. Mean nocturnal blood pressure decreased by 2.1 (0.5 to 3.6) mm Hg (P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: CPAP produced a statistically significant reduction in blood pressure in patients with systemic hypertension and obstructive sleep apnoea. This reduction is small and did not achieve the 3 mm Hg drop in mean 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure that the trial was powered to detect. Consequently, these results may have uncertain clinical relevance. However, taking into account the prevalence of hypertension and the likelihood of comorbidities, the decrease in blood pressure, although minimal, may be beneficial.

"'Young' oral fibroblasts are geno/phenotypically distinct. Wound healing within the oral mucosa results in minimal scar formation compared with wounds within the skin. We have recently demonstrated distinct differences in the aging profiles of cells (oral mucosal and patient-matched skin fibroblasts) isolated from these tissues. We hypothesized that the increased replicative potential of oral mucosal fibroblasts may confer upon them preferential wound-healing capacities. Passage-matched early cultures of oral mucosal fibroblasts and skin fibroblasts demonstrated distinct gene expression profiles, with several genes linked to wound healing/tissue repair. This was related to an increased ability of the 'replicatively younger' oral mucosal fibroblasts to repopulate a wound space and reorganize their surrounding extracellular matrix environment, key activities during the wound-healing process. We conclude that oral mucosal fibroblasts exhibit a preferential healing response in vivo, due to their 'replicatively younger' phenotype when compared with that of patient-matched skin fibroblasts.",nocancer
"Functional changes in the aging kidney. The aging process results in remarkable changes in the kidney. These changes are both anatomical and functional and have been considered the cause of the increased propensity of the elderly to acute or chronic renal failure. However, the majority of the early studies on aging enrolled institutionalized elderly patients with several comorbidities such as hypertension and heart disease which could by themselves induce renal alterations. Recently the selection of subjects lacking renal disease or processes known to affect renal function has demonstrated that aging changes are less pronounced in healthy aged subjects. Nonetheless, understanding aging-induced renal changes may help to prevent life-threatening kidney disease. This review will focus on glomerular hemodynamics, and on renal sodium and potassium handling and diluting and concentrating ability.",nocancer

"Easier said than done: behavioral conflicts in following social-distancing recommendations for influenza prevention. Preventing transmission of H1N1 and other infectious diseases can require individuals to change behaviors, but recommendations to change behavior can run counter to other powerful influences. For example, instructions to not shake hands or avoid certain public gatherings can run counter to substantial social pressures to shake hands or be in attendance. These behavioral conflicts are illustrated with an experience of the relative ineffectiveness of voluntary recommendations, which highlights the importance of considering these social pressures when determining what recommendations to make and how to make them. An analysis of how social pressures influence behaviors relevant to preventing disease transmission can aid public health officials in considering how to make effective recommendations concerning H1N1 and other infectious disease situations.",nocancer
"Recognizing and diagnosing fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia affects an estimated 2% of the American population. Current understanding explains it as a neurologic disorder of central pain processing that causes the perception of pain in response to stimuli that in healthy individuals would not be painful. The recognition of fibromyalgia can lead to effective treatment with significant improvement in functioning. Unfortunately, because of the chronic nature of the pain condition and associated counterproductive behaviors and disability, patients and physicians may rapidly become frustrated with each other and abandon the pursuit of adequate diagnosis and treatment. If the physician instead recognizes the diagnostic pattern of pain and appreciates the real nature of the underlying pathology, then he or she can be of great benefit to patients and their families in managing this chronic disease.",nocancer

"Cytologic diagnosis of hepatobiliary cystadenoma with mesenchymal stroma during intraoperative consultation: a case report. BACKGROUND: Hepatobiliary cystadenoma with mesenchymal stroma (HCMS) is a rare cystic tumor characterized by a layer of mucinous cuboidal to columnar epithelium situated on top of a basement membrane resting on an ovarian-like stroma. Cytologic features of this entity have not been extensively studied. We present a case of HCMS with emphasis on cytologic material obtained at the time of intraoperative consultation (IOC). CASE: A 51-year-old woman had partial resection of a liver cyst. Seven months later she sought further medical attention and presented for surgical reevaluation and reexcision of the same lesion. Initial computed tomography revealed a multiloculated liver cyst. Five months after reexcision the lesion recurred and was again excised. During IOC, scrape cytology revealed both biliary epithelial and mesenchymal stromal cells in a cystic background. Permanent sections showed histologic features of HCMS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first cytologic description of such a neoplasm to include both epithelial and mesenchymal stromal elements. CONCLUSION: The use of scrape cytology during IOC can be a fast and effective way of identifying both the epithelium and mesenchymal stroma when HCMS is in the differential diagnosis of a cystic liver lesion.",cancer
"Pancreatic pseudocyst-inferior vena cava fistula causing caval stenosis, left renal vein thrombosis, subcutaneous fat necrosis, arthritis and dysfibrinogenemia. AIM: We describe the case of a 38 year old man, with a story of alcohol abuse, who developed a very painful nodular subcutaneous fat necrosis, fever and polyarthritis, denying any abdominal symptoms due to a pancreatic pseudocyst-inferior vena cava fistula. MATERIAL OF STUDY: The authors discuss the unusual and protracted course with intermittent hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia related to clinical manifestations such as subcutaneous fat necrosis, polyarthritis, pleural effusion and dysfibrinogenemia, and vascular complications as inferior vena cava stenosis and left renal vein thrombosis without abdominal symptomatology. RESULTS: After ultrasonograms and CT Scans showing a 3-4 cm cyst at the pancreatic head with a solid bud protruding into the pseudocystic cavity, and an ERCP showing a communication between the pancreatic duct and the pseudocyst but failing in demonstrating the vascular fistula, the patient underwent a Roux-en-y pseudocyst-jejunostomy and suture of the caval communication leading to complete recovery with normalization of laboratory findings. DISCUSSION: In our case, the locally sclerosing activity of the enzymes in the endothelium led to a communication between the inferior vena cava and the pseudocyst and to a complete thrombosis of the left renal vein and to a stenosis of the inferior vena cava itself The fluctuance of the symptomatology severity was probably due to an intermittent opening of the passage between pseudocyst and vena cava. Such a clinical case, to the author knowledge, has never been reported. CONCLUSION: When in presence of very high levels of amylasemia and lipasemia in spite of the paucity of abdominal symptomatology, and the onset of unusual complications such as panniculitis, pleural effusion, arthritis and coagulative disorders, a pancreatic pseudocyst-inferior vena cava fistula should be kept in consideration during diagnosis.",cancer
"Multispectral real-time fluorescence imaging for intraoperative detection of the sentinel lymph node in gynecologic oncology. The prognosis in virtually all solid tumors depends on the presence or absence of lymph node metastases. Surgical treatment most often combines radical excision of the tumor with a full lymphadenectomy in the drainage area of the tumor. However, removal of lymph nodes is associated with increased morbidity due to infection, wound breakdown and lymphedema. As an alternative, the sentinel lymph node procedure (SLN) was developed several decades ago to detect the first draining lymph node from the tumor. In case of lymphogenic dissemination, the SLN is the first lymph node that is affected (Figure 1). Hence, if the SLN does not contain metastases, downstream lymph nodes will also be free from tumor metastases and need not to be removed. The SLN procedure is part of the treatment for many tumor types, like breast cancer and melanoma, but also for cancer of the vulva and cervix. The current standard methodology for SLN-detection is by peritumoral injection of radiocolloid one day prior to surgery, and a colored dye intraoperatively. Disadvantages of the procedure in cervical and vulvar cancer are multiple injections in the genital area, leading to increased psychological distress for the patient, and the use of radioactive colloid. Multispectral fluorescence imaging is an emerging imaging modality that can be applied intraoperatively without the need for injection of radiocolloid. For intraoperative fluorescence imaging, two components are needed: a fluorescent agent and a quantitative optical system for intraoperative imaging. As a fluorophore we have used indocyanine green (ICG). ICG has been used for many decades to assess cardiac function, cerebral perfusion and liver perfusion. It is an inert drug with a safe pharmaco-biological profile. When excited at around 750 nm, it emits light in the near-infrared spectrum around 800 nm. A custom-made multispectral fluorescence imaging camera system was used. The aim of this video article is to demonstrate the detection of the SLN using intraoperative fluorescence imaging in patients with cervical and vulvar cancer. Fluorescence imaging is used in conjunction with the standard procedure, consisting of radiocolloid and a blue dye. In the future, intraoperative fluorescence imaging might replace the current method and is also easily transferable to other indications like breast cancer and melanoma.",cancer

"A support vector machine (SVM) for predicting preferred treatment position in radiotherapy of patients with breast cancer. PURPOSE: NYU 05-181 protocol compared the CT simulation in both supine and prone positions for 400 patients with breast cancer (200 left-breast and 200 right-breast) to identify which setup is better at sparing heart and lung involvement in the treatment process. The results demonstrated that all right-breast patients benefited from the prone treatment position, while for left-breast patients, 85% were better treated prone and 15% were better treated supine. Using the clinical data collected from this protocol, the authors aimed at developing an automated tool capable of identifying which of the left-breast cancer patients are better treated supine without obtaining a second CT scan in the supine position. METHODS: Prone CT scans from 198 of the 200 left-breast cancer patients enrolled in NYU 05-181 protocol were deidentified and exported to a dedicated research planning workstation. Three-dimensional geometric features of the organs at risk and tumor bed were extracted. A two-stage classifier was used to classify patients into the prone class or the supine class. In the first stage, the authors use simple thresholding to divide the patients into two groups based on their in-field heart volume. For patients with in-field heart volume < or = 0.1 cc, the prone position was chosen as the preferred treatment position. Patients with in-field heart volume > 0.1 cc will be further classified in the second stage by a weighted support vector machine (SVM). The weight parameters of the SVM were adjusted to maximize the specificity [true-supine/(true-supine+false-prone)] at the cost of lowering but still maintaining reasonable sensitivity [true-prone/(true-prone+false-supine)]. The authors used K-fold cross validations to test the performance of the SVM classifier. A feature selection algorithm was also used to identify features that give the best classification performance. RESULTS: After the first stage, 49 of the 198 left-breast cancer patients were found to have > 0.1 cc of in-field heart volume. The three geometric features of heart orientation, distance between heart and tumor, and in-field lung were selected by the feature selection algorithm in the second stage of the two-stage classifier to give the best predefined weighted accuracy. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the proposed method were found to be 90.4% and 99.3%, respectively. Using two-stage classification, the authors reduced the proportion of prone-treated patients that need a second supine CT scan down to 16.3/170 or 9.6%, as compared to 21/170 or 12.4% when the authors use only the first stage (thresholding) for classification. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' study showed that a feature-based classifier is feasible for predicting the preferred treatment position, based on features extracted from prone CT scans. The two-stage classifier achieved very high specificity at an acceptable expense of sensitivity.",cancer
"Screening of natural products for therapeutic activity against solid tumors. Most of the currently used cancer therapeutics are natural products. These agents were generally discovered based on their toxicity to tumour cells using various bioassays. Although the exact mechanisms of action of the most commonly used cancer therapeutics such as anthracyclins, podophyllotoxins and camptothecin are incompletely understood, it is becoming increasingly clear that these agents often show complex modes of action at the cellular level, interacting with numerous targets. Such complex modes of action may be the very reason for clinical efficacy. For discovering new cytotoxic anticancer drugs sophisticated screening methods were used. The principles of such screening projects conducted, using collections of purified natural products or extracts from plants have been described. By performing simple but robust prescreening tests such as the brine shrimp assay, bioactive extracts can be identified. Extracts (65) prepared from a collection of Egyptian plants were identified that showed cytotoxity on HepG2 cells. Interestingly, 22 (33%) of these raw extracts, induced > 2-fold induction of caspase-cleavage activity in a colon carcinoma cell line, consistent with induction of apoptosis. Only a fraction of the diversity of the biosphere has been tested for biological activity and novel cancer therapeutics remains to be discovered.",cancer
"Chromatin-bound PCNA as S-phase marker in mononuclear blood cells of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or multiple myeloma. OBJECTIVES: Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) has often been used as a marker to aid assessment of tumour growth fraction. This paper addresses the question of whether it can be used as an S-phase marker, when the non-chromatin-bound form of the protein is removed by pepsin treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cytofluorometric measurements were carried out after immunofluorescence staining of PCNA and counterstaining of DNA. S-phase fraction was determined with the help of windows on PCNA versus DNA scattergrams, or mathematically from DNA histograms. RESULTS: S-phase fractions obtained using the two methods correlated well, but did not always agree, exact discrepancies depending on the mathematical model used for histogram analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Determination of S-phase fractions with the help of PCNA immunofluorescence staining is possible, and probably more reliable than calculation of S-fractions from DNA histograms. It thus offers an alternative to assays involving BrdU labelling in vivo.",cancer

"China's oral care system in transition: lessons to be learned from Germany. AIM: The objective of this discussion paper is to investigate whether the experience gained through the German paradigm shift in dental care can be of benefit in China's deliberations on the introduction of universal dental care for its people. METHODOLOGY A comparison of representative oral health outcome data from China and Germany, two countries at different stages in their development, is presented here in order to analyse whether the findings meet expected outcome and confirm the presumption that more developed countries perform better. RESULTS: The epidemiological comparison reveals surprising findings concerning the severity of dental diseases and, in particular, missing teeth per person in adults and rates of total edentulousness in seniors. In all of these areas German adults and seniors show significantly inferior outcomes compared with the Chinese population. The main reason for these striking discrepancies, as it turned out, is the decisive role played by the treatment philosophies and strategies of German dentists. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: If dentists take a less interventionist approach, checking as well as treating dental diseases with preventive and strictly tooth-preserving methods, dental treatment results in oral health. Under these conditions it can be assumed that modern dentistry is generally good for the teeth. These findings are important for developing countries that are seeking to integrate dental care into their health care system. On the basis of long-term experience from highly industrialized Western countries and especially from Germany we will attempt to put forward proposals for creating an effective and efficient dental care system in China.",nocancer
"Prognostic impact of microsatellite instability in colorectal cancer patients treated with adjuvant FOLFOX. BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) patients whose tumours have microsatellite instability (MSI) do not benefit from adjuvant 5-fluorouracil. However, the predictive value of MSI is not known for FOLFOX, now recommended in adjuvant setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: MSI phenotype was assessed by the pentaplex method. Three-year relapse and disease-free survival (DFS) of patients treated for CRC with FOLFOX 4 in an adjuvant setting were compared according to MSI phenotype. RESULTS: A total of 105 patients (19 MSI, 86 microsatellite stable, MSS) were included. Stage II patients more frequently exhibited MSI (58%) than MSS (21%); (p=0.002). Patients with MSI relapsed significantly less than those with MSS (10.5% vs. 35.0%; p=0.04). DFS was similar for MSI and MSS (p=0.1). In univariate analysis, stage (p=0.0006) and MSI status (p=0.017) were significant predictors of DFS. CONCLUSION: MSI status was associated with significantly fewer relapses and a better prognosis. FOLFOX4 did not alter survival of patients with MSI and can be administered to them.",cancer
"The association between obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and microvascular complications in well-controlled diabetic patients. BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) may promote hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. OBJECTIVE: We studied the link between sleep apnea and microvascular diabetic complications in veterans with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM-2). DESIGN: A retrospective electronic chart of all veterans referred for sleep studies over a 1-year period was reviewed. Ninety-eight patients with a glycosylated hemoglobin < 6.5% were included in the study. The degree of glycemia (HbA1c) and presence of macro- and microvascular complications were compared with OSAS variables. METHOD: Statistical analysis examined bivariate associations between OSAS variables and metabolic syndrome parameters. RESULTS: The apnea hypopnea index was significantly related to diabetic microvascular complications, particularly retinopathy. Oxygen desaturation was significantly and inversely related to microalbuminuria, microvascular complications, retinopathy, and HbA1c. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep apnea is associated with microvascular complications even in well-controlled DM-2 veterans. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Screening for OSAS should be considered in patients with DM-2.",nocancer
"Fine needle aspiration of metastatic adult granulosa cell tumor of the ovary: a case report. BACKGROUND: Granulosa cell tumors (GCTs) of the ovary are low grade ovarian malignancies with a predilection for late recurrences in the pelvic cavity and occasionally distant metastases. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) can be used to detect such recurrences accurately based on unique cytologic and immunohistochemical features. CASE: A 5-cm, retrocaval mass at the level of the kidneys was detected in a 63-year-old woman who had a diagnosis of adult GCT (AGCT) of the ovary 18 years earlier and a local recurrence 5 years prior to this admission. The FNA of the retrocaval mass displayed small tumor cells with scant cytoplasm arranged in small aggregates and isolated cells. Coffee bean-like longitudinal nuclear grooves and microfollicular structures with amorphous material resembling Call-Exner bodies were not readily identified. Cytohistologic correlation with the patient's previous biopsies and positive immunohistochemical staining reaction with estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and inhibin confirmed the recurrence of AGCT, thus avoiding unnecessary surgical interventions for diagnostic purposes. CONCLUSION: For accurate interpretation of cytologic findings of recurrent GCT, proper clinical history, cytohistologic correlation with prior biopsies and a positive immunohistochemical reaction with inhibin are of vital importance.",cancer
"Mediastinal teratoma mimicking massive pleural effusion. Immature mediastinal teratoma is very rare, found in only 1% of all mediastinal teratomas. Raised serum alpha feto-protein acts as important surrogate marker for both diagnosis and follow up in such cases. Surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy are keys in the management, especially in patients older than 15 years of age. We present a 14-year-boy presenting clinico-radiologically as left sided massive pleural effusion. Raised serum marker as well as excision biopsy of the mediastinal mass following thoracotomy were indicative of a diagnosis of immature teratoma.",cancer
"Frequent mutation of BAP1 in metastasizing uveal melanomas. Metastasis is a defining feature of malignant tumors and is the most common cause of cancer-related death, yet the genetics of metastasis are poorly understood. We used exome capture coupled with massively parallel sequencing to search for metastasis-related mutations in highly metastatic uveal melanomas of the eye. Inactivating somatic mutations were identified in the gene encoding BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) on chromosome 3p21.1 in 26 of 31 (84%) metastasizing tumors, including 15 mutations causing premature protein termination and 5 affecting its ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase domain. One tumor harbored a frameshift mutation that was germline in origin, thus representing a susceptibility allele. These findings implicate loss of BAP1 in uveal melanoma metastasis and suggest that the BAP1 pathway may be a valuable therapeutic target.",cancer
"Mitochondrial dysfunction in autism. CONTEXT: Impaired mitochondrial function may influence processes highly dependent on energy, such as neurodevelopment, and contribute to autism. No studies have evaluated mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) abnormalities in a well-defined population of children with autism. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate mitochondrial defects in children with autism. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Observational study using data collected from patients aged 2 to 5 years who were a subset of children participating in the Childhood Autism Risk From Genes and Environment study in California, which is a population-based, case-control investigation with confirmed autism cases and age-matched, genetically unrelated, typically developing controls, that was launched in 2003 and is still ongoing. Mitochondrial dysfunction and mtDNA abnormalities were evaluated in lymphocytes from 10 children with autism and 10 controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Oxidative phosphorylation capacity, mtDNA copy number and deletions, mitochondrial rate of hydrogen peroxide production, and plasma lactate and pyruvate. RESULTS: The reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) oxidase activity (normalized to citrate synthase activity) in lymphocytic mitochondria from children with autism was significantly lower compared with controls (mean, 4.4 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 2.8-6.0] vs 12 [95% CI, 8-16], respectively; P = .001). The majority of children with autism (6 of 10) had complex I activity below control range values. Higher plasma pyruvate levels were found in children with autism compared with controls (0.23 mM [95% CI, 0.15-0.31 mM] vs 0.08 mM [95% CI, 0.04-0.12 mM], respectively; P = .02). Eight of 10 cases had higher pyruvate levels but only 2 cases had higher lactate levels compared with controls. These results were consistent with the lower pyruvate dehydrogenase activity observed in children with autism compared with controls (1.0 [95% CI, 0.6-1.4] nmol x [min x mg protein](-1) vs 2.3 [95% CI, 1.7-2.9] nmol x [min x mg protein](-1), respectively; P = .01). Children with autism had higher mitochondrial rates of hydrogen peroxide production compared with controls (0.34 [95% CI, 0.26-0.42] nmol x [min x mg of protein](-1) vs 0.16 [95% CI, 0.12-0.20] nmol x [min x mg protein](-1) by complex III; P = .02). Mitochondrial DNA overreplication was found in 5 cases (mean ratio of mtDNA to nuclear DNA: 239 [95% CI, 217-239] vs 179 [95% CI, 165-193] in controls; P = 10(-4)). Deletions at the segment of cytochrome b were observed in 2 cases (ratio of cytochrome b to ND1: 0.80 [95% CI, 0.68-0.92] vs 0.99 [95% CI, 0.93-1.05] for controls; P = .01). CONCLUSION: In this exploratory study, children with autism were more likely to have mitochondrial dysfunction, mtDNA overreplication, and mtDNA deletions than typically developing children.",nocancer
"Explaining the principles of health visiting in Brazil. Brazil is a rapidly developing country. Modern health services operate in a situation of extreme social change, which resembles some of the conditions that gave rise to health visiting in 19th century Britain. A visit there revealed much interest in the health visiting principles of the search for health needs, the stimulation of an awareness of health needs, the influence on policies affecting health and the facilitation of health-enhancing activities. Explaining these principles to an audience on the other side of the world highlighted three underlying themes. The principles of health visiting are about health promotion, not assistance; they provide an integrated framework, not a list of competences or skills; and they are all underpinned by a particular value and view of health. The explana-tion was met with great interest. We need to be both more aware and better able to explain these underlying themes in this country as well.",nocancer
"Incretins: clinical perspectives, relevance, and applications for the primary care physician in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is increasing substantially in the United States. Almost 24 million people have the disease, with most of these patients treated by primary care physicians. Optimal treatment of type 2 DM requires physicians to understand the pathophysiology of this disorder. Once the physiologic defects are determined, lifestyle interventions and glucose lowering medications can be prescribed to minimize the state of chronic hyperglycemia and to address the pathophysiologic defects associated with type 2 DM. Other metabolic abnormalities, including hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and oxidative stress, must also be addressed to reduce the patient's risk of cardiovascular disease. The incretin system plays a role in the pathogenesis of type 2 DM. Incretin-based therapies, including glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors, have shown efficacy and safety in treating type 2 DM and have been reviewed in consensus treatment algorithms. This article provides an overview of the role of incretin-based therapies in the management of patients with type 2 DM and how primary care physicians can incorporate these agents into their practice.",nocancer
"Clinical experiences with anti-CD137 and anti-PD1 therapeutic antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) provide a pharmacological platform to block or activate the function of surface receptors. The immune system has evolved receptor-ligand pairs that repress or empower the cellular immune response, which, if tampered with, unleash more potent cellular immunity against tumor antigens. Agonist antibodies directed against CD137 (4-1BB) on the surface of antigen-primed T lymphocytes increase tumor immunity that is curative against some transplantable murine tumors. A fully human IgG4 anti-CD137 antibody is under development with signs of clinical activity and cases of severe liver toxicity that seem to be on-target and dose-dependent effects. Programmed death-1 (PD1) is a surface molecule delivering inhibitory signals important to maintain T-cell functional silence against their cognate antigens. Interference with PD1 or its ligand PD-L1 (B7-H1) increases antitumor immunity. As a result anti-PD1 and anti-PD-L1 human mAbs are under clinical development. Phase I trials with anti-PD1 mAb have yielded encouraging results with durable objective responses and a reasonable safety profile. As new class of drugs in cancer therapy, immunostimulatory mAbs have resulted in redefinition of tumor response criteria and rethinking of the rationale for combining these among each other and with other strategies.",cancer
"Distinctive DNA methylation patterns of cell-free plasma DNA in women with malignant ovarian tumors. OBJECTIVE: Epithelial ovarian carcinoma (OvCa) is rarely detected early, and it is also difficult to determine whether an adnexal mass is benign or malignant. Previously, we noted differences in methylation patterns of cell-free plasma DNA (cfpDNA) in women without disease compared to patients with OvCa. In this work, we investigated whether methylation patterns of cfpDNA can differentiate between benign and malignant tumors. METHODS: Methylation patterns in cfpDNA were determined in three cohorts (30 samples each) using a microarray-based assay (MethDet 56). Principal component analysis, supervised clustering, linear discrimination analysis, and 25 rounds of 5-fold cross-validation were used to determine informative genes and assess the sensitivity and specificity of differentiating between OvCa vs. healthy control (HC), benign ovarian disease (mostly serous cystadenoma, BOD) vs. HC, and OvCa vs. BOD samples. RESULTS: Differential methylation of three promoters (RASSF1A, CALCA, and EP300) differentiated between OvCa vs. HC with a sensitivity of 90.0% and a specificity of 86.7%. Three different promoters (BRCA1, CALCA, and CDKN1C) were informative for differentiating between BOD vs. HC, with a sensitivity of 90.0% and a specificity of 76.7%. Finally, two promoters (RASSF1A and PGR-PROX) were informative for differentiating between OvCa vs. BOD, with a sensitivity of 80.0% and a specificity of 73.3%. CONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-principle data show that differential methylation of promoters in cfpDNA may be a useful biomarker to differentiate between certain benign and malignant ovarian tumors.",cancer
"Therapeutic choices for curing dysodia?...three clinical cases. These three clinical cases provide an approach to the management of anatomical voice disorders. When confronted with a laryngeal diagnosis, talented musicians often suffer a crisis of self-confidence which may propel them toward maladaptive compensations; these may destabilize their usual techniques, already disrupted by the changes in their vocal acoustics. In their forties, each of these patients presents with an angiomatous lesion of the vocal fold, associated in two of the cases with a congenital structural weakness. For the three of them, the recommended therapeutic choice was alternating recorded laryngoscopic follow-up, alternative medicine prescriptions, and ""artistic sessions"" that required that their phoniatrician adapt to their repertory, their temperament, the constraints of the stage and their laryngeal disorder in order that they achieve a compromise between the needs of their career and the laryngeal anatomic realities of the moment.

"A case of signet-ring cell carcinoma of the gallbladder: immunohistochemistry and differential diagnosis. The morphological spectrum of gallbladder carcinoma is broad and variable. Most of these tumors are tubular adenocarcinomas. There are some tumors with unusual morphology that may be difficult to classify due to their rarity. One of such tumors is the signet-ring cell carcinoma, which is a highly aggressive, mucin producing variant of gallbladder adenocarcinoma predominantly or exclusively composed of signet-ring cells. Histologically, these tumors are similar to their counterparts in other organs such as stomach, colon and breast, and should not be misinterpreted as metastatic carcinoma from one of these primary sites. The literature about this variant of carcinoma is sparse and little is known about it. We found only three cases of signet-ring cell carcinoma of the gallbladder previously reported. We present the case of an 86-year-old woman with signet-ring cell carcinoma of the gallbladder and discuss the potential diagnostic dilemmas",cancer
"Update on distance and velocity requirements for community ambulation. PURPOSE: The purposes of this study were to provide an update to the ambulatory distance requirements for community ambulation and to update gait speed performance and requirements at intersections. METHODS: Distances were measured at 9 types of sites using a rolling measuring device in accordance with the protocol set forth by Lerner-Frankiel and associates. The 9 types of sites were supermarkets, drug stores, banks, department stores, post offices, medical offices, superstores, club warehouses, and hardware stores. Gait speed allotted by crosswalk signals as well as the gait speeds of individuals through crosswalks were recorded. Qualitative observations of the pedestrians' age (older - 65 years; younger < 65 years) and sex were also noted. RESULTS: Distances were measured at 141 different establishments. The shortest mean distance requirement was found in the medical offices at 65.82 (32.28) m. Club warehouses had the longest mean distance requirement at 676.82 (159.36) m. The mean gait speed used by the pedestrians (N = 139) was 1.32 (0.31) m/s while the mean speed necessary as set by the crosswalk signals was 0.49 (0.20) m/s. All of the individuals observed were able to cross the street within the allotted time and with adequate speed. The gait speeds met the normative data established for age and sex as well as data reported for slower older adults and some with incomplete spinal cord injury. CONCLUSIONS: Distance requirements for full community ambulation may need to be increased to 600 m or more. Gait speed requirements at crosswalks in the communities measured are set to accommodate the gait speed capabilities of older pedestrians who attempt crossing at controlled intersections.",nocancer
"Integrating tobacco cessation into mental health care for posttraumatic stress disorder: a randomized controlled trial. CONTEXT: Most smokers with mental illness do not receive tobacco cessation treatment. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether integrating smoking cessation treatment into mental health care for veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) improves long-term smoking abstinence rates. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A randomized controlled trial of 943 smokers with military-related PTSD who were recruited from outpatient PTSD clinics at 10 Veterans Affairs medical centers and followed up for 18 to 48 months between November 2004 and July 2009. INTERVENTION: Smoking cessation treatment integrated within mental health care for PTSD delivered by mental health clinicians (integrated care [IC]) vs referral to Veterans Affairs smoking cessation clinics (SCC). Patients received smoking cessation treatment within 3 months of study enrollment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Smoking outcomes included 12-month bioverified prolonged abstinence (primary outcome) and 7- and 30-day point prevalence abstinence assessed at 3-month intervals. Amount of smoking cessation medications and counseling sessions delivered were tested as mediators of outcome. Posttraumatic stress disorder and depression were repeatedly assessed using the PTSD Checklist and Patient Health Questionnaire 9, respectively, to determine if IC participation or quitting smoking worsened psychiatric status. RESULTS: Integrated care was better than SCC on prolonged abstinence (8.9% vs 4.5%; adjusted odds ratio, 2.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.30-3.91; P = .004). Differences between IC vs SCC were largest at 6 months for 7-day point prevalence abstinence (78/472 [16.5%] vs 34/471 [7.2%], P < .001) and remained significant at 18 months (86/472 [18.2%] vs 51/471 [10.8%], P < .001). Number of counseling sessions received and days of cessation medication used explained 39.1% of the treatment effect. Between baseline and 18 months, psychiatric status did not differ between treatment conditions. Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms for quitters and nonquitters improved. Nonquitters worsened slightly on the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 relative to quitters (differences ranged between 0.4 and 2.1, P = .03), whose scores did not change over time. CONCLUSION: Among smokers with military-related PTSD, integrating smoking cessation treatment into mental health care compared with referral to specialized cessation treatment resulted in greater prolonged abstinence.

"A novel de novo SCN1A missense mutation in Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy Borderland. In this report we describe a novel missense SCN1A mutation in a patient affected by Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy Borderland (SMEB). This three and a half year-old female patient experienced prolonged febrile seizures at the age of 14 months, followed by generalized tonic-clonic seizures, atonic seizures, atypical absences almost in a cluster and triggered by fever. Cognitive and motor development was normal. The case was suggestive for SMEB. SCN1A analysis revealed an unknown de novo point mutation: a heterozygous replacement of nucleotide G with nucleotide T in position 4183 of the coding region of the gene (c.4183 G>T) in exon 21. This mutation causes the replacement of aspartic acid with tyrosine in 1395 (p.D1396Y). Even if other SCN1A missense mutations localized in the same region are associated to SMEB, a definite genotype-phenotype correlation has not yet been found, probably because other factors are involved in the pathogenesis of this type of epilepsy.",nocancer
"Clinical development of a failure detection-based online repositioning strategy for prostate IMRT--experiments, simulation, and dosimetry study. PURPOSE: To implement and evaluate clinic-ready adaptive imaging protocols for online patient repositioning (motion tracking) during prostate IMRT using treatment beam imaging supplemented by minimal, as-needed use of on-board kV. METHODS: The authors examine the two-step decision-making strategy: (1) Use cine-MV imaging and online-updated characterization of prostate motion to detect target motion that is potentially beyond a predefined threshold and (2) use paired MV-kV 3D localization to determine overthreshold displacement and, if needed, reposition the patient. Two levels of clinical implementation were evaluated: (1) Field-by-field based motion correction for present-day linacs and (2) instantaneous repositioning for new-generation linacs with capabilities of simultaneous MV-kV imaging and remote automatic couch control during treatment delivery. Experiments were performed on a Varian Trilogy linac in clinical mode using a 4D motion phantom programed with prostate motion trajectories taken from patient data. Dosimetric impact was examined using a 2D ion chamber array. Simulations were done for 536 trajectories from 17 patients. RESULTS: Despite the loss of marker detection efficiency caused by the MLC leaves sometimes obscuring the field at the marker's projected position on the MV imager, the field-by-field correction halved (from 23% to 10%) the mean percentage of time that target displacement exceeded a 3 mm threshold, as compared to no intervention. This was achieved at minimal cost in additional imaging (average of one MV-kV pair per two to three treatment fractions) and with a very small number of repositionings (once every four to five fractions). Also with low kV usage (approximation 2/fraction), the instantaneous repositioning approach reduced overthreshold time by more than 75% (23% to 5%) even with severe MLC blockage as often encountered in current IMRT and could reduce the overthreshold time tenfold (to < 2%) if the MLC blockage problem were relieved. The information acquired for repositioning using combined MV-kV images was found to have submillimeter accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrated with a current clinical setup that substantial reduction of adverse targeting effects of intrafraction prostate motion can be realized. The proposed adaptive imaging strategy incurs minimal imaging dose to the patient as compared to other stereoscopic imaging techniques.",cancer

"Litholytic property of Kulattha (Dolichous biflorus) vs potassium citrate in renal calculus disease: a comparative study. OBJECTIVE: Renal calculus disease is associated with recurrence after its surgical removal in large number of cases. Kulattha is acclaimed to have litholytic property in ayurvedic literature. We decided to compare the litholytic property of Kulattha with potassium citrate, an agent used to reduce stone recurrence in modern medicine. METHODS: Forty seven patients with diagnosis of calcium oxalate renal calculi were taken in study. Twenty four patients received Kulattha (Group I) and 23 patients were given potassium citrate(Group II) for a period of 6 months. The size of renal calculi was studied by periodic ultrasound assessment in both groups. RESULTS: Mean size of stone in group I at 0 month and at 6 month were 5.42 +/- 1.55 mm and 4.26 +/- 1.2 mm. mean size of stone in group II at 0 month and at 6 month was 6.46 +/- 3.08 mm and 4.64 +/- 1.40 mm. Statistical analysis showed that P value of less than 0.05 was seen in the first group from 0 to 6 month. There was no significant difference in the stone size within group II when the 3rd month and 6th month visit was compared with initial visit. CONCLUSION: Kulattha can be used to reduce the recurrence of calcium oxalate stone and it is shown to have a better result than the use of conventional potassium citrate in such patients.",nocancer
"Smoking practices of dental and oral health students at the University of the Western Cape. INTRODUCTION: The World Health Organisation code of practice on tobacco control urges health care professionals to lead by example by reducing smoking among them, act as role models for their patients and introduce tobacco control in the public health agenda of their country. AIMS: Describe dental and oral health student smoking practices, risk perception and the association between smoking status and providing smoking related advice to patients. METHOD: A descriptive, cross sectional study of dental and oral health students using a self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: The response rate was 62% (N = 375). Smoking status indicated that 15% were past smokers and 23% were current smokers (33.8% Male vs 17.6% Female: p < 0.001). The mean age of smoking initiation was 16 years (SD = 2.932). Students smoked because of ""addiction"", ""stress"", ""habit'; ""enjoyment"", and ""to socialise"". Only 22% of current smokers felt able to stop smoking. There were no significant differences between smokers and non-smokers in their perceived knowledge, confidence and skill to provide smoking related advice to patients. CONCLUSION: The increasing prevalence of smoking among females observed globally is also evident in this population.

"Laparascopic colon resection for cancer: evidence based results. About 90-92% of patients with carcinoma of the colon are treated surgically. For other surgeons, laparoscopic surgery for the treatment of malignancies remains controversial because of concerns about the adequacy of lymphadenectomy, the extent of resection, early findings of port-site metastasis and the lack of data on long-term results. In our experience, there are no differences between the laparoscopic and laparotomic techniques, and only advantages if the laparoscopic technique is use correctly. We essentially agree with the good results of many studies published in the last ten years, but we are extremely confident that it is necessary to have a good learning curve and a high-volume cases hospital to obtain good results through a laparoscopic approach. So laparoscopic colorectal surgery should be performed only by surgeons who have completed training in this approach and who perform the procedure often enough to maintain a good level of competence.",cancer

"Doxorubicin plus sorafenib vs doxorubicin alone in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: a randomized trial. CONTEXT: In a randomized phase 3 trial, 400 mg of sorafenib twice daily prolonged overall survival of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and Child-Pugh A disease. In a phase 1 study, sorafenib combined with doxorubicin, 60 mg/m(2), was well tolerated by patients with refractory solid tumors. The combination of sorafenib and doxorubicin in patients with advanced HCC has not been evaluated in a phase 2 or 3 trial. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of doxorubicin plus sorafenib compared with doxorubicin alone in patients with advanced HCC and Child-Pugh A disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: In a double-blind phase 2 multinational study, conducted from April 2005 to October 2006, 96 patients (76% male; median age, 65 years [range, 38-82 years]) with advanced HCC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2, Child-Pugh A status, and no prior systemic therapy were randomly assigned to receive 60 mg/m(2) of doxorubicin intravenously every 21 days plus either 400 mg of sorafenib or placebo orally twice a day. The date of the last patient's follow-up was April 2008. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Time to progression as determined by independent review. RESULTS: Following complete accrual, an unplanned early analysis for efficacy was performed by the independent data monitoring committee, so the trial was halted. The 2 patients remaining in the placebo group at that time were offered sorafenib. Based on 51 progressions, 63 deaths, and 70 events for progression-free survival, median time to progression was 6.4 months in the sorafenib-doxorubicin group (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.8-9.2), and 2.8 months (95% CI, 1.6-5) in the doxorubicin-placebo monotherapy group (P = .02). Median overall survival was 13.7 months (95% CI, 8.9--not reached) and 6.5 months (95% CI, 4.5-9.9; P = .006), and progression-free survival was 6.0 months (95% CI, 4.6-8.6) and 2.7 months (95% CI, 1.4-2.8) in these groups, respectively (P = .006). Toxicity profiles were similar to those for the single agents. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with advanced HCC, treatment with sorafenib plus doxorubicin compared with doxorubicin monotherapy resulted in greater median time to progression, overall survival, and progression-free survival. The degree to which this improvement may represent synergism between sorafenib and doxorubicin remains to be defined. The combination of sorafenib and doxorubicin is not yet indicated for routine clinical use. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00108953.",cancer

"Development and characterization of triazine based dendrimers for delivery of antitumor agent. In the present study we developed the novel kind of triazine dendrimers by utilizing differential reactivity of the cyanuric chloride (triazine trichloride) which overcome the limitations associated with the others classes of dendrimers like toxicity, low yield, high synthesis cost etc. Triazine dendrimers were synthesized by divergent method using triazine trichloride as core and diethanolamine as branching unit to avoid the use of protecting group and functional group interconversion up to third generation. These hydroxyl terminated dendrimers were characterized by FTIR, 1HNMR, 13CNMR, ES mass spectroscopy, and by elemental analysis. The yield of pure G3 dendrimers was 63%. This novel dendrimers increases the aqueous solubility of hydrophobic drug Paclitaxel up to 0.562 mg/ml as well as showed control release behavior. Hemolytic and toxicology studies of this dendrimer in mice showed no adverse toxicity to the kidneys and the liver up to 200 mg/kg dose (i.p). Triazine being a hydrophobic compound, the core of this dendrimer is hydrophobic and supposed to easily incorporate the hydrophobic guest while presence of hydroxyl group on periphery increases its water solubility and reduces its toxicity; and thus it is useful in various fields like gene delivery, MRI contrasting agents, vaccines or as solubilization tool.",nocancer

SETTING: Korea University Guro Hospital, Seoul. PATIENTS: A total of 2797 patients admitted between 1984 and 2003 with surgically treated, pathologically confirmed, primary gastric adenocarcinoma. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Long-term survival. RESULTS: The incidence of total gastrectomy and the number of retrieved lymph nodes increased during the study period. In curative cases, 5-year survival improved from 66.1% to 76.6%, and this survival gain was restricted to stages I, III, and IV. A Cox proportional hazards regression model showed that age, sex, tumor location, type of resection, stage, and the interaction between period of study and surgical subspecialty were independent prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: This large, long-term cohort study demonstrates that the management of gastric cancer has been largely successful, with favorable trends in prognostic factors. Successful outcomes are realized more often by gastric surgical specialists. Efforts must be made to improve the treatment of patients with stage II gastric cancer because the improvements in long-term results have plateaued.",cancer
"Retrospective analysis of pediatric cancer patients diagnosed with the pandemic H1N1 influenza infection. BACKGROUND: Limited data are available on disease characteristics and outcome of children with cancer who contracted the H1N1 influenza infection during the 2009 pandemic. METHODS: All 76 pediatric patients with cancer and documented H1N1 infection who presented to the Pediatric Department at King Hussein Cancer Center (KHCC) between October 1 and December 1, 2009 were reviewed for clinical characteristics and course of the disease. RESULTS: Two-thirds of the patients had hematological malignancies and half were receiving non-intensive chemotherapy at the time of infection. With the exception of two patients who needed pediatric intensive care unit admission, the course of the remaining patients was uneventful whether they were hospitalized or not. No deaths related to H1N1 influenza infection were reported. Sixty-three percent of patients became afebrile within 48 hr of receiving oseltamivir. One-third of hospitalized patients were discharged in < 3 days. CONCLUSION: The course of H1N1 influenza infection in children with cancer appears to be mild in most cases.",cancer
"Unilateral pleural effusion as a presenting manifestation of plasma cell myeloma (multiple myeloma): a case report. BACKGROUND: Malignant pleural effusion caused by multiple myeloma (MM) is rare, occurring as a late complication with a poor prognosis. Myelomatous pleural effusion (MPE) as an initial manifestation of the disease is extremely uncommon. CASE: A 54-year-old, previously healthy man presented with right-sided pleural effusion. Cytologic examination of the aspirated fluid revealed large, slightly pleomorphic atypical cells, some having eccentric nuclei. Immunocytochemistry (ICC) performed on cytospin smears and cell block sections gave a positive reaction for CD138, EMA and vimentin and a negative reaction for CK7, CK20, calretinin, S-100 and E-cadherin. CONCLUSION: Cytopathologists may be caught unawares by atypical presentations of hematologic malignancies. The diagnosis of MPE requires a high level of suspicion, and routine incorporation of ICC in the cytologic evaluation will ensure accurate diagnosis and proper patient management.",cancer
"Intestinal-type metaplasia in the original squamous epithelium of the cervix. There have been a number of reports on cervical carcinomas, both invasive and intraepithelial (CIN III), indicating the presence of intracellular mucins in the absence of glandular differentiation. Yet, the expression of such cells in the normal/original squamous epithelium of the cervix remains unexplored. We investigated the presence of mucin-distended goblet cells at this site, after examining retrospectively normal cervices from 250 hysterectomy specimens. Goblet cells were detected in 3.2% (8/250) of the cervices examined using haematoxylin and eosin stained sections and confirmed by mucin histochemistry: alcian blue (AB) pH 2.5, periodic acid-Schiff reaction with and without diastase digestion (PAS-d, PAS) and the combined AB/PAS. Additional sections were stained with Diazo and Masson-Fontana for argentaffin granules and Grimelius for argyrophil cells, but were all negative and no other cell types were identified. It is believed that this incomplete type of intestinal metaplasia is an acquired change in the cervix, derived from multi-potential stem cells of Mullerian duct origin.",cancer
"Oral rivaroxaban for symptomatic venous thromboembolism. BACKGROUND: Rivaroxaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor, may provide a simple, fixed-dose regimen for treating acute deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) and for continued treatment, without the need for laboratory monitoring. METHODS: We conducted an open-label, randomized, event-driven, noninferiority study that compared oral rivaroxaban alone (15 mg twice daily for 3 weeks, followed by 20 mg once daily) with subcutaneous enoxaparin followed by a vitamin K antagonist (either warfarin or acenocoumarol) for 3, 6, or 12 months in patients with acute, symptomatic DVT. In parallel, we carried out a double-blind, randomized, event-driven superiority study that compared rivaroxaban alone (20 mg once daily) with placebo for an additional 6 or 12 months in patients who had completed 6 to 12 months of treatment for venous thromboembolism. The primary efficacy outcome for both studies was recurrent venous thromboembolism. The principal safety outcome was major bleeding or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding in the initial-treatment study and major bleeding in the continued-treatment study. RESULTS: The study of rivaroxaban for acute DVT included 3449 patients: 1731 given rivaroxaban and 1718 given enoxaparin plus a vitamin K antagonist. Rivaroxaban had noninferior efficacy with respect to the primary outcome (36 events [2.1%], vs. 51 events with enoxaparin-vitamin K antagonist [3.0%]; hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44 to 1.04; P<0.001). The principal safety outcome occurred in 8.1% of the patients in each group. In the continued-treatment study, which included 602 patients in the rivaroxaban group and 594 in the placebo group, rivaroxaban had superior efficacy (8 events [1.3%], vs. 42 with placebo [7.1%]; hazard ratio, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.39; P<0.001). Four patients in the rivaroxaban group had nonfatal major bleeding (0.7%), versus none in the placebo group (P=0.11). CONCLUSIONS: Rivaroxaban offers a simple, single-drug approach to the short-term and continued treatment of venous thrombosis that may improve the benefit-to-risk profile of anticoagulation.

"Independent effects of personality and sex on self-estimated intelligence: evidence from Austria. The effects of sex and personality traits on self-estimates of intelligence were examined in a sample of 302 Austrian adults (143 men, 159 women). Confirming previous research, men had higher self-estimates of logical and spatial abilities than did women, and these differences were partly explained in terms of women's higher Neuroticism scores. Neuroticism (negatively) and Openness (positively) accounted significantly for variances in self-estimates of spatial and logical intelligence. However, sex had stronger direct and indirect effects on self-estimates of intelligence. Sex and personality effects appear to be largely independent. Thus, being male, emotionally stable, and open to new experiences is likely to result in higher self-estimates of spatial and logical abilities.",nocancer
"Real-time surveillance for tuberculosis using electronic health record data from an ambulatory practice in eastern Massachusetts. OBJECTIVE: Electronic health records (EHRs) have the potential to improve completeness and timeliness of tuberculosis (TB) surveillance relative to traditional reporting, particularly for culture-negative disease. We report on the development and validation of a TB detection algorithm for EHR data followed by implementation in a live surveillance and reporting system. METHODS: We used structured electronic data from an ambulatory practice in eastern Massachusetts to develop a screening algorithm aimed at achieving 100% sensitivity for confirmed active TB with the highest possible positive predictive value (PPV) for physician-suspected disease. We validated the algorithm in 16 years of retrospective electronic data and then implemented it in a real-time EHR-based surveillance system. We assessed PPV and the completeness of case capture relative to conventional reporting in 18 months of prospective surveillance. RESULTS: The final algorithm required a prescription for pyrazinamide, an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code for TB and prescriptions for two antituberculous medications, or an ICD-9 code for TB and an order for a TB diagnostic test. During validation, this algorithm had a PPV of 84% (95% confidence interval 78, 88) for physician-suspected disease. One-third of confirmed cases were culture-negative. All false-positives were instances of latent TB. In 18 months of prospective EHR-based surveillance with this algorithm, seven additional cases of physician-suspected active TB were detected, including two patients with culture-negative disease. A review of state health department records revealed no cases missed by the algorithm. CONCLUSIONS: Live, prospective TB surveillance using EHR data is feasible and promising.",nocancer
"Cytologic detection of recurrence in extramammary Paget's disease of the vulva: a report of two cases. BACKGROUND: Extramammary Paget's disease of the vulva (EMPDV) is a rare gynecologic malignancy. We examined two cases of EMPDV in which cytologic study led to early detection of disease recurrence. CASES: In case 1, a 71-year-old woman, recurrence was detected with malignant cells from the vaginal Papanicolaou smear a few months after radical surgery for endometrial cancer. An asymptomatic perineal erythematous lesion was identified and diagnosed as EMPDV by biopsy specimen. She underwent curative surgery, but during the follow-up period, malignant cells appeared again in her vaginal Papanicolaou smear, which led to early detection of the recurrent disease that was macroscopically invisible. In case 2, an 80-year-old woman presented with the complaint of perineal pruritus and was diagnosed with EMPDV. Twenty-two months after the curative primary surgery, bilateral groin lymphadenopathies appeared, and the cytologic specimen by fine needle aspiration biopsy from the lymph nodes led to early detection of the recurrence without her experiencing negative side effects such as severe pain. CONCLUSION: Cytologic examination is a simple but efficient diagnostic measure without major negative side effects, provided the procedures are applied adequately and performed correctly.",cancer
"Profound transient thrombocytopenia associated with 90Yttrium microsphere therapy for inoperable hepatoma. The use of Yttrium microspheres to treat unresectable hepatoma is increasing worldwide. Therapeutically, Yttrium microspheres show promising increases in survival and tumor response, as well as acceptable toxicities. Here, we report on a 67-year-old man with hepatitis C-related advanced-stage hepatoma. This patient received selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) using Yttrium microspheres (SIR-Spheres(R)). The patient displayed bone marrow suppression that resulted in a transient yet profound thrombocytopenia. To our knowledge, this is the first case of a hematologic complication as a consequence of the use of commercially available Yttrium microsphere devices.",cancer
"Radical prostatectomy versus watchful waiting for prostate cancer. BACKGROUND: The lack of evidence regarding the effectiveness of treatment options for clinically localised prostate cancer continues to impact on clinical decision-making. Two such options are radical prostatectomy (RP) and watchful waiting (WW). WW involves providing no initial treatment and monitoring the patient with the intention of providing palliative treatment if there is evidence of disease progression. OBJECTIVES: To compare the beneficial and harmful effects of RP versus WW for the treatment of localised prostate cancer. SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, ISI Science Citation Index, DARE and LILACS were searched through 30 July 2010. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing the effects of RP versus WW for clinically localised prostate cancer. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data extraction and quality assessment were carried out independently by two authors. MAIN RESULTS: Two trials met the inclusion criteria. Both trials commenced prior to the widespread availability of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening; hence the results may not be applicable to men with PSA-detected disease.One trial (N = 142), conducted in the US, was judged to be of poor quality. All cause (overall) mortality was not significantly different between RP and WW groups after fifteen years of follow up (Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.9 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.56 to 1.43).The second trial (N = 695), conducted in Scandinavia, was judged to be of good quality. After 12 years of follow up, the trial results were compatible with a beneficial effect of RP on the risks of overall mortality, prostate cancer mortality and distant metastases compared with WW but the precise magnitude of the effect is uncertain as indicated by the width of the confidence intervals for all estimates (risk difference (RD) -7.1% (95% CI -14.7 to 0.5); RD -5.4% (95% CI -11.1 to 0.2); RD -6.7% (95% CI -13.2 to -0.2), respectively). Compared to WW, RP increased the absolute risks of erectile dysfunction (RD 35% (95% CI 25 to 45)) and urinary leakage (RD 27% (95% CI 17 to 37)). These estimates must be interpreted cautiously as they are derived from data obtained from a self-administered questionnaire survey of a sample of the trial participants (N = 326), no baseline quality of life data were obtained and nerve-sparing surgery was not routinely performed on trial participants undergoing RP. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The existing trials provide insufficient evidence to allow confident statements to be made about the relative beneficial and harmful effects of RP and WW for patients with localised prostate cancer. The results of ongoing trials should help to inform treatment decisions for men with screen-detected localised prostate cancer.",cancer
"Lupus vulgaris with endopthalmitis--a rare manifestation of extrapulmonary tuberculosis in India. We report a case of 17-year-old girl who presented with gradual destruction of the nose along with endopthalmitis and loss of vision of the left eye. On nasal examination, left alae nasi and nasal cartilage was destroyed. Left eye showed signs of endopthalmitis with pthisis bulbi with complete loss of vision. Skin biopsy, FNAC of the lymph nodes were suggestive of tubercular etiology. However, patient did not have any evidence of pulmonary TB. We report this case due to the rare clinical features.

"Attitudes toward fertility preservation in female cancer patients. OBJECTIVE: To survey patient attitudes toward fertility preservation techniques in the case of infertility from cancer treatment. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey on adolescent cancer patients (ACPs) aged 15-21 years and their parents, as well as on breast cancer patients (BCPs). RESULTS: A total of 69% of ACPs were aware of the problem of infertility. However, only 31% recalled being spoken to about treatment effects on fertility. Parents were significantly more likely to have been spoken to (58% vs. 31%, p < 0.022) and tended to be more interested in fertility preservation. The groups were in agreement that cancer therapy should not be delayed. Of the BCPs, 67% expressed substantial concern regarding infertility. They were more likely to have been spoken to and tended to be younger and nulliparous, although statistical significance was not reached. Again, most were unwilling to delay therapy. CONCLUSION: There is an interest infertility preservation amongst our patients, but the medical information received may influence, to a certain extent, the attitudes of the patients. Greater emphasis should therefore be placed on counseling the patient during the treatment planning process.",cancer
"Defining asbestos: differences between the built and natural environments. Asbestos - while most think they know what this material is, few understand the current issues surrounding it. Few would also realize that asbestos is the form of a mineral, and even fewer would know that there are different types of asbestos, that not only had different industrial applications, but pose differing health risks when inhaled. Asbestos was in wide-spread use mid-last century in many consumer products, and no doubt saved thousands of lives, but by the latter part of last century concerns over its health risk caused its use to wane, to the point it was removed from many buildings. So in many ways the asbestos story was coming to an end in the 1990s, but two events in the USA - the vermiculite ore produced from Libby, Montana which contained amphibole asbestos and was used in a million homes in the USA as attic insulation and the concern for exposure to asbestos occurring in its natural setting in El Dorado Hills, California led to an increased concern of the potential for low-level environmental exposure to asbestos to the general public. The current dilemma we find ourselves in, especially in the USA, deals with the relationships between our knowledge of handling asbestos and an understanding of its risk potential in the built environment versus the natural environment. And one perfect metaphor for this is the term used by many non-geologists to differentiate asbestos in the built vs natural environment - 'naturally occurring asbestos'. Clearly a misstatement, but only one of many we must deal with as we struggle to understand the risk to humans of natural occurrences of asbestos. This paper will try and address some of these issues centering around those occurring in the USA.",nocancer
"Early complications after nipple-sparing mastectomy and immediate breast reconstruction with silicone prosthesis: results of 214 procedures. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: breast reconstruction with silicone prosthesis following nipple-sparing mastectomy has become widely accepted as a reconstruction option in women requiring mastectomy for cancer. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence and some factors influencing early local complications in patients undergoing NSM with immediate implant reconstruction. MATERIAL AND METHODS: prospective study was performed on a consecutive series of 214 breast reconstructions in 205 patients. All complications during the six weeks after surgery were recorded. 42 prostheses were implanted after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 27 patients previously had radiotherapy due to breast conserving surgery and in all other cases surgery was the pri-mary treatment for cancer. RESULTS: the overall six-week complication rate was 16% (35) and included: major skin flap necrosis (4%, 9 procedures), minor skin necrosis (3%, 7), major infection (2%, 5), minor infection (3%, 7), prolonged seroma formation (3%, 6), haematoma (1%, 2) and epidermolysis (1%, 2). In 6% (12) reconstruction procedures explantation of prosthesis was done. Neoadjuvant chemo-therapy and radiotherapy were not associated with higher rate of complications. CONCLUSION: nipple-sparing mastectomy with immediate implant reconstruction has acceptable morbidity rate in the hand of experienced oncoplastic surgeon and therefore should be considered as treatment option to women requiring mastectomy.",cancer
"Non-hormonal treatment of vasomotor symptoms in gynecological cancer patients. Gynaecological cancer patients generally suffer from an earlier and more severe menopausal syndrome than the general female population. Hormone replacement therapy is often contraindicated and there are non-hormonal treatments that are proven to be more effective than placebo in randomized controlled trials, e.g., some antidepressants, gabapentine and clonidine. The main limits to the use of these drugs in controlling hot flashes are the off-label use for this purpose, the very short follow-up and the fact that data come from studies performed on breast cancer, not on gynecological cancer patients. Patients believe that drugs derived from plants could be effective in relieving hot flashes and that they are harmless. Evidence is contrary to this belief and estrogen-sensitive cancer patients should be warned of the potential, though very weak, estrogenic effect of phytoestrogens and other ""natural"" drugs, and that their efficacy is close to that of a placebo.",cancer
"Clinical governance for elderly patients with renal insufficiency. Community care programs. From a clinical governance perspective, process management is essential because it allows attention to be focused on the health problems of the people affected by illness, creating care programs that arise out of a holistic vision. This is all the more true when the people involved have specific care needs, like the elderly and patients with chronic illnesses whose primary place of care is outside the hospital and who, in any case, require continuity and coordination of care. This group certainly includes elderly patients with chronic kidney disease, the management of which has significant effects on health care settings. The national and regional dialysis and transplant registers currently provide partial data on this phenomenon, but our information is incomplete. What we lack is an unambiguous, uniform care program which addresses itself to community care for the elderly with chronic kidney disease and which, above all, places the nephrologist in a leading role. The issue is to provide a suitable solution for this anomaly, so that by putting aside an anachronistic hospital-centered vision, the nephrologist can move out into the community and come into contact with the sorts of cases which currently remain outside his or her field of vision. It is to be hoped that the Italian Society of Nephrology will spearhead this initiative by becoming more aware of the structural and organizational changes that the Italian health system is currently undergoing.",nocancer
"Systemic chemotherapy--before or after radical surgery in treatment of patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma? PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATION: The aim of the study was to analyze whether application of systemic chemotherapy prior to radical surgery in patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma influences the length of the progression-free period and overall survival rate. METHODS: This study analyzes two groups of patients in the period 2006-2009. The first group received systemic chemotherapy prior to radical surgery. The second group first had radical surgery after which systemic chemotherapy was administered. The therapeutic response to systemic chemotherapy was analyzed as well as progression-free survival and overall survival which was calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log rank test. RESULTS: Statistical analysis showed that patients who were administered systemic chemotherapy prior to radical surgery have significantly better progression-free survival as well as overall survival. Progression-free survival in patients who were first treated with systemic chemotherapy after which radical surgery followed was equal to 28 months and was significantly longer (p = 0.001) than progression-free survival in patients who were first subjected to radical surgery; it equaled 13 months, while the overall survival equaled 43 and 36 months, respectively. CONCLUSION: Application of systemic chemotherapy prior to radical surgery has a significant influence on the length of the progression-free period and on the length of overall survival of patients affected by advanced ovarian cancer.",cancer
"Measuring output factors of small fields formed by collimator jaws and multileaf collimator using plastic scintillation detectors. PURPOSE: As the practice of using high-energy photon beams to create therapeutic radiation fields of subcentimeter dimensions (as in intensity-modulated radiotherapy or stereotactic radiosurgery) grows, so too does the need for accurate verification of beam output at these small fields in which standard practices of dose verification break down. This study investigates small-field output factors measured using a small plastic scintillation detector (PSD), as well as a 0.01 cm3 ionization chamber. Specifically, output factors were measured with both detectors using small fields that were defined by either the X-Y collimator jaws or the multileaf collimator (MLC). METHODS: A PSD of 0.5 mm diameter and 2 mm length was irradiated with 6 and 18 MV linac beams. The PSD was positioned vertically at a source-to-axis distance of 100 cm, at 10 cm depth in a water phantom, and irradiated with fields ranging in size from 0.5 x 0.5 to 10 x 10 cm2. The field sizes were defined either by the collimator jaws alone or by a MLC alone. The MLC fields were constructed in two ways: with the closed leaves (i.e., those leaves that were not opened to define the square field) meeting at either the field center line or at a 4 cm offset from the center line. Scintillation light was recorded using a CCD camera and an estimation of error in the median-filtered signals was made using the bootstrapping technique. Measurements were made using a CC01 ionization chamber under conditions identical to those used for the PSD. RESULTS: Output factors measured by the PSD showed close agreement with those measured using the ionization chamber for field sizes of 2.0 x 2.0 cm2 and above. At smaller field sizes, the PSD obtained output factors as much as 15% higher than those found using the ionization chamber by 0.6 x 0.6 cm2 jaw-defined fields. Output factors measured with no offset of the closed MLC leaves were as much as 20% higher than those measured using a 4 cm leaf offset. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' results suggest that PSDs provide a useful and possibly superior alternative to existing dosimetry systems for small fields, as they are inherently less susceptible to volume-averaging and perturbation effects than larger, air-filled ionization chambers. Therefore, PSDs may provide more accurate small-field output factor determination, regardless of the collimation mechanism.",cancer

"Surgical management of recurrent ovarian cancer: the advantage of collaborative surgical management and a multidisciplinary approach. OBJECTIVE: Primary cytoreductive surgery is well accepted in the initial management of ovarian cancer with a goal of maximal tumor reduction. The role of cytoreductive surgery at disease recurrence is controversial and guidelines are not standardized. We aimed to review cases of women with recurrent ovarian cancer who were collaboratively managed by two teams of oncologic surgeons with different areas of surgical expertise. METHODS: A list of 616 patients with recurrent ovarian cancer from 1995 to 2009 was generated at a single institution. 20 cases of recurrent ovarian cancer were identified that were managed collaboratively. Data collected included date of diagnosis, initial treatment, recurrence date, location and number of sites of recurrence, secondary cytoreductive procedure performed, residual disease after surgery, pre-operative status, post-operative course, and pathologic findings. RESULTS: Of the 20 cases that fit eligibility criteria, 11 were completely resected, 5 were incompletely resected, and 4 were biopsied only. Median disease-free interval following primary surgery was 18 months (6-147). Median interval from diagnosis to collaborative cytoreduction was 63 months (13-170). Our patients had metastatic disease to the liver (11), lymph nodes (8), the diaphragm (7), other locations including colon, pancreas, lung, adrenal, kidney (9). Two patients had additional miliary disease. All patients underwent joint surgical management by gynecologic and surgical oncologists. There were no deaths in the immediate post-operative period. The 5 year survival rate was 45% following the joint surgical effort, with a median post-collaborative surgery survival duration of 42 months. CONCLUSIONS: Previous studies document survival benefit of surgery for women with recurrent ovarian cancer when there has been a long disease-free interval, localized pelvic or intra-abdominal recurrences and an optimal performance status. Most gynecologic oncologists do not perform extensive liver or diaphragm resections or lymph node excision above the renal vessels; thus, collaboration with a surgical oncologist is a viable option. In this small descriptive study, the feasibility of this reasonably well-tolerated approach, with possible survival benefit, is documented.",cancer
"Predictors of balance in young, middle-aged, and late middle-aged women. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relationships between physiological variables and balance and the potential predictors of static and dynamic balance in young (n = 30, 18-25 years), middle-aged (n = 26, 35-45 years), and late middle-aged (n = 29, 55-64 years) women. METHODS: Maximal leg strength, hip and ankle flexibility, total and regional body composition, and total and regional bone mineral density were measured. The NeuroCom Balance Master (NeuroCom International, Inc, Clackamas, Oregon) assessed static postural stability (Modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction on Balance [MCTSIB], eyes open [EO] on foam; Unilateral Stance [US] eyes open and eyes closed [EC]) and dynamic balance (Tandem Walk [TW] and Step Quick and Turn [SQT]). RESULTS: The youngest group was significantly stronger (P = .001), had greater bone mineral density (P = .001-.028), lower percentage of fat (P = .001), and greater bone-free lean body mass (P = .028 for arms and P = .004 for legs) than the older groups. Hip and ankle flexibility was similar between groups and only 2 measures of balance (US EO and SQT) were significantly different, with the oldest group being significantly less stable than the other 2 groups (P = .001 and P = .018, respectively). Regression analyses determined only 1 significant prediction equation for balance for the youngest group (TW Sway Velocity), 2 significant prediction equations for the middle-aged group (US EC Sway Velocity and SQT Sway), and 5 significant prediction equations for the oldest group (MCTSIB EC Sway Velocity, US EO Sway Velocity, US EC Sway Velocity, TW Sway Velocity, and SQT Sway). CONCLUSION: Measures of balance were easier to predict as age increased, and there were more significant correlations between predictors of balance when balance was assessed dynamically (TW and SQT) rather than statically (MCTSIB and US).",nocancer
"Psychogenic seizures: A review and description of pitfalls in their acute diagnosis and management in the emergency department. Patients with psychogenic (nonepileptic) seizures (PS) are frequently encountered by clinicians in the emergency medicine setting. Despite the tendency for these patients to seek frequent medical attention, the time between onset of symptoms and diagnosis is often more than 7 years. The cause of PS is multifactorial, but most patients are thought to have an underlying dissociative condition. The diagnostic evaluation in the emergency department is challenging and relies heavily on clinical suspicion, based on historical and physical features. Laboratory testing and therapeutic maneuvers are of limited utility; prolonged video electroencephalography is the diagnostic gold standard. Once the diagnosis has been secured, the mainstay of treatment involves addressing the underlying psychological distress.",nocancer
"Quality improvement in neurology: AAN Parkinson disease quality measures: report of the Quality Measurement and Reporting Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology. BACKGROUND: Measuring the quality of health care is a fundamental step toward improving health care and is increasingly used in pay-for-performance initiatives and maintenance of certification requirements. Measure development to date has focused on primary care and common conditions such as diabetes; thus, the number of measures that apply to neurologic care is limited. The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) identified the need for neurologists to develop measures of neurologic care and to establish a process to accomplish this. OBJECTIVE: To adapt and test the feasibility of a process for independent development by the AAN of measures for neurologic conditions for national measurement programs. METHODS: A process that has been used nationally for measure development was adapted for use by the AAN. Topics for measure development are chosen based upon national priorities, available evidence base from a systematic literature search, gaps in care, and the potential impact for quality improvement. A panel composed of subject matter and measure development methodology experts oversees the development of the measures. Recommendation statements and their corresponding level of evidence are reviewed and considered for development into draft candidate measures. The candidate measures are refined by the expert panel during a 30-day public comment period and by review by the American Medical Association for Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) II codes. All final AAN measures are approved by the AAN Board of Directors. RESULTS: Parkinson disease (PD) was chosen for measure development. A review of the medical literature identified 258 relevant recommendation statements. A 28-member panel approved 10 quality measures for PD that included full specifications and CPT II codes. CONCLUSION: The AAN has adapted a measure development process that is suitable for national measurement programs and has demonstrated its capability to independently develop quality measures.",nocancer
"Clinico-epidemiological study of leprosy in an urban area of West Bengal. A cross-sectional study was carried out at Naihati municipal area in West Bengal to study the prevalence and some epidemiological factors in transmission of leprosy. Side by side, the validity of WHO operational classification was also tested by using slit skin smear examination as gold standard. A group of trained paramedical workers, supervised by epidemiologist conducted house to house survey work. Experienced dermatologist and neurologist examined suspected cases. Overall prevalence of leprosy were 9.9 per 10000, of which 53% were new cases. Epidemiologically manual workers, living in slums and unhygienic surroundings had significantly higher risk of developing leprosy. Sensitivity and specificity of WHO operational classification (> 5 skin lesion= MB) was found to be quite high (sensitivity 85.9% and specificity 83.3%) in this study. However addition of > 2 nerve lesions to this criteria increase sensitivity to 90.1% without much affecting the specificity (79.8%).",nocancer
"Single incision laparoscopic anterior resection for cancer using a ""QuadiPort access system"". BACKGROUND: Single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is developing rapidly and different devices are already available. However there is limited data in the literature about single port laparoscopic colorectal surgery. AIMS: We report the first case of a single incision laparoscopic anterior resection for cancer using the device ""QuadiPort Access System. METHODS: A 66 year old female affected by adenocarcinoma of the rectosigmoid junction underwent a radical single incision laparoscopic anterior resection performed by an experienced laparoscopic team. RESULTS: The preoperative staging was T2NOM0. The total operative time was 135 min. Length of hospital stay was 6 days. The length of the specimen was 27 cm and 21 nodes were isolated. The pathological examination showed adenocarcinoma staged T3N2MX; G2. There was no postoperative morbidity and at the 6 month follow-up, the patient presented in well condition with no complications and free from cancer. CONCLUSION: Single incision laparoscopic anterior resection for locally advanced high rectal cancer seems to be feasible and the ""QuadiPort Access System seems to be a valid device. To evaluate outcomes and costeffectiveness of SILS versus the standard laparoscopic colorectal surgery multicenter prospective randomised trials are necessary and the ""QuadiPort Access System"" could prove to be the device of choice.",cancer
"Breast cancer incidence in the randomized PEARL trial of lasofoxifene in postmenopausal osteoporotic women. BACKGROUND: Currently available selective estrogen receptor modulators reduce the risk of breast cancer, but they are not widely used. In the Postmenopausal Evaluation and Risk-Reduction with Lasofoxifene (PEARL) trial, lasofoxifene was shown to reduce the risk of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, nonvertebral and vertebral fractures, coronary artery disease, and stroke, but the effects on total breast cancer (invasive and ductal carcinoma in situ, ER+ and estrogen receptor-negative [ER-]) and ER+ invasive breast cancer are unknown. METHODS: Postmenopausal women (n = 8556) aged 59-80 years with low bone density and normal mammograms were randomly assigned to two doses of lasofoxifene (0.25 and 0.5 mg) or placebo. The primary endpoints of the PEARL trial were incidence of ER+ breast cancer and nonvertebral fractures at 5 years. A nested case-control study of 49 incident breast cancer case patients and 156 unaffected control subjects from the PEARL trial was performed to evaluate treatment effects on risk of total and ER+ invasive breast cancer by baseline serum estradiol and sex hormone-binding globulin levels using logistic regression models. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate risk of total breast cancer and ER+ invasive breast cancer using intention-to-treat analysis. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Breast cancer was confirmed in 49 women. Compared with placebo, 0.5 mg of lasofoxifene statistically significantly reduced the risk of total breast cancer by 79% (hazard ratio = 0.21; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.08 to 0.55) and ER+ invasive breast cancer by 83% (hazard ratio = 0.17; 95% CI = 0.05 to 0.57). The effects of 0.5 mg of lasofoxifene on total breast cancer were similar regardless of Gail score, whereas the effects were markedly stronger for women with baseline estradiol levels greater than the median (odds ratio = 0.11; 95% CI = 0.02 to 0.51) vs those with levels less than the median (odds ratio = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.16 to 3.79; P(interaction) = .04). CONCLUSION: A 0.5-mg dose of lasofoxifene appears to reduce the risks of both total and ER+ invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.",cancer
"Masitinib for the treatment of systemic and cutaneous mastocytosis with handicap: a phase 2a study. Treatment options for patients suffering from indolent forms of mastocytosis remain inadequate with the hyperactivation of mast cells responsible for many of the disease's systemic manifestations. Masitinib is a potent and highly selective oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor. A combined inhibition of c-Kit and Lyn make it particularly efficient in controlling the activity of mast cells and therefore, of potential therapeutic benefit in mastocytosis. Masitinib was administered to 25 patients diagnosed as having systemic or cutaneous mastocytosis with related handicap (i.e., disabilities associated with flushes, depression, pruritus and quality-of-life) at the initial dose levels of 3 or 6 mg/kg/day over 12 weeks. In accordance with the AFIRMM study, response was based upon change of clinical symptoms associated with patient handicap at week 12 relative to baseline, regardless of disease subtype. Improvement was observed in all primary endpoints at week 12 including a reduction of flushes, Hamilton rating, and pruritus as compared with baseline by 64% (P = 0.0005), 43% (P = 0.0049), and 36% (P = 0.0077), respectively. An overall clinical response was observed in 14/25 patients (56%; [95%CI = 37%-75%]), with sustainable improvement observed throughout an extension phase (>60 weeks). Common adverse events were edema (44%), nausea (44%), muscle spasms (28%), and rash (28%), the majority of which were of mild or moderate severity with a significant decline in frequency observed after 12 weeks of treatment. One patient experienced a serious adverse event of reversible agranulocytosis. Masitinib is a promising treatment for indolent forms of mastocytosis with handicap and indicates acceptable tolerability for long-term treatment regimens.",cancer
"Measuring the collateral network pressure to minimize paraplegia risk in thoracoabdominal aneurysm resection. OBJECTIVE: To minimize paraplegia during thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair, the concept of the collateral network was developed. That is, spinal cord perfusion is provided by an interconnecting complex of vessels in the intraspinal, paraspinous, and epidural space and in the paravertebral muscles, including intercostal and lumbar segmental as well as subclavian and hypogastric arteries. METHODS: Collateral network pressure was measured with a catheter in the distal end of a ligated segmental artery in pigs and human beings. RESULTS: In the pig, collateral network pressure was 75% of the simultaneous mean aortic pressure. With complete segmental arterial ligation, it fell to 27% of baseline, recovering to 40% at 24 hours and 90% at 120 hours. Spinal cord injury occurred in approximately 50% of animals. When all segmental arteries were taken in 2 stages a week apart, collateral network pressure fell only to 50% to 70% of baseline, and spinal cord injury was rare. In human beings, baseline collateral network pressure also was 75% of mean aortic pressure, fell in proportion to the number of segmental arteries ligated, and began recovery within 24 hours. Collateral network pressure was lower with nonpulsatile distal bypass than with pulsatile perfusion. CONCLUSIONS: After subtraction of a measure of spinal cord outflow pressure (cerebrospinal fluid pressure or central venous pressure), collateral network pressure provides a clinically useful estimate of spinal cord perfusion pressure.",nocancer
"Target delineation of gross tumor volume for radiation therapy planning using fusion images of (1)(8)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and computed tomography. Modern radiation therapy planning (RTP) has been performed using a larger number of images obtained with computed tomography (CT), named 3-dimensional RTP. Recently, F-18-flurodeoxyglucose position emission tomography (FDG-PET) has been used for RTP. FDG-PET can often distinguish between benign and malignant lesions when CT and magnetic resonance cannot. Although FDG-PET images lack anatomical precision (Fig. 1A), fusion images of FDG-PET and CT (PET/CT) have been extremely useful for determining the active sites of malignant disease. Particularly for patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma, both primary lesions and active lymph node matastases are well recognized (Fig. 1B). With PET/CT, which yields fewer false-negative results, smaller target volumes for radiation therapy can be delineated than with other imaging modalities (Fig. 2). The small radiation field (Fig. 3) leads to less toxicity in normal tissue, allows high radiation dose to be administered, and improves local control.",cancer
"Racial disparities in smoking-attributable mortality and years of potential life lost --- Missouri, 2003-2007. An estimated 443,000 deaths in the United States occur each year as a result of cigarette smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke. These deaths cost the nation approximately $97 billion in lost productivity and $96 billion in health-care costs. During 2000-2004 in Missouri, smoking caused 9,600 deaths, 132,000 years of potential life lost (YPLL), $2.4 billion in productivity losses, and $2.2 billion in smoking-related health-care expenditures annually. To limit the adverse health consequences of tobacco use, states implement comprehensive tobacco control programs that identify disparities among population groups and target those disproportionately affected by tobacco use. This report compares the public health burden of smoking among whites and blacks in Missouri by estimating the number of smoking-attributable deaths and YPLL in these population subgroups during 2003-2007. The findings indicate that the average annual smoking-attributable mortality (SAM) rate in the state was 18% higher for blacks (338 deaths per 100,000) than for whites (286 deaths per 100,000). The relative difference in smoking-attributable mortality rates between blacks and whites was larger for men (28%) than women (11%). For Missouri, these estimates provide an important benchmark for measuring the success of tobacco control programs in decreasing the burden of smoking-related diseases in these populations and reaffirm the need for full implementation of the state's comprehensive tobacco control program.",cancer
"Analysis of therapeutic choices for slit ventricle syndrome after cyst-peritoneal shunting for temporal arachnoid cysts in children. OBJECT: The goal in this study was to investigate early diagnostic evidence, optimal therapeutic strategies, and prophylactic methods for slit ventricle syndrome (SVS) in patients with temporal lobe arachnoid cysts who received cyst-peritoneal (CP) shunts. METHODS: Six cases of SVS in patients with temporal lobe arachnoid cysts who received CP shunts were treated by the senior authors in 2 institutions between January 2005 and January 2009. The radiological data, treatment process, and therapeutic results were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: There were 4 boys and 2 girls, whose mean age at presentation was 4 years and 1 month. The main clinical symptoms were severe headache, nausea, vomiting, and decreasing eyesight. Radiological studies showed normal or slightly smaller than normal ventricles, and arachnoid cysts that had shrunk dramatically. The most effective treatment for SVS was to replace the original shunts with devices that had a programmable valve, or if this was unsuccessful, to replace the original shunts with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts. All symptoms in these patients disappeared, and the mean follow-up duration was 24 months. CONCLUSIONS: The SVS presents more often in patients with hydrocephalus who undergo VP shunting. However, it is also a serious complication in patients with arachnoid cysts who receive a CP shunt. The SVS is not a single condition; rather, different pathophysiological conditions can underlie this complicated syndrome. Because there are no striking morphological changes on radiological studies of the SVS in the patients with CP shunts, it is not easy for this syndrome to be diagnosed in time and treated rationally. Misdiagnosis and delayed treatment usually occur. The use of programmable shunts or VP shunts to replace the original shunt is an optimal therapeutic choice. The use of low-pressure shunts to treat arachnoid cysts should be abandoned unless dictated by specific indications.",cancer
"Cancer health disparities persist among African Americans in Wisconsin. BACKGROUND: Cancer incidence and mortality rates have decreased over the last few decades, yet not all groups have benefited equally from these successes. This has resulted in increased disparities in cancer burden among various population groups. OBJECTIVE: This study examined trends in absolute and relative disparities in overall cancer incidence and mortality rates between African American and white residents of Wisconsin during the period 1995-2006. METHODS: Cancer incidence data were obtained from the Wisconsin Cancer Reporting System. Mortality data were accessed from the National Center for Health Statistics' public use mortality file. Trends in incidence and mortality rates during 1995-2006 for African Americans and whites were calculated and changes in relative disparity were measured using rate ratios. RESULTS: With few exceptions, African American incidence and mortality rates were higher than white rates in every year of the period 1995-2006. Although cancer mortality and incidence declined for both groups over the period, relative racial disparities in rates persisted over the period and account for about a third of African American cancer deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Elimination of cancer health disparities will require further research into the many contributing factors, as well as into effective interventions to address them. In Wisconsin, policymakers, health administrators, and health care professsionals need to balance resources carefully and set appropriate priorities to target racial inequities in cancer burden.",cancer
"Primary signet-ring cell carcinoma of the lung: a report of 2 cases. BACKGROUND: Signet-ring cell carcinoma is a distinct subtype of mucin-producing adenocarcinoma that originates in various organs, particularly the stomach. However, primary signet-ring cell carcinoma of the lung is an extremely rare condition. The preoperative identification of signet-ring cells by cytologic examination is vital because signet-ring cell carcinoma of the lung has been reported to have a worse prognosis than ordinary adenocarcinoma. In this study, we present 2 cases of primary signet-ring cell carcinoma of the lung in conjunction with their cytomorphologic features. CASES: Bronchial brush and wash samples were obtained from the lungs of a 63-year-old woman and a 65-year-old man for the evaluation of lung tumors. Examination of the bronchial samples revealed many large clusters of atypical cells containing abundant intracytoplasmic mucin. Although the clusters were equivocal in the first case, the presence of more atypical cell clusters led to the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSION: Signet-ring cell carcinoma should be considered when many atypical round cells with abundant intracytoplasmic mucin--namely, signet-ring cells--are observed along with adenocarcinomatous cells.",cancer
"Nocturnal sleep disturbances as a predictor of suicide attempts among psychiatric outpatients: a clinical, epidemiologic, prospective study. OBJECTIVE: Nocturnal sleep disturbances, including insomnia and recurrent nightmares, represent common distressing sleep complaints that might have important prognostic and therapeutic implications in psychiatric patients. The present study aimed at investigating nocturnal sleep disturbances in relation to the risk of suicide attempts in a consecutive cohort of psychiatric outpatients. METHOD: Participants attending a psychiatric outpatient clinic in Hong Kong were recruited into the study with a detailed sleep questionnaire assessment. The questionnaire was distributed between May and June 2006. Relevant clinical information, with a comprehensive clinical history of patients since their attendance at psychiatric services and 1 year after completion of their questionnaires, was reviewed. RESULTS: The final study population consisted of 1,231 psychiatric outpatients with a mean age of 42.5 years (SD = 11.3; range, 18-65). Both frequent insomnia and recurrent nightmares were significantly and independently associated with an increased incidence of suicide attempts 1 year after questionnaire assessment (insomnia: OR = 6.96; 95% CI, 1.21-39.97; recurrent nightmares: OR = 8.17; 95% CI, 1.06-63.13) and an increase in lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts (insomnia: OR = 1.55; 95% CI, 1.06-2.25; recurrent nightmares: OR = 2.43; 95% CI, 1.51-3.91). Comorbid insomnia and nightmares had increased odds of lifetime prevalence (OR = 2.43; 95% CI, 1.53-3.85) and 1-year incidence of suicidal risk (OR = 17.08; 95% CI, 2.64-110.40). Antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (OR = 1.52; 95% CI, 1.02-2.25), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (OR = 2.10; 95% CI, 1.15-3.83), heterocyclics (OR = 2.78; 95% CI, 1.21-6.42), and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics (OR = 1.54; 95% CI, 1.02-2.33) were independently associated with recurrent nightmares after adjustment for confounding variables. CONCLUSIONS: Nocturnal sleep disturbances, particularly frequent insomnia and recurrent nightmares, were independently associated with enhanced suicidal risk among psychiatric patients. Future studies are warranted to investigate the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism and interventional responses.",nocancer
"The feasibility and efficacy of eccentric exercise with older cancer survivors: a preliminary study. INTRODUCTION: Older individuals who have survived cancer and the commensurate treatment often experience a reduced quality of life in part due to their impaired muscular abilities and deficits in mobility. The purpose of this preliminary study was to determine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of resistance exercise via negative, eccentrically induced work (RENEW) with older cancer survivors. METHODS: Older cancer survivors with a perception of moderate muscle weakness and fatigue participated in 12 weeks of RENEW. Measures of feasibility included (1) the participant's ability to progress the total amount of work of RENEW; (2) whether peak knee extension torque production became impaired; and (3) whether RENEW induced leg muscle pain as measured on a visual analog scale. The preliminary measure of efficacy included the performance of a timed up-and-go mobility test. RESULTS: The participants significantly increased the total average work per week over the 12 weeks of RENEW. Participants increased (P < .001) their work approximately 3-fold from week 3 (7.6 [5.11 kJ) to week 12 (22.1 [14.8] kJ) without muscle pain over the 12-week RENEW training period. Knee extension peak torque production improved (11%) significantly (P = .02) (pretest: 248 [92] N; posttest: 275 [99] N) after 12 weeks of RENEW. The time to perform the up-and-go test improved (14%) significantly (P < .001) (pretest: 8.4 [2.7]; posttest: 7.2 [2.3] s) after 12 weeks of RENEW, suggesting preliminary efficacy. CONCLUSION: Collectively, RENEW appears feasible and potentially efficacious for older, weak, and fatigued cancer survivors. Implications for Cancer Survivors: The use of eccentric muscle exercise may be ideally suited for older cancer survivors due to its high force and low energetic-cost capabilities.",cancer

"Significance of PET/CT in determining actual TNM staging for patients with various lung cancers. We investigated the difference in TNM stage of lung cancer provided by PET/CT (combining positron emission tomography and computed tomography) as compared with TNM stage obtained with conventional imaging studies (CI) with contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with iron contrast media. Sixty-seven cases of lung cancer were included in this study. Overall, the rate of correction of TNM staging was 70.1% after PET/CT. The correction rate for each factor was 32.8% in T, 37.3% in N, and 37.3% in M. High rates of correction were observed in small cell lung cancer (SCLC), with 75% (6/8 cases) obtained by PET/CT. When SCLCs were divided into limited disease (n = 6) involving 1 hemithorax, including mediastinal and contralateral hilar lymph nodes, and others (extensive disease, n = 2), the correction rate was as high as 80% for limited disease. In conclusion, PET/CT can provide actual TNM staging and recognition for oncologists in staging, which would not mislead to selection of inadequate subsequent treatment.",cancer

"Fine needle aspiration cytology of metastatic renal cell carcinoma of the left breast in a woman with a known right breast primary: a case report. BACKGROUND: Metastatic tumors in the breast from extramammary primary malignancies are uncommon, and the kidney has been the site of a primary in very rare cases. CASE: Fine needle aspiration cytology and immunohistochemical findings in a 70-year-old woman are described in whom a left-sided breast mass from a metastatic clear cell (conventional) carcinoma of the kidney was diagnosed due to unusual cellular findings. A few years earlier, the patient had a right-sided primary breast carcinoma for which a lumpectomy with clear margins had been done. Also, since on comparison the cell pattern of the breast primary did not match the morphology of the clear cell tumor on the left side, further immunohistochemical staining was undertaken on sections of cell blocks and smears from the aspirate and confirmed positivity for oil-red-O, CD10, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) marker and AE1/AE3 and negativity for ER, PR, CK7, HER2/neu and mucus, which favored the diagnosis of RCC. Furthermore, the ER, PR, CK7, HER2/neu were positive in sections of the primary breast carcinoma, while the staining for CD10, RCC marker and AE1/AE3 were negative. On further inquiry following cytodiagnosis, it was found that a few years earlier the patient had had a left nephrectomy for a clear cell carcinoma. CONCLUSION: The findings emphasize a cautious approach in interpreting cytologic findings in aspirates with unusual cell features that do not resemble those of a primary breast carcinoma and warrant further workup using selective immunohistochemical stains, which can be useful in resolving the diagnostic dilemma of distinguishing a primary from a metastatic carcinoma.",cancer
"Nasal myoepithelioma removed through endonasal endoscopic surgery: a case report. Myoepithelioma is a rare neoplasm that can occur in either the major or minor salivary gland and accounts for less than 1% of salivary gland neoplasms. We report a rare case of a nasal myoepithelioma that originated from the nasal inferior turbinate. The tumor, measuring 50 x 30 x 20 mm, was in the right nasal cavity and had a necrotic surface. We removed the tumor through endonasal endoscopic surgery. The tumor had spindle-shaped cells and was positive for cytokeratin, (AE1/AE3), vimentin, S-100beta, and MIB-1 but was negative for CD34, desmin, neuron-specific enolase, and synaptophysin. Slight immunoreactivity for smooth muscle actin was noted in some tumor cells. There has been no evidence of tumor recurrence in the 18 months following surgery.",cancer
"The impact of videorecording on the quality of colonoscopy performance: a pilot study. OBJECTIVES: Colonoscopy provides imperfect protection against colorectal cancer and is operator dependent. Colonoscopies typically are poorly documented. We aimed to determine whether videorecording impacts short-term performance of colonoscopy. METHODS: We videorecorded routine colonoscopies by seven colonoscopists, with and without their awareness. Colonoscopy quality was measured by blinded assessment of inspection time and technique. RESULTS: From pre- to post-awareness of videorecording, mean inspection time increased by 49% for all colonoscopies combined and increased significantly for four individual colonoscopists. The overall quality of mucosal inspection technique improved by 31% after awareness of videorecording. CONCLUSIONS: Awareness of videorecording improved physician performance of colonoscopy. Further investigation of the role of videorecording in achieving sustained improvements in the quality performance of colonoscopy, including increases in adenoma detection, is warranted.",cancer
"Thyrotoxicosis with pegylated interferon alfa-2b. BACKGROUND: Despite adequate surgery, a diagnosis of stage III melanoma carries a high risk of relapse, and hence mortality. Interferon alfa is the only treatment that has currently been shown to alter the natural history of the disease, delaying relapse-free survival, particularly in patients with micrometastatic disease. There is also recent evidence of a prognostic advantage conferred by the development of autoimmune conditions in patients receiving adjuvant interferon therapy. OBSERVATIONS: We present the case of a 27-year-old woman with stage IIIa melanoma who was entered into the European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer 18991 trial of 5-year adjuvant treatment with pegylated interferon (peginterferon) alfa-2b. The patient developed thyrotoxicosis 3 months after commencing treatment, which required treatment with propylthiouracil. The degree of thyrotoxicosis corresponded closely to the dose of peginterferon alfa-2b given. However, in this patient, the hyperthyroidism resolved spontaneously after 4 years when peginterferon treatment was still ongoing. Seven years following the initial diagnosis, the patient has not had disease relapse. CONCLUSION: Hyperthyroidism is less common than hypothyroidism as a consequence of interferon therapy, and this case is atypical in that it resolved spontaneously during interferon therapy but is in accordance with the recent evidence of a positive association between interferon-associated autoimmunity and prognosis.",cancer
"Structure and control of the actin regulatory WAVE complex. Members of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) family control cytoskeletal dynamics by promoting actin filament nucleation with the Arp2/3 complex. The WASP relative WAVE regulates lamellipodia formation within a 400-kilodalton, hetero-pentameric WAVE regulatory complex (WRC). The WRC is inactive towards the Arp2/3 complex, but can be stimulated by the Rac GTPase, kinases and phosphatidylinositols. Here we report the 2.3-angstrom crystal structure of the WRC and complementary mechanistic analyses. The structure shows that the activity-bearing VCA motif of WAVE is sequestered by a combination of intramolecular and intermolecular contacts within the WRC. Rac and kinases appear to destabilize a WRC element that is necessary for VCA sequestration, suggesting the way in which these signals stimulate WRC activity towards the Arp2/3 complex. The spatial proximity of the Rac binding site and the large basic surface of the WRC suggests how the GTPase and phospholipids could cooperatively recruit the complex to membranes.",nocancer
"A steady rise in incidence of pertussis since nineties in the Czech Republic. STUDY OBJECTIVE: The objective was to analyze the incidence and trends of pertussis in the Czech Republic, particularly by age groups. An important part of the analysis was the immunization coverage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The incidence data were obtained from the following information sources: archives of the National Institute of Public Health for the period up to 1964, archives of the Institute of Health Information and Statistics for 1965-1981, Communicable Disease Information System for 1982-1992 and Communicable Disease Notification System EPIDAT for 1992-2008. The mortality data were obtained, apart from the aforementioned sources, also from the literature. The case definition was based on that provided by the Bulletin of the Ministry of Health and the EC Directive. Cases were notified in accordance with the guidelines of the respective information systems and the principles of pertussis surveillance laid down by the regulations. An epidemiological investigation form was filled in for each case of pertussis, indicating the type of laboratory analysis. The methods used for laboratory diagnosis of pertussis were culture, serology and a PCR assay. RESULTS: An upward trend in notified cases of pertussis has been observed since the 1990s. The highest annual number of cases (767) in the last 42 years was notified in 2008 (7.3/100,000 population). In 1988-2008, most (93.1%) cases were notified in patients aged 0-19 years. During this period the peak moved from the youngest and preschool age groups toward younger and older school age children (the highest age-specific incidence of pertussis, i.e., 79.8/100,000, was observed in 10-14-year-olds. In 2008, a 3.4 fold rise in pertussis cases was observed in 15-19-year-olds as compared with the rates in the last six years. More cases were also notified in the age groups of potential parents and grandparents. In the 0- year-old children, the incidence of pertussis was decreasing since the 1950s (3804.9/100,000 in 1956) to remain under 10.0/100,000 between 1974 and 1999. It showed a continuing upward trend from 3.8/100,000 in 1987 to 26.7/100,000 in 2008, even with three deaths notified, after 35 years, in 2005, 2007 and 2009. CONCLUSION: Despite the high immunization coverage with pertussis vaccine (>97%), the pertussis incidence is rising in the Czech Republic. An upward trend in pertussis cases has been observed since 1993, peaking in 2008. More than 75 % of pertussis cases were notified in patients who had been vaccinated with 5 doses of pertussis vaccine before infection. During the period 1988-2008, the highest age-specific incidence, i.e., 79.8/100,000, was observed in 10-14-year-olds. After 35 years, three deaths from pertussis were notified in 2005, 2007 and 2009. All three fatal cases occurred in unvaccinated children under one year of age. The focus needs to be on active surveillance of pertussis and quality improvement of all its parts.",nocancer

"Bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin for advanced ovarian cancer: low risk of gastrointestinal and cardiovascular toxicity. The purpose of this preliminary study was to retrospectively assess the incidence of bowel perforation and hypertension in two separate advanced ovarian cancer patient populations following first-line therapy, comprising paclitaxel, carboplatin and bevacizumab. The first 20 patients were treated with six cycles of paclitaxel (175 mg/m2), carboplatin (AUC of 5 i.v.), and bevacizumab (15 mg/kg of body weight); q21 days per an independent protocol. The subsequent patients (n = 12) were administered weekly paclitaxel (80 mg/m2), carboplatin (AUC of 5 i.v.) every four weeks, and bevacizumab (10 mg/kg of body weight) every two weeks for six cycles according to a separate, independent protocol. Bevacizumab was not added to either chemotherapy regimen until cycle 2. In both groups patients who achieved a complete response, partial response or stable disease at the conclusion of induction therapy received bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) and paclitaxel (135 mg/m2) q21 days as maintenance therapy. A total of 170 cycles (median = 6; range 3-6) of primary induction chemotherapy, 140 of which contained bevacizumab, were administered. Moreover, 206 cycles (median = 9; range 1-12) of maintenance chemotherapy have been delivered to 28 patients thus far. There was no incidence of GI perforation and only two patients demonstrated clinically significant hypertension. Previous studies involving bevacizumab have raised concerns regarding bowel perforations and hypertension. However, we did not encounter difficulties with either of these complications. While we recognize that the risk for bowel perforation remains in the 5-11% range, the study's preliminary results suggest that first-line treatment of advanced stage ovarian carcinoma with bevacizumab can be safely administered.",cancer
"Microarray analysis of gene expression patterns in human proximal tubule cells over a short and long time course of cadmium exposure. Numerous studies showed that renal proximal tubules cells are the cell type critically affected by chronic exposure to cadmium (Cd(2+)). The aim of the present study was to apply global gene expression technology and a human renal epithelial cell culture model (HPT) to determine whether time of exposure to Cd(2+) exerts a major influence on the resulting pattern of global gene expression. HPT cells were exposed to Cd(2+) for a short, 1-d, period of exposure (9, 27, and 45 muM) versus a longer, 13-d, period (4.5, 9, and 27 muM), with the hypothesis being that the stress response of the cells would be more active during the short time of exposure. The results showed that the differential expression of genes was very extensive for HPT cells exposed to Cd(2+) for 1 d, with more than 1848 genes displaying alterations compared to control and with the major categories of genes being involved in stress responses; cell death; checkpoint arrest, DNA repair, and the cell cycle; inflammatory responses; and cell adhesion, motion and differentiation. In contrast, HPT cells exposed to Cd(2+) for 13 d showed 923 genes to be differentially expressed, with a marked reduction in the number of differentially expressed stress response genes and a significant increase in the number of genes involved in development and differentiation. There were 387 differentially expressed genes common to both times of exposure. Data suggest that unless one is actively seeking to study the acute stress response, global gene expression technology should not be applied within an early time course of toxicant exposure.",nocancer
"Emergency department seizure epidemiology. Although only 3% of people in the United States are diagnosed with epilepsy, 11% will have at least one seizure during their lifetime. Seizures account for about 1% of all emergency department (ED) visits, and about 2% of visits to children's hospital EDs. Seizure accounts for about 3% of prehospital transports. In adult ED patients, common causes of seizure are alcoholism, stroke, tumor, trauma, and central nervous system infection. In children, febrile seizures are most common. In infants younger than 6 months, hyponatremia and infection are important considerations. Epilepsy is an uncommon cause of seizures in the ED, accounting for a minority of seizure-related visits. Of ED patients with seizure, about 7% have status epilepticus, which has an age-dependent mortality averaging 22%.",nocancer

RESULTS: Inverted papillomas are the most common tumour managed endoscopically (57% of all sinonasal tumours) with 76 patients seen over the last 8 years. Approximately 50% of these cases had undergone previous surgery in another centre where the tumour was either not recognized or the resection was incomplete. Twentynine percent of these patients had a recurrence but only three required a revision procedure using an open approach; otherwise recurrences were successfully managed endoscopically. Endoscopic recurrence during the first half was 32% (versus 14% for open procedures), dropping to a recurrence rate of 11% in the latter period. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic management of inverted papillomas allows good control of the disease and avoids unnecessary morbidity associated with open procedures. Although there is a higher initial recurrence rate, these recurrences can be successfully managed endoscopically, and computer navigation can be a useful adjunct in achieving this.",cancer
"Neuroendoscopic treatment of arachnoid cysts of the quadrigeminal cistern: a series of 14 cases. OBJECT: In this paper, the authors' goal was to evaluate the role of neuroendoscopy in the treatment of arachnoid cysts of the quadrigeminal cistern. METHODS: Between March 1995 and February 2008, 14 patients affected by arachnoid cysts of the quadrigeminal cistern were treated endoscopically. The cysts were classified according to their anatomical and radiological appearance. The most frequent form (Type I) extended infratentorially and supratentorially with a dumbbell shape. Type II cysts were confined to the infratentorial space and were associated with the most severe and acute form of hydrocephalus. Type III cysts presented a significant asymmetric expansion toward the temporal fossa. Ten patients underwent an endoscopic procedure as primary treatment and 4 as an alternative to shunt revision. In 6 cases, the first endoscopic procedure was ventriculocystostomy (VC) together with endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV). In the other 8 cases, the first endoscopic procedure was VC alone. RESULTS: In the 6 cases in which VC was performed with an ETV, the procedure was successful, and the patients did not require further surgery. Of the 8 cases in which the first endoscopic procedure performed was VC without ETV, 7 underwent reoperation. Four of these patients underwent endoscopic procedures (by reopening the obstructed VC and performing ETV or cystocisternostomy) 2, 4, 4, and 5 months later with final success in all cases. Three patients (all of whom were previously treated using ventriculo- or cystoperitoneal shunts) required shunt reimplantation (complete failure). Subdural collection developed in 1 case, which was managed by transient insertion of a subduroperitoneal shunt. Neurological and developmental outcomes were good except for 1 patient who did not show improvement in preoperative developmental delay. No transient or permanent morbidity or mortality was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of this series suggests that arachnoid cysts of the quadrigeminal cistern and the associated hydrocephalus can be effectively treated by endoscopy; this approach allows the patient to be shunt independent in more than 78% of the cases. If endoscopy is used as first option, the success rate of endoscopic procedures observed in this series was 90%. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy should be associated with a VC to offer the highest success rate with a single procedure.",cancer
"Osteochondroma of the coccyx: a case report. Osteochondroma is the most common benign bone tumor. Majority of solitary osteochondromas are asymptomatic however, may give functional impairment due to pain from pressure or mass effect. Osteochondromas occur most often about the knee and picked incidentally, coccygeal osteochondroma however; is a rare occurrence. On a plain radiography, it typically appears as a bony projection with a clear cortex and medulla related to the coccyx. Here we present the case of a 7-year-old child with coccygeal osteochondroma.",cancer
"Childhood leukemia incidence in Brazil according to different geographical regions. BACKGROUND: Resource-rich countries tend to have a higher incidence of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), whereas lower rates are seen in more deprived countries. This study describes the incidence of childhood acute leukemia in Brazil, an upper middle-income country, based on data from 16 population-based cancer registries (PBCRs). PROCEDURE: Data were examined from 16 PBCRs in Brazilian cities located in five geographical regions during the period from 1997 to 2004. Incidence rates were analyzed according to gender, age, and type of leukemia. The Wilcoxon test was performed to evaluate for gender-age based difference between by leukemia type. RESULTS: The median age-adjusted incidence rate (AAIR) of leukemia in children aged 0-14 years old was 53.3 per million. A different AAIR was found regarding ALL and myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) that ranged from 24.8 to 76.84 per 1,000,000 children. Manaus, although located in a poor area of Brazil, exhibited the highest AAIR (56.6 per million) of ALL. Goiania had the highest AAIR (24.5 per million) of MPD. The median age-specific incidence rate (ASIR) for the 16 Brazilian PBCRs demonstrated a marked peak in incidence of ALL at age 3 years old, in both genders. CONCLUSIONS: This population-based study of childhood leukemia demonstrates that substantial regional differences exist regarding the incidence of acute leukemia in Brazil, which warrants further ecological study.",cancer
"Transformation of follicular lymphoma to plasmablastic lymphoma with c-myc gene rearrangement. Follicular lymphoma (FL) is an indolent lymphoma that transforms to high-grade lymphoma, mostly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, in about a third of patients. We present the first report of a case of FL that transformed to plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL). Clonal transformation of the FL to PBL was evidenced by identical IGH/BCL2 gene rearrangements and VDJ gene usage in rearranged IGH genes. IGH/ BCL2 translocation was retained in the PBL, which also acquired c-myc gene rearrangement. Genealogic analysis based on somatic hypermutation of the rearranged IGH genes of both FL and PBL suggests that transformation of the FL to PBL occurred most likely by divergent evolution from a common progenitor cell rather than direct evolution from the FL clone. Our study of this unusual case expands the histologic spectrum of FL transformation and increases our understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms of transformation of indolent lymphomas to aggressive lymphomas.",cancer
"Scanning electron microscopic and X-ray micro analysis on tooth enamel exposed to alkaline agents. The background of this study comprises two clinical cases, where patients exposed to aerosols of an alkaline and surface active cleaning agent developed loss of enamel substance on their teeth, further resulting in loss of teeth and partially destroyed soft tissues. The alkaline cleaning agent consisted of potassium hydroxide and various surfactants. The purpose of this study was to investigate possible changes in morphology and composition in human teeth enamel exposed to alkaline solutions, by means of X-ray micro analysis (XRMA), FTIR-spectroscopic analyses and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Extracted premolars, exposed to potassium hydroxide solutions and alkaline cleaning solution,were analyzed by means of XRMA and SEM. Enamel powder, exposed to cleaning solution, was analyzed by means of FTIR. The SEM analysis revealed an increased porosity of the enamel surface and partially loss of enamel substance after exposure to alkaline solutions. The XRMA analyses revealed a decrease in carbon concentration while phosphorous and calcium showed no marked changes. The FTIR analyses showed no significant changes in peak heights or peak positions for phosphate, carbonate or hydroxide. It was concluded that human teeth enamel exposed to alkaline solutions showed loss of organic substance, marked pores in enamel surface and loss of substance in the enamel surface.",nocancer
"Improved results of primary total hip replacement. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Over the past 20 years, several changes in treatment policy and treatment options have taken place regarding hip replacement. For this reason, we wanted to investigate the results after hip replacement in terms of revision rate, during a 21-year period among hip replacements reported to the Norwegian Arthroplasty Register. METHODS: 110,882 primary total hip replacements were reported to the Norwegian Arthroplasty Register from 1987 through 2007. Risk of revision during the time periods 1993-1997, 1998-2002, and 2003-2007 was compared to that of the reference period 1987-1992. Adjusted Cox regression analyses were performed to compare the risk of revision in different time periods and extended analyses were done to investigate revision within the first postoperative year and after the first year. RESULTS: There was an overall reduced risk of revision in the time periods 1993-1997, 1998-2002, and 2003-2007 compared to the reference period: RR = 0.81 (95% CI 0.77-0.86), 0.51 (CI 0.47-0.55), and 0.77 (CI 0.68-0.85), respectively. The improved results were due to a marked reduction in aseptic loosening of the femoral and acetabular components in all time periods and in all subgroups of prostheses. A change in the timing of revision took place, with more early revisions and fewer late revisions in the later time periods. Revision due to dislocation and infection increased over time. INTERPRETATION: The risk of revision decreased during the study period, due to fewer cases of aseptic loosening of prosthetic components. The best results were obtained with the use of cemented prostheses. Prevention of dislocation and infection should be a major goal in the future, as revision due to these causes increased during the study period.",nocancer
"Thymic Hassall's bodies of children with congenital heart defects. The development of the thymus and heart are closely related while in both, the neural crest cells play an important role. In our preliminary study, the thymic microscopic structures of the infant's thymuses with the congenital heart defects were observed. The study was conducted on 36 specimens of newborn thymuses removed due to surgery for cardiovascular malformations. Standard formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue technique was used. Five-microm-thick sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and the microscopic examination was focused on the structure of Hassall's bodies. The Hassall's bodies showed considerable variations in size as well as in quantity. In most cases, the Hassall's bodies were large with the heterogeneous amorphous material enclosed in cystic dilatations. This type of Hassall's bodies is typical for adult thymuses. The most conspicuous changes (huge Hassall's bodies with the cystic dilatation filled up with cell detritus) were observed in patients with ventricular septal defect, atrioventricular septal defect and tetralogy of Fallot. Small-sized Hassall's bodies corresponding with infant age, were observed in cases with pulmonary valve atresia, atrial septal defect and in some cases of transposition of great arteries. We assume that the changes of microenvironment of the thymic medulla are associated with disrupted migration of the neural crest cells which are essential in the normogenesis of both heart and thymus (Tab. 1, Fig. 12, Ref. 33).",nocancer
"Influence of pre-analytical conditions on plasma ribavirin concentrations. Ribavirin (CAS 66510-90-5) associated to peginterferon (CAS 99210-65-8) is the current standard treatment for chronic hepatitis C. Exposure to ribavirin influences the virological response and anemia. Therefore monitoring plasma concentration of ribavirin is a useful tool for individualizing ribavirin dosing regimens. Ribavirin is a substrate of several nucleoside transporters that play a role in its distribution in erythrocytes. After blood sampling, it is essential to limit this mechanism. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of temperature and time on ribavirin plasma concentrations. Two blood samples, collected in EDTA tubes, were taken at the same time from 23 patients. One sample was conserved on ice whereas the second one was kept at room temperature during transport to the laboratory. Upon receipt at the laboratory and at different times post-reception (from 1 to 3 h), 1.5 mL of blood from each sample was centrifuged to obtain plasma that was then stored at -20 degrees C until assay. Samples were maintained in the same conditions as during transport for the 3 h. Plasma ribavirin was analysed using an HPLC-UV system. The results showed that mean loss of ribavirin concentration, for samples kept on ice as well as at room temperature, was less than 3%, 9% and 13% after 1, 2 and 3 h, respectively. These results suggest that blood samples for ribavirin analysis can be sent at room temperature within a period of 2 h between sampling and centrifugation.",nocancer
"Strategies for subacute/chronic type B aortic dissection: the Investigation Of Stent Grafts in Patients with type B Aortic Dissection (INSTEAD) trial 1-year outcome. OBJECTIVE: Endovascular stent grafting represents a novel concept for type B aortic dissection both in the acute and subacute/chronic setting, with an unknown effect on outcomes. METHODS: In a prospective trial 140 patients with stable type B dissection were randomly subjected to elective stent-graft placement in addition to optimal medical therapy (n = 72) or to optimal medical therapy (n = 68) with surveillance (arterial pressure according to World Health Organization guidelines </= 120/80 mm Hg). The primary end point was 1-year all-cause mortality, whereas aorta-related mortality, progression (with need for conversion or additional endovascular or open surgical intervention), and aortic remodeling were secondary end points. RESULTS: There was no difference in all-cause mortality: cumulative survival was 97.0% +/- 3.4% with optimal medical therapy versus 91.3% +/- 2.1% with thoracic endovascular aortic repair (P = .16). Moreover, aorta-related mortality was not different (P = .42), and the risk for the combined end point of aorta-related death (rupture) and progression (including conversion or additional endovascular or open surgical intervention) was similar (P = .86). Three neurologic adverse events occurred in the thoracic endovascular aortic repair group (1 paraplegia, 1 stroke, and 1 transient paraparesis) versus 1 episode of paraparesis with medical treatment. Finally, aortic remodeling (with true-lumen recovery and thoracic false-lumen thrombosis) occurred in 91.3% with thoracic endovascular aortic repair versus 19.4% with medical treatment (P < .001), which is suggestive of continued remodeling. CONCLUSIONS: In survivors of uncomplicated type B aortic dissection, elective stent-graft placement does not improve 1-year survival and adverse events, despite favorable aortic remodeling.",nocancer
"Her-2/neu expression in testicular cancer--a retrospective analysis in 57 cases. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate her-2/neu expression in testicular germ cell tumors (GCT). METHODS: In patients with primary GCT her-2/neu expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Furthermore, gene amplification was analyzed by chromogene in situ hybridization (CISH). For interpretation, the most recent Asco Guidelines were used. RESULTS: The expression patterns were analyzed according to the histologic subtype. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated a weak (score 1) to moderate expression (score 2) in 1% of GCT; none of the GCT revealed a score 3 expression profile. By CISH analysis, we did not observe any gene amplification in the 57 GCT. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of her-2/neu expression in primary testicular cancer is of no therapeutic relevance. However, for the future we will explore the expression of her-2/neu in residual masses after chemotherapy to assess the role of targeted therapy in chemoresistant metastases.",cancer
"Granulosa cell tumor and endometrial cancer: a case report and review of the literature. Granulosa cell tumors (GCTs) of the ovary are an uncommon type of ovarian cancer, representing only 2-5%. Frequently, their tumoral cells present some features of normal granulosa cells, like hormonal production. As a consequence, this neoplasia can be diagnosed either by common ovarian cancer symptoms or endometrial pathologies due to an estrogenic effect. Symptoms caused by estrogen production can also give rise to different clinical manifestations depending on whether they appear in postmenopausal or young women. In the case we present below, a patient was referred for presenting postmenopausal bleeding of one year's duration. Once endometrial cancer was diagnosed and subsequently staged, an ovarian mass was detected. We report an atypical case of ovarian cancer with the aim of reviewing the clinical features of GCT, as well as its prognosis, treatment and follow-up recommendations, according to the available literature.",cancer
"Improving assessment in dental education through a paradigm of comprehensive care: a case report. The assessment of clinical competence in health disciplines is a critical issue. Universities have a responsibility to graduate students who can demonstrate fitness to practice because clinical competence relates directly to the quality of patients' care-the quality of their treatment, their health outcomes, and their experience. In respect of the last of these, this article argues that the nature of what we term ""clinical competence"" ought to recognize the patient before the medical/dental condition or clinical intervention and, in order to achieve this, dental education should adopt learning, teaching, and assessment strategies that develop integrated learning outcomes consistent with a paradigm of comprehensive care. The article describes the ways in which this paradigm has been operationalized in the learning, teaching, and assessment strategies at Griffith University in Australia. It places a particular focus upon the assessment methods used in the Bachelor of Oral Health program. In this way, the article aims to illustrate ways that the quality of the assessment of clinical competence can, and should, be improved. While this is a work in progress, this description may be useful for educators at other academic dental institutions who wish to adopt, adapt, and develop similar approaches.",nocancer
"An evaluation of U.S. Navy Dental Corps classification guidelines. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this research were to evaluate the effectiveness of two different sets of dental classification guidelines to differentiate dental emergency (DE) rates between deployable and nondeployable personnel. METHODS: A retrospective study of the dental records of two cohorts of Marine Corps recruits examined and treated using different classification guidelines was completed. RESULTS: Both classification systems showed significant differences between DE rates of nondeployable and deployable personnel. No statistical difference was observed when comparing the adjusted HRs of the two cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study suggest that both guidelines are able to distinguish between deployable and nondeployable personnel and give reasonable assurance that class 1 and 2 patients will not experience a DE for a 6-month period. Incorporating factors such as caries risk, number of missing and filled teeth, and number of third molars may improve the ability of the dental classification systems in predicting DE.",nocancer
"Does the southern European cardiovascular mortality advantage extend to total mortality? 50-year trends in death risks between 40 and 70 years of age in Western European men and women. AIMS: To study 50-year mortality trends in men and women of northern and southern Western Europe. METHODS: The World Health Organization mortality data base and multiple decrement life table methods was used to compute all-cause and cause-specific risks of middle-age death (40-69 years of age) for northern (Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and UK) and southern (France, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland) Western European countries. RESULTS: From 1952 to 2001, the risk of a cardiovascular death in middle age was higher in the north compared to the south. The north/ south cardiovascular mortality ratios (MR) peaked in 1990-1993 and were 1.57 among women and 1.47 among men in 2001. In 1952, the all-cause risks of middle-age death were similar in the north and south for both women and men (39% and 27%, respectively). In 2001, middle-age death risks were similar for men in the north and the south (24% and 23%, MR = 1.05), but higher among women in the north compared to the south (14% and 11%, MR = 1.28). Cause-specific death risks demonstrated that the cardiovascular advantage for southern European men was countered by a disadvantage in cancer death risk (2001 north/south cancer MR = 0.85). For northern European women in 2001, there was a disadvantage also in the other major cause-of-death groups: cancer (MR = 1.22) and other diseases (MR = 1.28). CONCLUSIONS: The southern European cardiovascular middle-age mortality advantage extended to total mortality much more for women than for men. We suggest that forces behind this gender difference in this north/south mortality gradient include life style factors.",cancer
"Carcinoid tumors of the rectum: a multi-institutional international collaboration. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe recent experience with rectal carcinoids in European and North American centers. BACKGROUND: While considered indolent, the propensity of carcinoids to metastasize can be significant. METHODS: Rectal carcinoid patients were identified from prospective databases maintained at 9 institutions between 1999 and 2008. Demographic, clinical, and histologic data were collated. Median follow-up was 5 years (range, 0.5-10 years). RESULTS: Two hundred two patients were identified. The median age was 55 years (range, 31-81 years). The majority of tumors were an incidental finding (n = 115, 56.9%). The median tumor size was 10 mm (range, 2-120 mm). Overall, 93 (49%) tumors were limited to the mucosa or submucosa, 45 (24%) involved the muscularis propria, 29 (15%) extended into the perirectal fat, and 6 (3%) reached the visceral peritoneum. The primary treatment modalities were endoscopic resection (n = 86, 43%) and surgical extirpation (n = 102, 50%). Forty-one patients (40%) underwent a high anterior resection, whereas 45 (44%) underwent anterior resection with total mesorectal excision. Seven patients (7%) underwent Hartman's procedure, 7 (7%) underwent abdomino-perineal resection, and 6 (6%) had transanal endoscopic microsurgery, whereas 4 (4%) patients underwent a transanal excision. Multiple variable logistic regression analysis demonstrated that tumor size greater than 10 mm and lymphovascular invasion were predictors of nodal involvement (P = 0.006 and < 0.001, respectively), whereas the presence of lymph node metastases and lymphovascular invasion was associated with subsequent development of distant metastases (P = 0.033 and 0.022, respectively). The presence of nodal metastases has a profound effect upon survival, with a 5-year survival rate of 70%, and 10-year survival of 60% for node positive tumors. Patients with distant metastases have a 4-year survival of 38%. CONCLUSION: Tumor size greater than 10 mm and lymphovascular invasion are significantly associated with the presence of nodal disease, rendering mesorectal excision advisable. Transanal excision is adequate for smaller tumors.",cancer
"Reprogramming cellular behavior with RNA controllers responsive to endogenous proteins. Synthetic genetic devices that interface with native cellular pathways can be used to change natural networks to implement new forms of control and behavior. The engineering of gene networks has been limited by an inability to interface with native components. We describe a class of RNA control devices that overcome these limitations by coupling increased abundance of particular proteins to targeted gene expression events through the regulation of alternative RNA splicing. We engineered RNA devices that detect signaling through the nuclear factor kappaB and Wnt signaling pathways in human cells and rewire these pathways to produce new behaviors, thereby linking disease markers to noninvasive sensing and reprogrammed cellular fates. Our work provides a genetic platform that can build programmable sensing-actuation devices enabling autonomous control over cellular behavior.",nocancer
"Biofilm development by clinical isolates of Staphylococcus spp. from retrieved orthopedic prostheses. BACKGROUND: Biofilms are considered the key factor in the development of implant-related infections. However, only a few reports have dealt with the ability of organisms isolated from such infections to develop biofilms in vitro. METHODS: We evaluated different phenotypic techniques (2 microtiter plate assays and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and genotypic techniques (detection of the ica operon) related to biofilm development by clinical isolates of Staphylococcus spp. RESULTS: All 26 strains tested (from 23 specimens) were biofilm producers. Stepanovic test detected biofilm formation in 85% of the strains, microtiter plate assay in 65%, and CLSM in 39%. The ica operon was detected in 73% of all strains (all 13 S. aureus strains and 6 of the 13 coagulase-negative Staphylococcus strains). 7 ica-negative strains were biofilm-positive by phenotypic methods. INTERPRETATION: The detection of ica genes could not be related to the phenotypic ability of the strains to develop a biofilm in vitro, so both studies (genetic and phenotypic) are required for a better evaluation of the biofilm-producing ability of clinical strains of Staphylococcus isolated from orthopedic infections.",nocancer
"Preparation and characterization of different sizes of ethosomes encapsulated with 5-fluorouracil and its experimental study of permeability in hypertrophic scar. With the aim of investigating scar penetration efficiency of different sizes of ethosomes encapsulated with Fluorouracil, three kinds of ethosomes with different sizes were prepared by extruding the vesicles through polycarbonate membrane filters, their encapsulation efficiency of Fluorouracil (5-FU) were investigated by dialysis method, their scar-penetration efficiencies were analyzed by filling Rodanmin 6GO into ethosomes and using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The prepared ethosomes were 216 +/- 19 nm, 107 +/- 13 nm, and 65 +/- 10 nm in diameter respectively, and exhibited good dispersibility. Their encapsulation efficiency of 5-FU were 12%, 34%, and 41%, respectively. The results indicated that the 5-FU penetration was reversely related to the size of the size of the ethosomes. The ethosomes of 65 nm in diameter exhibited maximal fluorescence penetration efficiency which could reach the deep layer of dermis of hypertrophic scar. In conclusion, three different sizes of 5-FU ethosomes were prepared successfully, the ethosomes of 65 nm in diameter with 5-FU can penetrate scar high efficiently, which has potential in application such as anti-scar drug carriers in scar therapy in near future.",nocancer
"Spectrum and prevalence of FP/TMEM127 gene mutations in pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas. CONTEXT: Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are genetically heterogeneous neural crest-derived neoplasms. We recently identified germline mutations of the novel transmembrane-encoding gene FP/TMEM127 in familial and sporadic pheochromocytomas consistent with a tumor suppressor effect. OBJECTIVES: To examine the prevalence and spectrum of FP/TMEM127 mutations in pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas and to test the effect of mutations in vitro. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We sequenced the FP/TMEM127 gene in 990 individuals with pheochromocytomas and/or paragangliomas, including 898 previously unreported cases without mutations in other susceptibility genes from 8 independent worldwide referral centers between January 2009 and June 2010. A multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based method was developed to screen for large gene deletions in 545 of these samples. Confocal microscopy of 5 transfected mutant proteins was used to determine their subcellular localization. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The frequency and type of FP/TMEM127 mutation or deletion was assessed and correlated with clinical variables; the subcellular localization of 5 overexpressed mutants was compared with wild-type FP/TMEM127 protein. RESULTS: We identified 19 potentially pathogenic FP/TMEM127 germline mutations in 20 independent families, but no large deletions were detected. All mutation carriers had adrenal tumors, including 7 bilateral (P = 2.7 x 10(-4)) and/or with familial disease (5 of 20 samples; P = .005). The median age at disease onset in the FP/TMEM127 mutation group was similar to that of patients without a mutation (41.5 vs 45 years, respectively; P = .54). The most common presentation was that of a single benign adrenal tumor in patients older than 40 years. Malignancy was seen in 1 mutation carrier (5%). Expression of 5 novel FP/TMEM127 mutations in cell lines revealed diffuse localization of the mutant proteins in contrast with the discrete multiorganelle distribution of wild-type TMEM127. CONCLUSIONS: Germline mutations of FP/TMEM127 were associated with pheochromocytoma but not paraganglioma and occurred in an age group frequently excluded from genetic screening algorithms. Disease-associated mutations disrupt intracellular distribution of the FP/TMEM127 protein.",cancer
"Remission of type 2 diabetes after gastric bypass and banding: mechanisms and 2 year outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the rate of type 2 diabetes remission after gastric bypass and banding and establish the mechanism leading to remission of type 2 diabetes after bariatric surgery. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Glycemic control in type 2 diabetic patients is improved after bariatric surgery. METHODS: In study 1, 34 obese type 2 diabetic patients undergoing either gastric bypass or gastric banding were followed up for 36 months. Remission of diabetes was defined as patients not requiring hypoglycemic medication, fasting glucose below 7 mmol/L, 2 hour glucose after oral glucose tolerance test below 11.1 mmol/L, and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) <6%. In study 2, 41 obese type 2 diabetic patients undergoing either bypass, banding, or very low calorie diet were followed up for 42 days. Insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), insulin production, and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) responses after a standard meal were measured. RESULTS: In study 1, HbA1c as a marker of glycemic control improved by 2.9% after gastric bypass and 1.9% after gastric banding at latest follow-up (P < 0.001 for both groups). Despite similar weight loss, 72% (16/22) of bypass and 17% (2/12) of banding patients (P = 0.001) fulfilled the definition of remission at latest follow-up. In study 2, within days, only bypass patients had improved insulin resistance, insulin production, and GLP-1 responses (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: With gastric bypass, type 2 diabetes can be improved and even rapidly put into a state of remission irrespective of weight loss. Improved insulin resistance within the first week after surgery remains unexplained, but increased insulin production in the first week after surgery may be explained by the enhanced postprandial GLP-1 responses.",nocancer
"Adverse health outcomes among cosmetologists and noncosmetologists in the Reproductive Outcomes of Salon Employees (ROSE) study. The purpose of this study was to examine adverse health outcomes, including those related to cardiovascular and skin health as well as respiratory functions, among cosmetologists aged 21 to 55 yr and to compare data to women of the same age working in other occupations. Self-reported data were analyzed from 450 cosmetologists and 511 women in other occupations who participated in the Reproductive Outcomes of Salon Employees (ROSE) study in Maryland. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were computed using logistic regression to examine the associations between cosmetologist occupation and each adverse health outcome adjusted for age, education, and smoking status. Cosmetologists were at significantly increased risk of depression compared to noncosmetologists after adjustment for age, education, and smoking status (OR 1.49; 95% CI 1.10, 2.00). There were no statistically significant associations between cosmetology occupation and the other adverse health outcomes, including those related to allergies and skin disorders, in both the unadjusted and adjusted analyses. Cosmetologists may be exposed to chemicals in the salon that lead to depression. Future study needs to be conducted to examine specific chemical exposures in the salon. This will help to provide information required for the development of best occupational safety practices among salon workers.",nocancer
"Surgery for papillary thyroid carcinoma: is lobectomy enough? OBJECTIVE: To further understanding of treatment of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). DESIGN: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program database was searched for patients who had undergone surgery for PTC. SETTING: Areas covered by Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results population-based registries. PATIENTS: Patients who had undergone PTC surgery between January 1, 1988, and December 31, 2001, were included in the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Of the total 22,724 patients with PTC, 5964 patients underwent lobectomy. There were 2138 total and 471 disease-specific deaths. Controlling for tumor size, multivariate analysis revealed no survival difference between patients who had undergone total thyroidectomy and those who had undergone lobectomy. Increased tumor size, extrathyroidal extent, positive nodal status, and increased age displayed significantly worse DSS and OS (P < .001). Histologically, follicular PTC subtype did not affect DSS or OS. Patients who had received radioactive iodine had poorer DSS but improved OS. Patients undergoing external beam radiation therapy had poor DSS (hazard ratio, 4.48; 95% confidence interval, 3.30-6.06; P < .001) and OS (1.71; 1.42-2.07; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study compel us to reinvestigate the current PTC surgical recommendations of total thyroidectomy based on tumor size because this may not affect survival across all populations. In addition, the current use of external beam radiation therapy for the treatment of PTC should be reexamined.",cancer
"Trends in oral health by poverty status as measured by Healthy People 2010 objectives.

We assessed recent trends for six HP 2010 oral health objectives by poverty status. METHODS: We used data from the 1988-1994 and 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys to analyze trends for HP 2010 age-specific objectives relating to caries experience, untreated tooth decay, dental sealants, periodontal disease, tooth retention, and complete tooth loss by poverty status. RESULTS: Dental caries significantly increased from 19% to 24% for children aged 2-4 years, but when stratified by poverty, caries only increased significantly for non-poor 2- to 4-year-old children (10% to 15%) (Objective 21-1a). The largest percentage point increase in dental caries was for non-poor boys (9% to 18%). The use of dental sealants continues to grow in the U.S. The largest percentage point increase in sealant use (Objective 21-8) between the two survey periods was for all poor children aged 8 years (3% to 21%). Among adults aged 35-44 years, periodontal disease significantly declined in the U.S. from 22% to 16% (Objective 21-5b) and more adults retained all of their natural teeth (30% to 38%) (Objective 21-3). However, the increase in tooth retention was significant only for non-poor adults, particularly non-poor men (34% to 48%). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the oral health status of Americans as measured by HP 2010 objectives mostly showed improvement or remained unchanged between 1998-1994 and 1999-2004. However, some changes in oral health status for some traditionally low-risk groups, such as non-poor children, may be reversing improvements in oral health that have consistently been observed in previous decades. These results suggest that poverty status is an important factor for planning and monitoring future national oral health goals.",nocancer
"Concurrent validity and reliability of the maximum step length test in older adults. PURPOSE: This study assessed concurrent validity of the Maximum Step Length (MSL) test as a measure of falls risk and balance-impairment for community-dwelling older adults. A secondary purpose was to determine intra- and interrater reliability and standard error of measurement of the MSL test. METHODS: Thirty-five community-dwelling adults aged 60 or older provided a 12-month falls history. Functional measures included the MSL test, Single Limb Stance Time, Functional Reach test, Timed Up and Go test, and a test of trunk position sense. Pearson correlation coefficient, intraclass correlation coefficient (a coefficient of relative reliability), and standard error of measurement (a measure of absolute reliability) were calculated as indices of concurrent validity and reliability of the MSL test. Minimal detectable change was also calculated; this represents actual change beyond that of measurement error or random variation in stepping performance. RESULTS: Correlations between MSL score and clinical balance measures and self-reported number of falls in the past 12 months ranged from fair to good. Same-day and 1-month intrarater test-retest reliability of the MSL test was excellent. Same-day interrater reliability between 2 raters was also excellent. Measurement error of the MSL test was low. Minimal detectable change for the MSL test at the 95% confidence level was 7.32 inches. CONCLUSION: The MSL test appears to be a valid and reliable measure of balance-impairment and falls risk in older adults. Clinicians should consider incorporating the MSL test into their battery of falls risk assessment tools. Use of this test as a screening measure may reduce the incidence of falls in community-dwelling older adults. Real change in performance requires a difference of more than 7.32 inches between trials; differences less than this should be interpreted as being due to measurement error or random variation in stepping performance.",nocancer
"Lymphomatoid granulomatosis: insights gained over 4 decades. Lymphomatoid granulomatosis is a rare lymphoproliferative disease involving predominantly the lung, and there is uncertainty about its relationship to lymphoma. It affects mainly middle-aged adults, although there is a wide age range, and men are affected almost twice as often as women. Multiple nodular, usually bilateral, infiltrates are seen radiographically, and extrapulmonary involvement, especially of skin and nervous system, occurs in more than one third of the patients. Mortality rates are high, and treatment modes are not well established. Morphologically, there is a nodular polymorphous mononuclear cell infiltrate with prominent vascular infiltration and often necrosis. Varying numbers of large, often atypical, CD20-positive B-lymphocytes are present within a background containing numerous CD3-positive small T lymphocytes and scattered admixed plasma cells and histiocytes. Evidence of Epstein-Barr virus infection can be shown in most cases by in-situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus RNA. The infiltrate is graded as 1 to 3 based on the proportion of large B cells. Morphologically, there is overlap in grades 2 and 3 with variants of large B-cell lymphoma, and many such cases show evidence of monoclonality by polymerase chain reaction. It is suggested that lymphoma (T-cell rich large B-cell or diffuse large B-cell) be diagnosed in addition to lymphomatoid granulomatosis in grades 2 and 3 to appropriately communicate the nature of the disease to clinicians.",cancer
"Initial analysis of relationship between plasma platinum concentration and hematological adverse reaction associated with weekly chemotherapy using nedaplatin in combination with radiotherapy for cervical carcinoma. PURPOSE: Established therapeutic guidelines for cervical carcinoma recommend concurrent chemo- and radiotherapy as standard treatment for locally advanced cervical carcinoma. Nedaplatin (CDGP) is a platinum agent developed in Japan that is less nephrotoxic than cisplatin (CDDP), but with equivalent antitumor potency. In the standard dosage regimen for cervical carcinoma, CDGP is administered once every four weeks (monthly regimen). We investigated the efficacy and safety of a new dosage regimen, in which CDGP was administered once weekly for five weeks (weekly regimen). METHODS: We measured plasma platinum concentration of patients after administration of CDGP, and analyzed the relationship between plasma platinum concentration and hematological adverse reactions such as thrombocytopenia and leucopenia. RESULTS: The relative rates of change in platelet and white blood cell counts tended to increase as the plasma concentration of platinum increased. Furthermore, the rate of change in platelet counts in relation to the area under the curve was greater for the monthly regimen as compared to weekly. On the other hand, the relative rates of change in WBC were nearly the same between the regimens. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that when using chemotherapy with CDGP for a patient with a cervical carcinoma, a weekly regimen might reduce the severity of thrombocytopenia, while still exhibiting the same therapeutic efficacy as the monthly regimen.",cancer
Bell's palsy in pregnancy and the puerperium: a report of five cases. The incidence of idiopathic facial nerve palsy is higher during pregnancy and the puerperium than in nonpregnant women of childbearing age. An important association also exists between Bell's palsy and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. We describe three patients with idiopathic facial nerve palsy in pregnancy and two in the puerperium. Two of these were associated with hypertensive disorder of pregnancy. This case report illustrates the fact that Bell's palsy is common in pregnancy and in the peurperium and often associated with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.,nocancer
"Endemicity of human metapneumovirus subgenogroups A2 and B2 in Yamagata, Japan, between 2004 and 2009. To clarify a longitudinal epidemiology,we isolated 280 hMPV strains from patients with acute respiratory infections in Yamagata, Japan, between 2004 and 2009.We observed that the high season for hMPV was from winter to spring (between January and May) and the low season was in the fall (around September and October). A further molecular analysis revealed that subgenogroup A2 (A2) strains were the most commonly isolated (151/280; 53.9%), followed by B2 (108/280; 38.6%) and B1 (19/280; 6.8%). Our results suggested that A2 and B2 have been endemically in circulation as the major types almost every year, whereas other subgenogroups have appeared less frequently.",nocancer
"Late metastasis of gastrointestinal stromal tumour to the oral cavity. This report describes the diagnosis and treatment of a metastasis of a gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) to the oral cavity in a 64-year-old female, 14 years after treatment for a gastric primary and 11 years after partial hepatectomy for regional recurrence. The metastasis grew slowly in the buccal soft tissues and became symptomatic by intraoral extension. Positron-emission tomography combined with computed tomography depicted a solitary space-occupying lesion in the right buccal region with high standardized uptake values. Surgical exploration revealed a ball-shaped firm tumour mass adhering to the adjacent tissues that was completely resected. Subsequent healing was uneventful. Six months following ablative surgery the patient was in good general condition. There were neither signs of local tumour recurrence nor further distant spread. However, the patient is now under continuous medication with imatinib. GIST metastases to the head and neck region are very rare. Two recent case reports about head and neck metastases of GIST showed a predilection for bone. This metastasis was solely located in the oral soft tissues.",cancer
"Twenty-one years of experience with minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum by the Nuss procedure in 1215 patients. OBJECTIVE: To review the technical improvements and changes in management that have occurred over 21 years, which have made the minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum safer and more successful. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: In 1997, we reported our 10-year experience with a new minimally invasive technique for surgical correction of pectus excavatum in 42 children. Since then, we have treated an additional 1173 patients, and in this report, we summarize the technical modifications which have made the repair safer and more successful. METHODS: From January 1987 to December 2008, we evaluated 2378 pectus excavatum patients. We established criteria for surgical intervention, and patients with a clinically and objectively severe deformity were offered surgical correction. The objective criteria used for surgical correction included computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest, resting pulmonary function studies (spirometry and/or plethysmography), and a cardiology evaluation which included echocardiogram and electrocardiogram. Surgery was indicated if the patients were symptomatic, had a severe pectus excavatum on a clinical basis and fulfilled two or more of the following: CT index greater than 3.25, evidence of cardiac or pulmonary compression on CT or echocardiogram, mitral valve prolapse, arrhythmia, or restrictive lung disease. Data regarding evaluation, treatment, and follow up have been prospectively recorded since 1994. Surgical repair was performed in 1215 (51%) of 2378 patients evaluated. Of these, 1123 were primary repairs, and 92 were redo operations. Bars have been removed from 854 patients; 790 after primary repair operations, and 64 after redo operations. RESULTS: The mean Haller CT index was 5.15 +/- 2.32 (mean +/- SD). Pulmonary function studies performed in 739 patients showed that FVC, FEV1, and FEF25-75 values were decreased by a mean of 15% below predicted value. Mitral valve prolapse was present in 18% (216) of 1215 patients and arrhythmias in 16% (194). Of patients who underwent surgery, 2.8% (35 patients) had genetically confirmed Marfan syndrome and an additional 17.8% (232 patients) had physical features suggestive of Marfan syndrome. Scoliosis was noted in 28% (340). At primary operation, 1 bar was placed in 69% (775 patients), 2 bars in 30% (338), and 3 bars in 0.4% (4). Complications decreased markedly over 21 years. In primary operation patients, the bar displacement rate requiring surgical repositioning decreased from 12% in the first decade to 1% in the second decade. Allergy to nickel was identified in 2.8% (35 patients) of whom 22 identified preoperatively received a titanium bar, 10 patients were treated successfully with prednisone and 3 required bar removal: 2 were switched to a titanium bar, and 1 required no further treatment. Wound infection occurred in 1.4% (17 patients), of whom 4 required surgical drainage (0.4% of the total). Hemothorax occurred in 0.6% (8 patients); 4 during the postoperative period and four occurred late. Postoperative pulmonary function testing has shown significant improvement. A good or excellent anatomic surgical outcome was achieved in 95.8% of patients at the time of bar removal. A fair result occurred in 1.4%, poor in 0.8%, and recurrence of sufficient severity to require reoperation occurred in 11 primary surgical patients (1.4%). Five patients (0.6%) had their bars removed elsewhere. In the 752 patients, more than 1 year post bar removal, the mean time from initial operation to last follow up was 1341 +/- 28 days (SEM), and time from bar removal to last follow-up is 854 +/- 51 days. Age at operation has shifted from a median age of 6 years (range 1-15) in the original report to 14 years (range 1-31). The minimally invasive procedure has been successfully performed in 253 adult patients aged 18 to 31 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: The minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum has been performed safely and effectively in 1215 patients with a 95.8% good to excellent anatomic result in the primary repairs at our institution.",nocancer
Liquid based cytology improves the positive predictive value of glandular smears compared to conventional cytology. PURPOSE: To investigate whether the introduction of liquid-based cytology (LBC) in an urban setting decreases the diagnosis of glandular neoplasia (grade 6) and improves the positive predictive value (PPV) of cervical cytological screening. METHODS: A retrospective database review was conducted identifying women with cervical cytological abnormalities including glandular neoplasia (grade 6) before and after the introduction of LBC. RESULTS: Following the introduction of LBC the rate of glandular neoplasia (grade 6) referrals fell from 1.08% to 0.69% of all cervical cytological abnormalities. There was a significant reduction in 'abnormal' cytological samples subsequently found to be associated with no invasive or preinvasive disease but no decrease in the number showing preinvasive or invasive disease. A significant decrease in number of patients having a final diagnosis of normal/inflammatory or wart changes was seen in those patients referred during the LBC period (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The introduction of LBC in an urban setting decreased cytological glandular neoplasia referrals but not at the expense of missing preinvasive and invasive cancers. It has also increased the PPV of cervical sampling to detect preinvasive and invasive cancer from 59.6% to 76.0%.,cancer
"Neurological complications of systemic cancer. Neurological complications of systemic cancer-those arising outside the nervous system-can be distressing, disabling, and sometimes fatal. Diagnosis is often difficult because different neurological disorders may present with similar signs and symptoms. Furthermore, comorbid neurological illnesses, common in elderly patients with cancer, can complicate diagnosis. Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment can improve neurological symptoms and can substantially enhance a patient's quality of life. We approach the problem of neurological complications of systemic cancer as would a neurologist: first by identifying the anatomical area or areas that are affected (ie, brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerve), then by evaluating the diagnostic approach, considering the symptoms and signs and including appropriate laboratory tests, and finally, by recommending treatment. We focus on disorders that are difficult to diagnose, need neurological consultation, and for which effective treatments exist.",cancer
"Teaching cognates in isolation and context: a practical note on Montelongo, et al. (2009). The use of cognates in teaching word identification and vocabulary meaning is an underused resource in the teaching of English-language learners, especially for learners whose language is similar to English, e.g., Spanish. A recent study by Montelongo, Hernandez, Herter, and Hernandez reported that the effect of initial consonants was strong for recognizing words in isolation. In addition, they pointed out that cognates containing suffixes identical between English and Spanish were more quickly recognized than cognates containing similar but not identical suffixes. Further, they stated teachers would do well to take these differences into account when employing a cognate strategy with their Latino English-language learners. The purpose of this response is to discuss how different types of cognates and their various meanings may be examined by educators and students when employing cognates as a strategy in learning English.",nocancer
"Clinical studies with anti-CTLA-4 antibodies in non-melanoma indications. Available medical treatments have limited impact on the survival of patients with advanced cancer; therefore, new therapeutic strategies able to generate more effective host's immune responses against neoplastic cells are being actively pursued. Among these, a recent approach involves targeting of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), a key immune checkpoint molecule, by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Ipilimumab and tremelimumab represent the prototypes of this new class of immunomodulating mAb and have been extensively tested in metastatic melanoma with highly promising results. The clinical activity observed in melanoma has served as a model to exploit the therapeutic potential of CTLA-4 blockade in a variety of human malignancies. Along this line, early-phase trials with anti-CTLA-4 mAbs have been completed or are ongoing in tumors of different histotype. Results are demonstrating the feasibility, safety, and activity of these agents, thus suggesting a promising therapeutic role to be further investigated in phase II/III trials in a wide range of tumors. This review summarizes the main trials with ipilimumab and tremelimumab in tumors of different histotypes, excluding cutaneous melanoma, which is extensively described in other chapters of this issue of Seminars in Oncology.",cancer
"Monte Carlo evaluation of scatter mitigation strategies in cone-beam CT. PURPOSE: To investigate the efficacy of two widely used scatter mitigation methods: antiscatter grids (ASGs) and beam modulating with bowtie filters (BTFs), in combination with subtractive scatter correction or zeroth order normalization phantom calibration, for improving image noise, contrast, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and image uniformity for on-board cone-beam CT (CBCT) imaging systems used for image-guided radiation therapy. METHODS: PTRAN Monte Carlo CBCT x-ray projections of head and pelvic phantoms were calculated for combinations of beam-modulation and scatter rejection methods and images were reconstructed by in-house developed software. In addition, a simple one-dimensional analytic model was developed to predict scatter-to-primary ratio (SPR) and CNR as a function of cylindrical phantom thickness, ASG transmission, and beam modulation with bow-tie filters. RESULTS: ASGs were found to have slightly negative or no effect on head phantom image CNR and to modestly improve CNR (10%-20%) in pelvic phantom images. However, scatter subtraction and norm-phantom calibration perform better when applied on data acquired with ASGs. Scatter subtraction improves CT number accuracy, but increases noise, and in high SPR/low primary-photon transmission scenarios can dramatically reduce CNR and introduce streaking artifacts. The BTF is found to reduce SPR and image noise, resulting in a better trade-off between CNR and imaging dose, but introduces a circular band artifact. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that ASGs have a modest positive impact in pelvic scans and negative in head scans, scatter subtraction improves the HU accuracy but reduces CNR, while BTF has a clearly positive effect.",cancer
"Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and infectious mononucleosis. Infectious mononucleosis (IM) is a clinical syndrome that is common in adolescents and young adults and is characterized by fever, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, and fatigue. IM is most commonly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in which case laboratory findings include a lymphocytosis with an elevated number of atypical lymphocytes seen on peripheral smear and a heterophile or EBV-specific antibody response. Approximately 10% of those with IM will not be acutely infected with EBV. Many of these individuals will have their symptoms attributed to cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. This chapter reviews the history, diagnosis, clinical management, and potential complications of both EBV- and CMV-associated IM in adolescents and young adults.",cancer
"Sarcomatoid squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix successfully treated by laparoscopic radical hysterectomy: a case report. BACKGROUND: Sarcomatoid squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix is a rare tumor with uncertain pathogenesis. The rarity of this neoplasm makes it difficult to diagnose and manage, and it seems to be an aggressive tumor with a short disease-free survival. To date, < 20 cases have been reported. We report the first case of sarcomatoid carcinoma successfully treated by laparoscopic radical hysterectomy. CASE: A 26-year-old woman presented with postcoital spotting. Gynecologic examination revealed an approximately 2.5-cm-diameter mass on the posterior lip of the cervix, and biopsy revealed a sarcomatoid carcinoma. After the baseline study for cervical cancer, the patient was found to have International Federation of Obstetricians and Gynecologists stage IB1 disease. The patient underwent laparoscopic radical hysterectomy with bilateral pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy. Histopathologic examination showed no evidence of parametrial tumor extension or lymph node metastasis, and no adjuvant treatment was given. CONCLUSION: This report entails the first description of laparoscopic surgery for sarcomatoid carcinoma of the cervix. Despite short-term follow-up, it seems that early-stage disease could be successfully treated by laparoscopic radical hysterectomy.",cancer
"Evaluation of preoperative diagnosis with results of histopathological examinations of ovarian tumors in women of reproductive age. Ovarian tumors are the most frequent lesions encountered by gynecologists. Ovarian carcinoma most often develops asymptomatically and until now no sufficient screening diagnostic methods have been developed, which is why various diagnostic methods are being tried concurrently to increase diagnostic sensitivity. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the compliance of the preoperative diagnoses with the results of histopathological examinations of ovarian tumors and to determine the usefulness of simultaneous application of gynecological, ultrasonographic, and Doppler examinations together with determination of CA-125 antigen in the diagnostic process of ovarian tumors. The study comprised a group of 250 women in reproductive age who were operated on for tumors of the ovary. Results of histopathological examinations were compared with the preoperative diagnosis based on the above-mentioned examinations and prognostic indicators: sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive prediction value as well as accuracy were determined. The results showed that combining the four diagnostic methods is a useful research panel in the preoperative diagnostic process of ovarian tumors and makes selecting the appropriate procedure and surgical treatment viable.",cancer

"Does this older adult with lower extremity pain have the clinical syndrome of lumbar spinal stenosis? CONTEXT: The clinical syndrome of lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a common diagnosis in older adults presenting with lower extremity pain. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the accuracy of the clinical examination for the diagnosis of the clinical syndrome of LSS. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL searches of articles published from January 1966 to September 2010. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included if they contained adequate data on the accuracy of the history and physical examination for diagnosing the clinical syndrome of LSS, using a reference standard of expert opinion with radiographic or anatomic confirmation. DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors independently reviewed each study to determine eligibility, extract data, and appraise levels of evidence. DATA SYNTHESIS: Four studies evaluating 741 patients were identified. Among patients with lower extremity pain, the likelihood of the clinical syndrome of LSS was increased for individuals older than 70 years (likelihood ratio [LR], 2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-2.5), and was decreased for those younger than 60 years (LR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.29-0.57). The most useful symptoms for increasing the likelihood of the clinical syndrome of LSS were having no pain when seated (LR, 7.4; 95% CI, 1.9-30), improvement of symptoms when bending forward (LR, 6.4; 95% CI, 4.1-9.9), the presence of bilateral buttock or leg pain (LR, 6.3; 95% CI, 3.1-13), and neurogenic claudication (LR, 3.7; 95% CI, 2.9-4.8). Absence of neurogenic claudication (LR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.17-0.31) decreased the likelihood of the diagnosis. A wide-based gait (LR, 13; 95% CI, 1.9-95) and abnormal Romberg test result (LR, 4.2; 95% CI, 1.4-13) increased the likelihood of the clinical syndrome of LSS. A score of 7 or higher on a diagnostic support tool including history and examination findings increased the likelihood of the clinical syndrome of LSS (LR, 3.3; 95% CI, 2.7-4.0), while a score lower than 7 made the diagnosis much less likely (LR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.06-0.16). CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of the clinical syndrome of LSS requires the appropriate clinical picture and radiographic findings. Absence of pain when seated and improvement of symptoms when bending forward are the most useful individual findings. Combinations of findings are most useful for identifying patients who are unlikely to have the diagnosis.",nocancer
"Use and assessment of PSA in prostate cancer. Since the introduction of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening in the late 1980s, more prostate cancers have been detected, and at an earlier stage. As a consequence, the majority of prostate cancers are now detected years before the emergence of clinically evident disease, which usually represents locally advanced or metastatic cancer. PSA screening has remained controversial, because many of the prostate cancers detected are low grade and slow growing. With this long natural history and a median survival without treatment that often approaches at least 15 to 20 years, many clinicians and researchers have questioned if prostate cancer screening and treatment actually improves survival, as many patients will die with prostate cancer rather than of prostate cancer. In this review, the authors discuss the rationale for prostate cancer screening and present the current guidelines for the use of PSA.",cancer
"Defining and achieving treatment success in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Traditionally, successful treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) has been defined strictly by achievement of targeted glycemic control, primarily using a stepped-care approach that begins with changes in lifestyle combined with oral therapy that is slowly intensified as disease progression advances and beta-cell function declines. However, stepped care is often adjusted without regard to the mechanism of hyperglycemia or without long-term objectives. A more comprehensive definition of treatment success in patients with type 2 DM should include slowing or stopping disease progression and optimizing the reduction of all risk factors associated with microvascular and macrovascular disease complications. To achieve these broader goals, it is important to diagnose diabetes earlier in the disease course and to consider use of more aggressive combination therapy much earlier with agents that have the potential to slow or halt the progressive beta-cell dysfunction and loss characteristic of type 2 DM. A new paradigm for managing patients with type 2 DM should address the concomitant risk factors and morbidities of obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia with equal or occasionally even greater aggressiveness than for hyperglycemia. The use of antidiabetes agents that may favorably address cardiovascular risk factors should be considered more strongly in treatment algorithms, although no pharmacological therapy is likely to be ultimately successful without concomitant synergistic lifestyle changes. Newer incretin-based therapies, such as glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors, which appear to have a favorable cardiovascular safety profile as well as the mechanistic possibility for a favorable cardiovascular risk impact, are suitable for earlier inclusion as part of combination regimens aimed at achieving comprehensive treatment success in patients with type 2 DM.",nocancer
"Patient-controlled analgesia infusion pumps for adults. Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) via an infusion pump enables patients experiencing pain as a result of surgery, trauma or acute exacerbation of chronic conditions, to administer their own analgesia.

This article, one of series on pain, describes the main features of opioid PCA, highlighting potential risks associated with this method of drug administration and common side effects of opioids. The article emphasises the importance of educating patients in PCA use to maintain safety. It is suggested that nurses must provide the same level of care to patients using PCA as patients receiving analgesia by other means.",nocancer
"Minority dental faculty development: responsibility and challenge. Over at least the last twenty years, the American Dental Education Association (ADEA) has given attention and priority to increasing the number of underrepresented minority (URM) dental school applicants, enrollees, and faculty members and to meeting the challenges of achieving diversity in the oral health workforce of the future as racial and ethnic minorities continue to grow and are expected to comprise more than 50 percent of the U.S. population by the middle of the twenty-first century. Dental schools have the responsibility of preparing dentists to provide oral health care for the nation's population.

"Rational noncompliance with prescribed medical treatment. Despite the attention that patient noncompliance has received from medical researchers, patient noncompliance remains poorly understood and difficult to alter. With a better theory of patient noncompliance, both greater success in achieving compliance and greater respect for patient decision making are likely. The theory presented, which uses a microeconomic approach, bridges a gap in the extant literature that has so far ignored the contributions of this classic perspective on decision making involving the tradeoff of costs and benefits. The model also generates a surprising conclusion: that patients are typically acting rationally when they refuse to comply with certain treatments. However, compliance is predicted to rise with increased benefits and reduced costs. The prediction that noncompliance is rational is especially true in chronic conditions at the point that treatment begins to move closer to the medically ideal treatment level. Although the details of this theory have not been tested empirically, it is well supported by existing prospective and retrospective studies.",nocancer
"Effect of school closure on the incidence of influenza among school-age children in Arizona. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the impact of school closures as a viable intervention in the event of an influenza pandemic. METHODS: We evaluated the effect of scheduled, two-week winter break school closures during the 2004-2008 school years on the occurrence of influenza among children aged 5-17 years in Arizona. RESULTS: We found a consistent pattern of benefit to school-age children during winter school closures when non-school-age children and adults experienced significant increases in influenza incidence, an increase not seen among school-age children. Quantitative analysis showed that school closures may prevent or delay as much as 42% of potential influenza cases among school-age children. In addition, the ratio of illness in school-age children as compared with adults and non-school-age children decreased significantly from before to during the same school closure periods. CONCLUSION: This analysis provides evidence to suggest that school-age children may experience a slowing of influenza transmission during winter school closures compared with those not of school age. Federal, state, and local policy makers may consider these findings in their pandemic influenza and public health emergency preparedness planning efforts.",nocancer
"Assessment-guided therapy of urinary incontinence after stroke. Urinary incontinence (UI) frequently occurs after stroke and often remains an extensive problem for these patients and their relatives even after discharge from the hospital. Therapeutic interventions, such as behavioral training, can help manage UI. Recently, a multimodal application of nursing interventions was recommended (Wilbert-Herr, Hurlimann, Imhof & Wilbert, 2006). The primary goals of the study discussed in this article were to introduce therapeutic interventions of UI management into clinical rehabilitation practice based on a structured process of interdisciplinary caregiving and test the treatment effect. Forty-four patients who had suffered a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) were included in the study. Nursing interventions included distinction of stress or urge UI and the assessment of different forms of UI. The latter intervention was based on the functional independence measure (FIM Item G-bladder management), the protocol of micturition, urine dipstick, and ultrasound measurement of post-void residual urine (PVR). Interventions were applied according to the recommendations of the 3rd International Consultation on Incontinence. An algorithm of the interdisciplinary process was implemented, and the nursing staff received specific education regarding the interventions. Twenty-one (47%) of the patients in the study were diagnosed with UI; 67% of these patients achieved the targeted level of continence by individually tailored interventions, which consisted of a systematic nursing assessment and standards for prompted voiding, timed voiding, and habit training. Planned processes, including screening procedures, assessment, profile of continence, intervention, and education and evaluation, increase the likelihood of positive results of rehabilitation of patients after CVA. Additional intervention studies are suggested to investigate the effectiveness of the algorithm used in this study.",nocancer
"Process for determining the cancer burden of the Hopi Tribe. The Hopi Tribe is located in the northeastern part of Arizona on more than one million acres of federally reserved land.

Both surveys identified a strong community interest in cancer. This article reports on the process involved in a third study, in which official Hopi enrollment data were matched with Arizona Cancer Registry data. The process involved bringing in a new partner and obtaining tribal, state, and university approvals, as well as a signed data exchange agreement between the state and the Hopi Tribe. Technical implementation of the data match required computer programming and epidemiologic expertise, as well as an understanding of the community and the culture.

A canonical regulatory pathway involving the members of the Bcl-2 and caspase families has been established to regulate developmental apoptosis in nematodes and flies. However, mutant mice that have major deficiencies in this apoptosis pathway show only relatively minor developmental defects. Recent revelations indicate that multiple mechanisms are involved in regulating cell death during mammalian development, tissue homeostasis, and pathological cell loss. Here, we critically evaluate the evidence demonstrating the existence of alternative cell death mechanisms, including apoptosis of lower organisms in the absence of canonical apoptosis mediators, autophagic cell death, necroptosis, elimination by shedding, keratinocyte death by cornification, and cell-cell cannibalism by entosis. The physiological relevance of alternative cell death mechanisms as primary and backup mechanisms is discussed.",nocancer
"Approach to the patient with adrenocortical carcinoma. Adrenocortical cancer (ACC) is a rare and often aggressive malignancy that requires multidisciplinary expertise for optimal management. It can present with symptoms of rapidly appearing excess steroid secretion or an abdominal mass, or it can be discovered incidentally. Thorough imaging and endocrine evaluations can identify the majority of ACCs amongst adrenal tumors; however, some smaller ACCs are better identified using fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan. Complete resection by an expert surgeon is the only potentially curative treatment for ACC, and tumor spillage should be avoided. Histopathology is important for diagnosis, but immunohistochemistry markers and gene profiling of the resected tumor may become superior to current staging systems to stratify prognosis. Despite complete resection in stage I-III tumors, approximately 40% of patients develop metastasis within 2 yr. Some retrospective studies indicate that adjuvant mitotane therapy prolongs disease-free survival, leading several centers to recommend its administration; prospective studies are under way to provide future evidence-based recommendations. For locally invading ACC, extensive en bloc resection is attempted, followed by adjuvant mitotane and, in selected cases, adjuvant radiotherapy. When ACC is not surgically resectable, mitotane therapy is adjusted to reach serum levels of 14-20 mug/ml. Careful replacement of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid deficiency after surgery or mitotane therapy is important; steroid excess from remaining tumor burden should also be controlled to avoid its morbidities. For metastatic disease, combination chemotherapy should be administered, if possible, in the context of multicenter collaborative research protocols. New insights in the molecular pathogenesis of ACC should allow the development of improved targeted therapies.",cancer
"The emerging toxicity profiles of anti-CTLA-4 antibodies across clinical indications. The promising new class of immunomodulating antibodies directed against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) has been extensively tested in clinical trials and found to be active against cutaneous melanoma and other tumor histotypes. Inhibition of CTLA-4 characteristically induces well-identified side effects for which the definition ""immune-related adverse events"" (irAEs) has been proposed. IrAEs mainly include colitis/diarrhea, dermatitis, hepatitis, and endocrinopathies; uveitis, nephritis, and inflammatory myopathy also have been reported occasionally. These unique side effects are likely a direct result of breaking immune tolerance upon CTLA-4 blockade and are generally mild, reversible, and manageable, following specific treatment guidelines that include symptomatic therapies or systemic corticosteroids. However, patient-physician communication and early treatment are also emerging as critical issues to successfully manage irAEs, thus avoiding major complications. The major experience in identifying and managing CTLA-4 treatment-related side effects has derived from studies in melanoma patients; nevertheless, accumulating clinical experiences are clearly demonstrating that irAEs are class-specific events, and that they are fully overlapping in patients with tumors of different histotypes. This review provides an overview of current safety data on CTLA-4 antagonists and of available strategies to optimize their clinical use in cancer patients.",cancer
"Angiotensin-2 receptors (AT1-R and AT2-R), new prognostic factors for renal clear-cell carcinoma? BACKGROUND: The growth factor Angiotensin-2 signals through Angiotensin receptor type 1 (AT1-R) in a broad range of cell types and tumours and through the type-2 receptor (AT2-R) in a more restricted group of cell types. Although numerous forms of cancer have been shown to overexpress AT1-R, expression of AT1-R and AT2-R by human renal clear-cell carcinoma (RCCC) is not well understood. In this study, the expression of both angiotensin receptors was quantified in a retrospective series of RCCC and correlated with prognostic factors. METHODS: Angiotensin receptor type 1 and AT2-R expressions were quantified on tumour tissues by immunohistochemistry (IHC), western blot and quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). IHC results were correlated to Fuhrman's grade and patient progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: A total of 84 RCCC were analysed. By IHC, AT1-R and AT2-R were expressed to a greater level in high-grade tumours (AT1-R: P<0.001, AT2-R: P<0.001). Univariate analysis showed a correlation between PFS and AT1-R or AT2-R expression (P=0.001). By multivariate analysis, only AT2-R expression correlated with PFS (HR 1.021, P=0.006) and cancer stage (P<0.001). By western blot, AT1-R and AT1-R were also found to be overexpressed in higher Fuhrman's grade (P<0.01 and P=0.001 respectively). By qRT-PCR, AT1-R but not AT2-R mRNA were downregulated (P=0.001 and P=0.118, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our results show that AT1-R and AT2-R proteins are overexpressed in the most aggressive forms of RCCC and that AT2-R expression correlates with PFS. AT1-R or AT2-R blockage could, therefore, offer novel directions for anti-RCCC therapy.",cancer
"A pilot study for the analysis of dream reports using Maslow's need categories: an extension to the emotional selection hypothesis. The emotional selection hypothesis describes a cyclical process that uses dreams to modify and test select mental schemas. An extension is proposed that further characterizes these schemas as facilitators of human need satisfaction. A pilot study was conducted in which this hypothesis was tested by assigning 100 dream reports (10 randomly selected from 10 dream logs at an online web site) to one or more categories within Maslow's hierarchy of needs. A ""match"" was declared when at least two of three judges agreed both for category and for whether the identified need was satisfied or thwarted in the dream narrative. The interjudge reliability of the judged needs was good (92% of the reports contained at least one match). The number of needs judged as thwarted did not differ significantly from the number judged as satisfied (48 vs. 52%, respectively). The six ""higher"" needs (belongingness, esteem, cognitive, aesthetic, self-actualization, and transcendence) were scored significantly more frequently (81%) than were the two lowest or ""basic"" needs (physiological and safety, 19%). Basic needs were also more likely to be judged as thwarted, while higher needs were more likely to be judged as satisfied. These findings are discussed in the context of Maslow's hierarchy of needs as a framework for investigating theories of dream function, including the emotional selection hypothesis and other contemporary dream theories.",nocancer
"Investigation of the eIF2alpha phosphorylation mechanism in response to proteasome inhibition in melanoma and breast cancer cells. The 26S proteasome is an ATP-dependent proteolytic complex found in all eukaryotes, archaebacteria, and some eubacteria. Inhibition of the 26S proteasome causes pleiotropic effects in cells, including cellular apoptosis, a fact that has led to the use of the 26S proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, for treatment of the multiple myeloma cancer. We previously showed that in addition to the effects of proteolysis, inhibition of the 26S proteasome causes a rapid decrease in the protein synthesis rate due to phosphorylating alfa subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha) by the heme-regulated inhibitor kinase (HRI). In order to test whether inhibition of the 26S proteasome causes the same effect in cancer cells, we have investigated the influence of two commonly used proteasome inhibitors, bortezomib and MG132, on the phosphorylation status of eIF2alpha in B16F10 melanoma and 4T1 breast cancer cells. It was found that both of the inhibitors caused rapid phosphorylation of eIF2alpha. Taking into account that the Hsp70 is a critical component needed for the HRI activation and enzymatic activity, we have tested a possible participation of this protein in the eIF2alpha phosphorylation event. However, treatment of the cells with two structurally different Hsp70 inhibitors, quercetin and KNK437, in the presence of the proteasome inhibitors did not affect the eIF2alpha phosphorylation. In addition, neither protein kinase C (PKC) nor p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was required for the proteasome inhibitor-induced eIF2alpha phosphorylation; futhermore, both the PKC inhibitor staurosporine and the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 caused enchanced phosphorylation of eLF2alpha. Zinc (II) protoporphyrine IX (ZnPP), an inhibitor of the heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which has also been previously reported to be involved in HRI activation, also failed to prevent the induction of eIF2alpha phosphorylation in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib or MG132.",cancer
"Pediatric brain tumor treatment: growth consequences and their management. Tumors of the central nervous system, the most common solid tumors of childhood, are a major source of cancer-related morbidity and mortality in children. Survival rates have improved significantly following treatment for childhood brain tumors, with this growing cohort of survivors at high risk of adverse medical and late effects. Endocrine morbidities are the most prominent disorder among the spectrum of longterm conditions, with growth hormone deficiency the most common endocrinopathy noted, either from tumor location or after cranial irradiation and treatment effects on the hypothalamic/pituitary unit. Deficiency of other anterior pituitary hormones can contribute to negative effects on growth, body image and composition, sexual function, skeletal health, and quality of life. Pediatric and adult endocrinologists often provide medical care to this increasing population. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the epidemiology and pathophysiology of growth failure as a consequence of childhood brain tumor, both during and after treatment, is necessary and the main focus of this review.",cancer
"Molecular and immunohistologic analyses cannot reliably solve diagnostic variation of flat intraepithelial lesions of the urinary bladder. We examined diagnostic variation of flat intraurothelial lesions with comparison with immunohistochemical and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses. Nine uropathologists diagnosed 23 biopsy samples from the urinary bladder. The samples were analyzed by immunohistochemical expression of cytokeratin 20, high-molecular-weight cytokeratin, Ki-67, p53, and p16(INK4a), and multicolor FISH using the UroVysion probe set (Vysis, Abbott, Des Plaines, IL). Diagnostic agreement for each classification and for nonneoplastic or neoplastic lesions was obtained in 8 (35%) and 16 (70%) of 23 lesions, respectively. The preference ratio of neoplasia to nonneoplasia (0.9 to 4.8) or carcinoma in situ to dysplasia (0.2 to 4.0) also varied among the pathologists. In 6 ancillary analyses, the majority of neoplastic lesions with diagnostic agreement indicated more than 2 aberrant results, whereas the majority of lesions without diagnostic agreement showed no or only 1 aberrant result. The molecular and immunohistochemical analyses can discriminate between neoplastic and nonneoplastic lesions; however, they cannot reliably solve diagnostic variation of flat intraepithelial lesions.",cancer
"The prognosis for patients with osteosarcoma who have received prior manipulative therapy. We evaluated the long-term outcome of patients with an osteosarcoma who had undergone prior manipulative therapy, a popular treatment in Asia, and investigated its effects on several prognostic factors. Of the 134 patients in this study, 70 (52%) patients had manipulative therapy and 64 (48%) did not. The age, location, and size of tumour were not significantly different between the groups. The five-year overall survival rate was 58% and 92% in the groups with and without manipulative therapy (p = 0.004). Both the primary and overall rates of lung metastasis were significantly higher in the manipulative group (primary: 32% vs 3%, p = 0.003; overall lung metastasis rate: 51.4% vs 18.8%, p < 0.001). Patients who had manipulative therapy had higher local recurrence rates in comparison to patients who did not (29% vs 6%, p = 0.011). The prognosis for patients with osteosarcoma who had manipulative therapy was significantly poorer than those who had not. Manipulative therapy was an independent factor for survival. This form of therapy may serve as a mechanism to accelerate the spread of tumour cells, and therefore must be avoided in order to improve the outcome for patients with an osteosarcoma.",cancer
"Practice patterns of primary care providers and urologists for use of medical expulsion therapy. PURPOSE: Alpha-blockers and calcium channel blockers have shown promise for medical expulsion therapy (MET) of distal ureteral calculi < 1 cm in size. Although MET has been discussed in urology for some time, little has been written about MET in the emergency medicine and primary care literature. We sought to evaluate current practice patterns of MET among urologists, emergency medicine physicians, other primary care providers, and frontline military care providers. METHODS: Web-based, self-developed survey to assess the current practice patterns of providers for the initial management of uncomplicated ureteral calculi, and specifically, their frequency of using MET. Cross-tabulation strategies utilizing compiled survey results were used to assess survey outcomes and determine prevalence values for understanding, familiarity, and therapeutic interventions for nephrolithiasis. RESULTS: Of 293 medical professionals, 114 (39%) were urologists, 55 (48%) of which were fellowship trained in endourology. Fifty-six (19%) were emergency medicine physicians, 22 (8%) were family practitioners, and 19 (7%) were internists and other primary care physicians. Other physician subspecialists and medical paraprofessionals comprised the remaining 34%. Overall 27% of respondents were unfamiliar with MET for expulsion of uncomplicated ureteral stones, including 13% of staff physicians, 21% of emergency medicine doctors, 56% of family practitioners, 40% of internists, and 43% of other primary care providers. The overall prevalence of use of MET was 45%. All urologists were familiar with MET, but 31% rarely, never, or only sometimes used this therapy. Specifically, urologists, emergency physicians, family practitioners, internists, and other providers, usually or always used MET 69%, 55%, 16%, 16%, and 27%, of the time, respectively. In academic institutions, 71.6% use MET usually or almost always compared to 36% in military healthcare settings and 47% in other practice settings. Tamsulosin is the most widely used medication for MET, accounting for 57% of MET use. Factors identified that inhibit more widespread use of MET include, physician unfamiliarity with MET (72%), the belief that MET is not effective (10%), patient unwillingness to undergo MET (5%), and medications not covered by insurance plans (4%). CONCLUSION: While MET has been established as a reasonable adjunct for management of uncomplicated ureteral stones, it may be underutilized due to physician unfamiliarity with this type of treatment and perceived ineffectiveness. This therapy may be of particular benefit to forward deployed forces. Education programs and practice-specific guidelines to target this audience may help to improve the dispersion of MET into the medical community.",nocancer

"Adenoid cystic carcinoma in the uterine cervix: a case report. BACKGROUND: Adenoid cystic carcinoma, a variant of adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix, is an extremely rare neoplasm. This report describes a case of primary adenoid cystic carcinoma of the uterine cervix and includes the cytopathologic and histopathologic findings. CASE: A 55-year-old woman presented with postmenopausal bleeding for 2 months. Speculum examination showed a firm mass in the uterine cervix. A Pap smear was obtained, which showed small epithelial cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and coarse chromatin dispersed and adhered around hyaline stromal globular material, along with a few atypical squamous cells. The diagnosis of adenoid cystic carcinoma was confirmed by the histopathologic examination of the biopsy specimen as well as the excised specimen, which characteristically revealed the presence of a cribriform pattern of the tumor cells. CONCLUSION: We reported a case of a rare and unusual variant of adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix by considering the characteristic cytologic features of the globules of pale, translucent material surrounded by halos of cells in cribriform adenoid cystic carcinoma.",cancer
"Plant and animal sensors of conserved microbial signatures. The last common ancestor of plants and animals may have lived 1 billion years ago. Plants and animals have occasionally exchanged genes but, for the most part, have countered selective pressures independently. Microbes (bacteria, eukaryotes, and viruses) were omnipresent threats, influencing the direction of multicellular evolution. Receptors that detect molecular signatures of infectious organisms mediate awareness of nonself and are integral to host defense in plants and animals alike. The discoveries leading to elucidation of these receptors and their ligands followed a similar logical and methodological pathway in both plant and animal research.",nocancer
"Primary leiomyosarcoma of the pancreas: study of 9 cases and review of literature. Primary pancreatic leiomyosarcomas are rare lesions and not well described, yet they are the most common primary pancreatic sarcoma. English-language medical literature reports 29 cases as single cases or small series. A systematized nomenclature of medicine (SNOMED) search of Mayo Clinic surgical pathology files from 1994 to 2006 identified 22 primary pancreatic leiomyosarcomas. Nine patients with pancreatic leiomyosarcoma were diagnosed and treated at our institution (5 males and 4 females; mean age at diagnosis, 63 y; range, 39 to 87 y) are described, with a literature review. In situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded RNA (EBER) was conducted in all cases to exclude EBV-associated smooth muscle tumor (EBV-SMT). Seven of the 9 patients presented with abdominal pain, weight loss, and jaundice. Seven tumors (mean, 10.7 cm; range, 1.0 to 30 cm) were located in the pancreatic head and 2 in the tail. Histologic findings of primary pancreatic leiomyosarcomas (7 spindle and 2 epithelioid) were similar to leiomyosarcomas of other sites. All tumors stained positive for smooth muscle actin and desmin and negative for KIT. No case showed EBER positivity. Pancreaticoduodenectomy was done in 4 patients; 3 patients had palliative procedures, and 2 had biopsy only. No lymph node metastasis was identified in 4 resected tumors, but liver metastases were present in 4 patients. All patients died; 5 deaths were known to be disease related (overall mean survival, 31 months; range, 5 to 98 mo). Historical cases showed similar clinicopathologic findings. These pancreatic leiomyosarcoma lesions have the same morphologic features as their counterparts of other sites. EBER testing should be conducted--especially for pediatric patients--to rule out EBV-SMT. The tumor is likely to metastasize to liver but not regional lymph nodes. Extensive surgical resection should be advocated, even when morphologic results show a low-grade lesion.",cancer
"Modeling scatter-to-primary dose ratio for megavoltage photon beams. PURPOSE: A three-parameter semiempirical model for scatter-to-primary dose ratio (SPR) is proposed to fit PDD (or TPR) and S(p) beam data. The SPR formula proposed in this study is more accurate than the previously published formula utilizing two parameters, especially for lower energy megavoltage photon beams, because the effect of backscattered photons is now taken into account. METHODS: Monte Carlo (MC) calculated SPR for photon energy spectrum between 60Co and 24 MV are used to evaluate the accuracy of the models. Based on fitting the MC data, the dependence of the SPR parameters (a0, w0,d0) with the attenuation coefficients of the photon beams is obtained and they were incorporated into the authors' optimization routine. The ability of the optimization routine to fit measured clinic data is examined for photon energies ranging from 60Co to 25 MV for all major cobalt and linear accelerator manufacturers. RESULTS: The authors' model successfully fits the measured photon beam data for field size (E/3-40 cm), where E is photon energy in MV and for clinically usable depths, d(max) to 20 cm for 60Co, d(max) to 30 cm for 4 MV, and d(max) to 40 cm for 6 MV and higher photon energies. The maximum error among these fits is better than 2% for photon energies above 60Co. CONCLUSIONS: The new SPR formula, along with the optimization routine, can serve as an efficient tool for performing quality control of x-ray beam data that conforms to AAPM Radiation Therapy Committee TG40 and Therapy Physics Committee TG142 reports on beam data requirement.",cancer
"Inhibition of RIP2's tyrosine kinase activity limits NOD2-driven cytokine responses. Upon intracellular bacterial exposure, the Crohn's disease and sarcoidosis susceptibility protein NOD2 (nucleotide oligomerization domain protein 2) binds to the protein kinase RIP2 (receptor-interacting protein 2) to coordinate NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappa B)-mediated cytokine responses. While RIP2 clearly has kinase activity, the function of its kinase domain has been enigmatic. Although originally classified as a serine-threonine kinase based on homology scans, we find that RIP2 also has tyrosine kinase activity. RIP2 undergoes autophosphorylation on Tyr 474 (Y474). This phosphorylation event is necessary for effective NOD2 signaling and does not occur in the presence of the most common Crohn's disease-associated NOD2 allele. Given this tyrosine kinase activity, a small-molecule inhibitor screen designed to identify pharmacologic agents that inhibit RIP2's tyrosine kinase activity was performed. At nanomolar concentrations, the EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib (Iressa) and erlotinib (Tarceva) were found to inhibit both RIP2 tyrosine phosphorylation and MDP (muramyl dipeptide)-induced cytokine release in a variety of NOD2 hyperactivation states. This effect is specific for RIP2 and does not depend on EGFR. The finding that RIP2 has tyrosine kinase activity and the finding that gefitinib and erlotinib, two agents already used clinically for cancer chemotherapy, can inhibit this activity suggest that RIP2's tyrosine kinase activity could be targeted specifically in the treatment of inflammatory diseases.",nocancer

"Diagnosis of carcinosarcoma metastatic to the umbilicus by fine needle aspiration biopsy: a case report. BACKGROUND: Metastasis to the umbilicus, known as Sister Mary Joseph's nodule, sometimes represents the first clinical manifestation of an internal malignancy. These nodules are infrequent, and their discovery has prognostic implications. CASE: An 86-year-old woman presented with an ultrasound diagnosis of peritoneal carcinomatosis and the presence of a round lesion in the umbilical area. A fine needle aspiration biopsy was performed. The cytologic smears showed a biphasic neoplasm composed of malignant epithelial cells with a glandular appearance and randomly scattered spindle cells in a necrotic base. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to confirm the diagnosis. CONCLUSION: After an extensive search of the literature, we discovered that this is the first report of a metastatic carcinosarcoma diagnosed by fine needle aspiration biopsy. The diagnosis of carcinosarcoma requires a clear definition of the 2 components, which is why immunohistochemical staining is very useful. The presence of an umbilical nodule should raise suspicion of an underlying malignant neoplasm. Needle aspiration biopsy should be considered as the most effective, simple, uncomplicated method of diagnosing these lesions.",cancer
"Surgical reduction in a delayed case of traumatic testicular dislocation. A 27-year-old Thai male was admitted with left groin pain and he felt that he lost his left testis three weeks after his motorcycle accident-car collision. He had not been diagnosed after four days of admission at the previous hospital. Surgical reduction was performed without acute and delayed complications after three months of follow-up. Traumatic testicular dislocation is an uncommon sequel of trauma usually related to straddle injury from motorcycle accidents. Diagnosis depends on the awareness of the physician of its possibility of occurrence. Physical examination is the most helpful in diagnosis. CT scan or Doppler ultrasound, if available, may be helpful in diagnosis, particularly locating the extrascrotal testicle and detecting testicular viability. Manual reduction is the treatment of choice for acute traumatic dislocation of testis. Open reduction is indicated for the delayed case, or if there are (1) difficulty in determining the integrity of dislocated testis, (2) possibility of torsion, (3) failure of close reduction, or (4) the minimal morbidity of an inguinal exploration.",nocancer
"A new fast and fully automated software based algorithm for extracting respiratory signal from raw PET data and its comparison to other methods. PURPOSE: Respiratory gating in PET is an approach used to minimize the negative effects of respiratory motion on spatial resolution. It is based on an initial determination of a patient's respiratory movements during a scan, typically using hardware based systems. In recent years, several fully automated databased algorithms have been presented for extracting a respiratory signal directly from PET data, providing a very practical strategy for implementing gating in the clinic. In this work, a new method is presented for extracting a respiratory signal from raw PET sinogram data and compared to previously presented automated techniques. METHODS: The acquisition of respiratory signal from PET data in the newly proposed method is based on rebinning the sinogram data into smaller data structures and then analyzing the time activity behavior in the elements of these structures. From this analysis, a 1D respiratory trace is produced, analogous to a hardware derived respiratory trace. To assess the accuracy of this fully automated method, respiratory signal was extracted from a collection of 22 clinical FDG-PET scans using this method, and compared to signal derived from several other software based methods as well as a signal derived from a hardware system. RESULTS: The method presented required approximately 9 min of processing time for each 10 min scan (using a single 2.67 GHz processor), which in theory can be accomplished while the scan is being acquired and therefore allowing a real-time respiratory signal acquisition. Using the mean correlation between the software based and hardware based respiratory traces, the optimal parameters were determined for the presented algorithm. The mean/median/range of correlations for the set of scans when using the optimal parameters was found to be 0.58/0.68/0.07-0.86. The speed of this method was within the range of real-time while the accuracy surpassed the most accurate of the previously presented algorithms. CONCLUSIONS: PET data inherently contains information about patient motion; information that is not currently being utilized. We have shown that a respiratory signal can be extracted from raw PET data in potentially real-time and in a fully automated manner. This signal correlates well with hardware based signal for a large percentage of scans, and avoids the efforts and complications associated with hardware. The proposed method to extract a respiratory signal can be implemented on existing scanners and, if properly integrated, can be applied without changes to routine clinical procedures.",cancer
"Symptoms, investigations and management of patients with cancer of the oesophagus and gastro-oesophageal junction in Australia. OBJECTIVE: To document presenting symptoms, investigations and management for Australian patients with oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC), gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (GOJAC) and oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional study of a population-based sample of 1100 Australian patients aged 18-79 years with histologically confirmed oesophageal cancer diagnosed in 2002-2005, using data from cancer registries and treatment centres, supplemented with clinical information collected through medical record review in 2006-2007 and mortality information collected in 2008. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of primary symptoms, and staging investigations and treatment modalities used. RESULTS: The primary presenting symptom was dysphagia, which was self-reported by 41%, 39% and 48% of patients with OAC, GOJAC and OSCC, respectively. Less common symptoms were reflux, chest pain, bleeding and weight loss. All patients underwent endoscopy, most had a staging computed tomography scan (OAC 93%, GOJAC 95% and OSCC 93%), and about half had positron emission tomography scans (OAC 51%, GOJAC 44% and OSCC 42%). Pretreatment tumour stage was reported in 25% of records, and could be derived from results of investigations in a further 23%, but the remaining half lacked sufficient information to ascribe a pretreatment stage. Curative treatments were attempted for 60% of OAC, 88% of GOJAC and 65% of OSCC patients. Surgery was performed on 52% of OAC, 83% of GOJAC and 41% of OSCC patients. About two-thirds of surgical patients received additional therapies. CONCLUSIONS: With anticipated increases in oesophageal cancer incidence, the resources required to diagnose and manage patients with oesphageal cancer are also likely to rise. Our data provide a baseline from which to plan for the future care of patients with cancers of the oesophagus.",cancer
"Deaf children's engagement in an educational video in American Sign Language. Over time, children's educational television has successfully modified programming to incorporate research-based strategies to facilitate learning and engagement during viewing. However, research has been limited on whether these same strategies would work with preschool deaf children viewing videos in American Sign Language. In a descriptive study, engagement behaviors of 25 preschool deaf children during multiple viewings of an educational video in ASL were examined. The video incorporated research-based interactive strategies to facilitate engagement while targeting vocabulary through ASL, fingerspelling, and English print. Each of 3 viewing sessions was recorded; videos were transcribed and coded for frequency of children's movements, pointing, fingerspelling, and signing. Behaviors were analyzed for frequency within and across multiple viewings and by level of signing skills. It was found that each of these engagement behaviors occurred frequently throughout viewings and increased across multiple viewings regardless of a child's age or signing skills.",nocancer
"Analysis of clinical and molecular associations of triple negative breast cancers in node-negative patients. INTRODUCTION: Therapeutic modalities in node-negative breast cancer patients remain a matter of controversy. Various prognostic factors have been proposed to help select those patients that would most likely benefit from adjuvant therapy. In view of this notion the triple negative phenotype (hormone receptors and HER2 negative tumors) has gained increasing attention. AIM: To evaluate the clinicopathologic characteristics of triple negative (TN) tumors in node-negative invasive breast carcinomas. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the archival pathology tissues of 160 patients with node-negative invasive carcinomas, diagnosed and treated in two surgical departments in Greece from 1999 to 2006. Statistical analysis was used to examine the association between TN tumors and other clinicopathological factors. RESULTS: Triple negative breast cancers correlated with higher histologic grade, mitotic activation index and Ki-67 expression (p < 0.05). Moreover TN tumors were correlated with negative staining for bcl-2 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In node-negative breast cancer patients, triple negativity is associated with aggressive biologic behavior. Further studies are required to better understand the clinical implications of these findings.",cancer

DESIGN, SETTING AND PATIENTS: Assessment of indirectly standardised incidence and mortality ratios for Indigenous Australians in Queensland diagnosed with cancer from 1997 to 2006, compared with the total Queensland population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Standardised incidence and mortality ratios. RESULTS: Compared with the total Queensland population, Indigenous Queenslanders had a lower overall incidence of cancer (standardised incidence ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.75-0.82), but a higher incidence of some of the more fatal cancer types. Overall cancer mortality was higher (standardised mortality ratio, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.28-1.45) and similar to rates for Indigenous people in other Australian states. CONCLUSION: Cancer rates for Indigenous Queenslanders, a mostly urbanised population, are similar to rates for Indigenous Australians mostly living in remote areas.",cancer
"Improving the accuracy of pre-operative survival prediction in renal cell carcinoma with C-reactive protein. BACKGROUND: Validated objective biomarkers are needed for patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) to guide patient management and define high-risk populations for follow-up or for therapeutic purposes. METHODS: Patients undergoing nephrectomy for RCC (n=286 all stages, 84% with conventional clear cell type) were included with a median duration follow-up of 5 years. The prognostic significance of pre-operative haematological and biochemical variables, including C-reactive protein (CRP) values were examined and whether they added additional information to a recently published pre-operative scoring system was determined. RESULTS: C-reactive protein was the most significant predictor of overall survival (OS; chi(2)=50.9, P<0.001). Five-year OS for patients with CRP </= 15 mg l(-1) vs >15 mg l(-1) was 72% (95% CI 65-78%) and 33% (95% CI 23-44%), respectively. Similar results were seen for cancer-specific survival (CSS) and disease-free survival. On multivariate analysis, CRP remained highly significant for CSS (chi(2)=17.3, P<0.0001) and OS (chi(2)=9.8, P<0.002), in addition to other pre-operative variables including log of neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, red blood cell count and white cell count. C-reactive protein was significant in addition to the pre-operative nomogram score (chi(2)=12.5, P=0.0004 for OS, chi(2)=16.2, P=0.0001 for CSS and chi(2)=8.6, P=0.003 for DFS) and was still significant when other pre-operative variables were included. CONCLUSION: C-reactive protein and other haematological and biochemical variables have independent prognostic significance in RCC and may enhance pre-operative scoring systems.",cancer
"Brain tumors and epilepsy. Brain tumors are a common cause of epilepsy. Tumor type and location are determining factors that significantly influence seizure frequency. The aim of this study was to analyze clinical data of patients diagnosed with brain tumors and epilepsy. Data for this study were obtained from patient medical records over a 6-year period (2000-2005). Patient history and findings obtained by diagnostic methods such as electroencephalography, computerized tomography and magnetic resonance were analyzed. Data were analyzed by appropriate statistical methods and the structure, prevalence, mean and standard deviation were calculated. The significance of results was tested by use of t-test and chi2-test. A total of 15 933 patient charts were analyzed. Out of 15 933 patients, 10.8% were diagnosed with epilepsy and 175 (1.09%) patients had brain tumor, 75 (42.86%) of which were significantly associated with epilepsy (P > 0.05). Almost forty-three percent (42.86%) of tumors were epileptogenic, with no significant sex difference (confidence level of 95%). Fifty-seven (32.5%) brain tumor patients were aged 51-60. The mean age of all patients with brain tumors was 41.6 years. Focal sensorimotor seizures were dominant in 40 (53.3%) cases. Among epilepsy cases with known etiology, 75 (6.8%) patients had epileptogenic tumors. Types of seizures in patients with epilepsy were different from seizures provoked by brain tumors. The most common tumor site was temporal region (43.4%). There was no significant difference according to epileptogenesis. Focal sensorimotor seizures were common in patients with frontal and parietal region tumors.",cancer
"Are personality patterns and clinical syndromes associated with patients' motives and perceived outcome of orthognathic surgery? PURPOSE: A study of surgical-orthodontic patients was performed to assess whether signs of personality patterns and psychologically defined clinical syndromes influenced patients' motives for treatment, perceived oral function, self-concept, social interaction, and overall satisfaction with treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The sample consisted of 92 adult surgical-orthodontic patients. They filled out 3 questionnaires from Kiyak et al: one on motives for treatment; another on perceived oral function, self-concept, and social interaction; and a third on satisfaction with treatment outcome. The Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory III was used for classification of personality patterns and clinical syndromes. RESULTS: Patients with signs of a schizoid personality pattern expressed stronger presurgical motives than other patients. Concerning self-concept and social interaction, the patients showing signs of personality patterns and clinical syndromes, in general, perceived themselves as worse than the other patients. However, differences were only evident before treatment. Overall satisfaction was independent of the psychological profile. Histrionic and narcissistic personality patterns seemed to be overrepresented among surgical-orthodontic patients compared with the general population. CONCLUSION: Patients who showed signs of certain personality patterns and clinical syndromes improved most from treatment in terms of self-concept and social interaction, and such traits did not influence their degree of satisfaction.",nocancer
"Clinicopathological significance of p53, hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha, and vascular endothelial growth factor expression in colorectal cancer. BACKGROUND: The principal objective of this study was to evaluate the prognostic significances of p53, hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1alpha), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in colorectal cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The tumor tissues of 311 patients with colorectal carcinoma that had undergone potentially curative resections were immunohistochemically assessed using monoclonal antibodies against p53, HIF-1alpha, and VEGF. RESULTS: Positivity rates of p53, HIF-1alpha, and VEGF were 42.4%, 63.0%, and 56.6%, respectively. HIF-1alpha expression in tumor tissues was determined to be correlated significantly with the expression of VEGF (p=0.040), and depth of invasion (p=0.019). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that HIF-1alpha was independently associated with poor overall survival (p=0.002). CONCLUSION: HIF-1alpha expression is associated with VEGF expression and angiogenesis in colorectal carcinoma. Additionally, the expression of HIF-1alpha in tumor tissue is associated with angiogenesis and poor overall survival in patients with colorectal cancer.",cancer
"Apparent absence of a proton beam dose rate effect and possible differences in RBE between Bragg peak and plateau. PURPOSE: Respiration-gated irradiation for a moving target requires a longer time to deliver single fraction in proton radiotherapy (PRT). Ultrahigh dose rate (UDR) proton beam, which is 10-100 times higher than that is used in current clinical practice, has been investigated to deliver daily dose in single breath hold duration. The purpose of this study is to investigate the survival curve and relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of such an ultrahigh dose rate proton beam and their linear energy transfer (LET) dependence. METHODS: HSG cells were irradiated by a spatially and temporally uniform proton beam at two different dose rates: 8 Gy/min (CDR, clinical dose rate) and 325 Gy/min (UDR, ultrahigh dose rate) at the Bragg peak and 1.75 (CDR) and 114 Gy/min (UDR) at the plateau. To study LET dependence, the cells were positioned at the Bragg peak, where the absorbed dose-averaged LET was 3.19 keV/microm, and at the plateau, where it was 0.56 keV/microm. After the cell exposure and colony assay, the measured data were fitted by the linear quadratic (LQ) model and the survival curves and RBE at 10% survival were compared. RESULTS: No significant difference was observed in the survival curves between the two proton dose rates. The ratio of the RBE for CDR/UDR was 0.98 +/- 0.04 at the Bragg peak and 0.96 +/- 0.06 at the plateau. On the other hand, Bragg peak/plateau RBE ratio was 1.15 +/- 0.05 for UDR and 1.18 +/- 0.07 for CDR. CONCLUSIONS: Present RBE can be consistently used in treatment planning of PRT using ultrahigh dose rate radiation. Because a significant increase in RBE toward the Bragg peak was observed for both UDR and CDR, further evaluation of RBE enhancement toward the Bragg peak and beyond is required.",cancer
"Structure of the human dopamine D3 receptor in complex with a D2/D3 selective antagonist. Dopamine modulates movement, cognition, and emotion through activation of dopamine G protein-coupled receptors in the brain. The crystal structure of the human dopamine D3 receptor (D3R) in complex with the small molecule D2R/D3R-specific antagonist eticlopride reveals important features of the ligand binding pocket and extracellular loops. On the intracellular side of the receptor, a locked conformation of the ionic lock and two distinctly different conformations of intracellular loop 2 are observed. Docking of R-22, a D3R-selective antagonist, reveals an extracellular extension of the eticlopride binding site that comprises a second binding pocket for the aryl amide of R-22, which differs between the highly homologous D2R and D3R. This difference provides direction to the design of D3R-selective agents for treating drug abuse and other neuropsychiatric indications.",nocancer
"Management of diabetes in patients at the end of life. Diabetes is a complex metabolic disorder that is more common in patients with cancer than in the general population. The ethical dilemmas facing many healthcare professionals in the management of diabetes during the terminal phase of life include the timing of withholding or withdrawing treatment. Communication can also be difficult between healthcare professionals, patients and their families at this time. If the patient's preferences have not been discussed at an earlier stage in the illness trajectory, mismanagement of diabetes may occur. Local protocols on diabetes management at the end of life have been developed in some areas, but there are no national or standardised guidelines. This can result in fragmented care. This article explores the need for better communication and the development of national guidelines so that the quality of end of life care for patients with diabetes can be improved.",nocancer
"Repeatable battery for the assessment of neuropsychological status (RBANS) may be valid in men ages 18 to 201. The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) provides standardized scores for adults ages 20 to 89 years. However, there are situations in which the use of the RBANS for adults ages 18 to 20 years may be appropriate and have practical advantages. Thus, at present, an examiner who uses the RBANS for adult patients must rely on an entirely different evaluation tool for those adult patients under the age of 20 years. This preliminary investigation suggests the RBANS is a valid measure for men ages 18 to 20 years.",nocancer
"Use of proton-pump inhibitors in early pregnancy and the risk of birth defects. BACKGROUND: Symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux are common in pregnancy, but there are limited data on the risk of birth defects associated with exposure to proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) in early pregnancy. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study to assess the association between exposure to PPIs during pregnancy and the risk of major birth defects among all infants born alive in Denmark between January 1996 and September 2008. We linked data from nationwide registries, including individual-level information on exposure to PPIs (prescriptions), birth defects, and potential confounders. Major birth defects, diagnosed within the first year of life, were categorized according to the standardized classification scheme of the European surveillance of congenital anomalies (EUROCAT). Our primary analyses assessed the use of PPIs from 4 weeks before conception through 12 weeks of gestation and from 0 through 12 weeks of gestation (first trimester). RESULTS: Among 840,968 live births, 5082 involved exposure to PPIs between 4 weeks before conception and the end of the first trimester of pregnancy. There were 174 major birth defects in infants whose mothers had been exposed to PPIs during this period (3.4%), as compared with 21,811 in the group whose mothers had not been exposed (2.6%) (adjusted prevalence odds ratio, 1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05 to 1.44). In analyses limited to exposure during the first trimester, there were 118 major birth defects among 3651 infants exposed to PPIs (3.2%), and the adjusted prevalence odds ratio was 1.10 (95% CI, 0.91 to 1.34). The risk of birth defects was not significantly increased in secondary analyses of exposure to individual PPIs during the first trimester or in analyses limited to the offspring of women who had filled PPI prescriptions and received enough doses to have a theoretical chance of first-trimester exposure. CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort, exposure to PPIs during the first trimester of pregnancy was not associated with a significantly increased risk of major birth defects.

"Malaysian dental graduates' competence in holistic care: what do graduates and employers think? The purpose of this study was to explore the University of Malaya (UM) dental graduates' competence in holistic care in real settings from the employers' and graduates' perspectives. A self-administered questionnaire consisting of ten domains was sent to thirty senior dental officers of the Ministry of Health (MOH) and 164 UM graduates. In this article, nineteen major competencies that best represent the graduates' competence in the provision of holistic care are discussed. Each competency was rated on a scale of 1 (very poor) to 4 (very good) and was categorized as ""poor and of major concern"" (if less than 60 percent of respondents scored good or very good), ""satisfactory and of minor concern"" (60-69 percent), or ""excellent"" (70 percent and above). One hundred and six out of 164 graduates (64.6 percent) and twenty-nine out of thirty employers (96.7 percent) responded. Overall, the employers rated the graduates lower than what the graduates rated themselves on all items. While the graduates felt they were excellent and satisfactory in sixteen out of nineteen items (84.2 percent), the employers felt they were poor in fourteen out of nineteen (73.7 percent). Both groups agreed that the graduates were excellent in communication, but poor in life-saving skills, obtaining patient's family and psychosocial histories, and recognizing signs and symptoms (not intraoral) indicating the presence of a systemic disease. In conclusion, although the graduates felt competent in the majority of the holistic care competencies, the employers had some reservations over such claims. Outcomes of the study led to recommendations to incorporate longer community-based learning hours, an improved behavioral science component, a module for special care patients, and multidepartmental collaborative teachings in the new integrated program aimed for implementation in 2011.",nocancer
"The utility and cost of routine follow-up procedures in the surveillance of ovarian and primary peritoneal carcinoma: a 16-year institutional review. BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the number of ovarian cancer and primary peritoneal cancer (PPC) progressive disease cases identified via routine follow-up procedures and the corresponding cost throughout a 16-year period at a single medical institution. METHODS: Previously undiagnosed epithelial ovarian (n=241), PPC (n=23), and concurrent ovarian and uterine (n=24) cancer patients were treated and then followed via CA-125, imaging (e.g., CT scan, chest X-ray), physical examination and vaginal cytology. RESULTS: In the group of 287 patients, there were 151 cases of disease progression. Serial imaging detected the highest number of progressive disease cases (66 initial and 45 confirmatory diagnoses), but the cost was rather high ($13,454 per patient recurrence), whereas CA-125 testing (74 initial and 20 corroborative diagnoses) was the least expensive ($3,924) per recurrent diagnosis. The total cost of surveillance during the 16-year period was nearly $2,400,000. CONCLUSION: Ultimately, serial imaging and the CA-125 assay detected the highest number of ovarian cancer and PCC progressive disease cases in comparison to physical examination and vaginal cytology, but nevertheless, all of the procedures were conducted at a considerable financial expense.",cancer
"Nasal reconstruction in children with the combination of nasolabial and island flaps. BACKGROUND: The reconstruction of the nose is one of the most complicated aesthetic-reconstructive procedures. The difficulty of the procedure lies is in the necessity for reconstruction not only to capture the very complicated, various shapes of the nose but also to preserve the function of the nose: to allow the patient to breathe through the nose. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 12-year-old girl had loss injury of the part of left wing of the nostril. We used the compound nasolabial flap with a small excess to resolve the mucosal and skin defect. One year after the first operation relief of natural transition of the new wing of the nostril and cheek was created with small island flap. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The reconstruction of a wing of the nostril in multistage procedures with combined nasolabial flap and island flap allowed us to perform precise modelation of the nostril wing with the natural transition to the cheek. An island flap with its scars creates the required contour of a nostril wing and prevents the collapse and flattening of the nostril wing externally.",nocancer
"Mitochondrial fusion and fission in cell life and death. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that constantly fuse and divide. These processes (collectively termed mitochondrial dynamics) are important for mitochondrial inheritance and for the maintenance of mitochondrial functions. The core components of the evolutionarily conserved fusion and fission machineries have now been identified, and mechanistic studies have revealed the first secrets of the complex processes that govern fusion and fission of a double membrane-bound organelle. Mitochondrial dynamics was recently recognized as an important constituent of cellular quality control. Defects have detrimental consequences on bioenergetic supply and contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. These findings open exciting new directions to explore mitochondrial biology.",nocancer
"Is insulin-dependent diabetes and obesity a predisposition for endometrial and pancreatic carcinoma? Among 178 patients operated for endometrial carcinoma during a five-year period, 17 were re-operated at the Institute of Surgery (9.5%) because of pancreatic head carcinoma.

"Diverse phenotypic profile of uterine tumors resembling ovarian sex cord tumors: an immunohistochemical study of 12 cases. BACKGROUND: Uterine tumors resembling ovarian sex cord tumors (UTROSCTs) are rare neoplasms thought to be of putative endometrial stromal origin and solely composed of sex cord elements. Our study aimed to delineate the immunophenotype of these tumors and to verify whether their morphology reflects true sex cord-like differentiation. DESIGN: Representative paraffin blocks from 12 UTROSCTs were selected after confirmation of the diagnosis. Cords and/or trabeculae were seen in all tumors, whereas tubules, diffuse areas, and a retiform pattern were present in 9, 6, and 2 cases, respectively. Tumors were stained for sex cord (inhibin, calretinin, WT1, and melan-A), epithelial (KL1 and epithelial membrane antigen), and smooth muscle markers (smooth muscle actin, desmin, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, h-caldesmon, and histone deacetylase-8), CD10, HMB45, S100, and CD117. Intensity and percentage of staining were recorded. RESULTS: Six out of 12 tumors were positive for sex cord markers (inhibin 3 of 12, calretinin 4 of 12, WT1 4 of 12, and melan-A 3 of 11) with 4 tumors coexpressing more than one marker. Half of the UTROSCTs showed positivity for KL1, with 2 tumors coexpressing epithelial membrane antigen. All but one tumor expressed one or more smooth muscle markers, with smooth muscle actin, desmin and histone deacetylase-8 being most commonly expressed. CD10 was positive in 6 of 12 tumors, CD117 in 4 of 12, and S100 in 2 of 11 tumors, whereas HMB45 was negative in 11 tumors tested. CONCLUSIONS: UTROSCTs have a diverse immunohistochemical profile often coexpressing sex cord, epithelial, and smooth muscle markers. The expression of smooth muscle markers in these tumors does not imply a smooth muscle origin as endometrial and sex cord stromal tumors are not infrequently positive for these markers. Positivity for sex cord markers supports a true sex cord/steroid phenotype. Although the immunohistochemical profile of these tumors overlaps with that of endometrial stromal tumors with sex cord-like differentiation as well as ovarian sex cord stromal tumors, the origin of UTROSCT remains uncertain.",cancer
"Food consumption patterns of infants and toddlers: where are we now? OBJECTIVES: To describe current infant-feeding practices and current food group consumption patterns of infants and toddlers and to compare 2008 data with 2002 data to identify shifts in these practices and food consumption over time. DESIGN: The Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study (FITS) 2008 is a cross-sectional survey of a national random sample of US children from birth up to age 4 years. Data for three age subgroups (infants 4 to 5.9 months and 6 to 11.9 months and toddlers 12 to 23.9 months) were used from the 2002 (n=2,884) and 2008 surveys (n=1,596). STATISTICAL METHODS: All analyses use sample weights that reflect the US population aged 4 to 24 months. Descriptive statistics (means, proportions, and standard errors) and t tests were calculated using SUDAAN (release 9, 2005, Research Triangle Park Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC). RESULTS: These data show a higher percentage of infants receiving breast milk from 4 to 11.9 months of age with a concurrent decreasing percentage of infants receiving formula, which is significantly different from data for the 9- to 11.9-month-old age group. The use of complementary foods also appears to be delayed in FITS 2008: There is a significantly lower proportion of infants consuming infant cereal at 9 to 11.9 months in FITS 2008 compared to 2002 data. Fruit and vegetable consumption remains lower than desired. Significant reductions in the percentage of infants and toddlers consuming any desserts or candy, sweetened beverages, and salty snacks were seen in 2008. CONCLUSIONS: The findings presented here provide important insights to the content of messages and types of interventions that are still needed to improve the diets of infants and toddlers.",nocancer
"Application of varied measurement conditions in evaluation of plasters with local heating activity. The aim of our study was to compare the temperatures of selected heating pads in conditions similar to standard application, and in conditions of isolated pads applied on the area with impaired local circulation. The research was conducted for three kinds of preparations, accessible on the polish pharmaceutical market, encoded as pads I, II, and III, and stored due to the manufacturer guidelines. In the first phase study--in conditions mimicking the physiological situation, mean temperature value, after gaining plateau phase, was at the level of ca. 42.5 degrees C. The fast increase of temperature of I and II pads, followed after 10 and 15 minutes respectively. Also pad III presented similar increase of temperature. The data obtained in the second part of the experiment were different comparing to the thermostated model. High differences were recorded between pads I, II, and III. The I pads attained the maximum temperature after ca. 20-25 min, and the temperature was maintained on the level of 60-65 degrees C, and this is threated by immediate tissue damage after 5 sec. the application of heating pads in patients with proper local circulation, and when there is no additional isolation on the pad, seems to be safe and effective, however the complete evaluation of the product must be confirmed in ""in vivo"" conditions, e.g., with human volunteers.",nocancer
"An acute exercise session increases self-efficacy in sedentary endometrial cancer survivors and controls. BACKGROUND: Self-efficacy can be affected by mastery experiences and somatic sensations. A novel exercise experience and associated sensations may impact self-efficacy and subsequent behaviors. We investigated the effect of a single exercise session on self-efficacy for sedentary endometrial cancer survivors compared with sedentary women of a similar age, but with no cancer history. METHODS: Twenty survivors and 19 controls completed an exercise session performed as a submaximal cycle ergometry test. Sensations and efficacy were measured before and after exercise. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed. Regression models were used to determine predictors of self-efficacy and subsequent exercise. RESULTS: Self-efficacy increased for both survivors and controls, but survivors had a higher rate of increase, and the change predicted subsequent exercise. The association between exercise-related somatic sensations and self-efficacy differed between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: A novel exercise experience had a larger effect on self-efficacy and subsequent exercise activity for endometrial cancer survivors than controls. Somatic sensations experienced during exercise may differ for survivors, which may be related to the experience of having cancer. Understanding factors affecting confidence in novel exercise experiences for populations with specific cancer histories is of the utmost importance in the adoption of exercise behaviors.",cancer
"Two rare breast tumors in a small community hospital. Rhabdomyosarcoma and schwannoma are two of the rarer tumors seen in the surgical setting, and it is rarer still to see these tumors originate in the breast. Rhabdomyosarcoma has an incidence of only 250 cases a year in the United States; of these, more than 90% are seen in individuals 25 years and younger. To our knowledge, only 24 cases of primary breast schwannoma have been reported in the English literature to date. Here, we present the cases of two perimenopausal women who presented with a primary rhabdomyosarcoma and a primary schwannoma at a small community hospital in central Florida within a period of less than three years. These cases provide an interesting juxtaposition to the management of typical breast cancer. Through proper evaluation, such cases can be treated without need of referral to a tertiary center, despite the extreme rarity of their conditions.",cancer
"Oct4 expression in immature teratoma of the ovary: relevance to histologic grade and degree of differentiation. Immature teratoma of the ovary is an uncommon tumor comprising 1% of ovarian malignancies. The amount of immature neuroepithelium in the teratoma is an important prognostic factor. Although the current grading system based on this criterion is widely accepted, the biological significance of immature neuroepithelium is poorly understood. In this study, we used immunohistochemistry to evaluate the expression of Oct4 (also known as Oct3 or POU5F1), a transcription factor expressed in primordial germ cells and embryonic stem cells, along with that of PAX6, a transcription factor contributing to neurogenesis, and CD56, a known marker for tumors of neural origin, in 18 cases of pure immature teratoma of the ovary. Oct4 was expressed in the immature neuroepithelium of all 7 grade-3 cases and 2 grade-2 cases. It was not expressed in 4 grade-2 cases and all 5 grade-1 cases. These tumor cells lacked CD30 or alpha-fetoprotein expression, which supported the diagnosis of pure immature teratoma. PAX6 was expressed in the immature neuroepithelium of all immature teratomas, but not in Oct4-positive cells. CD56 was expressed in neural components of various maturities including PAX6-positive immature neuroepithelium, but not in Oct4-positive cells. These data suggest that the expression of these markers probably reflects the differentiation status of neural tissue in immature teratomas. The finding that Oct4 expression was exclusively detected in immature neuroepithelium of high-grade immature teratomas indicates that Oct4 might serve as a promising biomarker for the diagnosis of highly malignant cases of immature teratoma.",cancer

"Interval between neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and surgery for squamous cell carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus: does delayed surgery have an impact on outcome? OBJECTIVE: Aim of this study was to evaluate whether delayed surgery after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) affects postoperative outcomes in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the thoracic esophagus. BACKGROUND: Esophagectomy is usually recommended within 4 to 6 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant CRT. However, the optimal timing of surgery is not clearly defined. METHODS: A total of 129 consecutive patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer, treated between 1998 and 2007, were retrospectively analyzed using prospectively collected data. Patients were divided into 3 groups on the basis of timing to surgery: group 1, </=30 days (n = 17); group 2, 31 to 60 days (n = 83); and group 3, 61 to 90 days (n = 29). Subsequently, only 2-numerically more consistent-groups were studied, using the median value of timing intervals as a cutoff level: group A, </=46 days (n = 66); and group B, >46 days (n = 63). RESULTS: Groups were comparable in terms of patient and tumor characteristics, type of neoadjuvant regimen, toxicity, postoperative morbidity and mortality rates, tumor downstaging, and pathologic complete responses. The overall 5-year actuarial survival rate was 0% in group 1, 43.1% in group 2, and 35.9% in group 3 (P = 0.13). After R0 resection (n = 106), the 5-year actuarial survival rate was 0%, 51%, and 47.3%, respectively (P = 0.18). Tumor recurrence after R0 resection seemed to be inversely related, even if not significantly (P = 0.17), to the time interval between chemoradiation and surgery: 50% in group 1, 40.6% in group 2, and 21.7% in group 3. When considering only 2 groups, the overall 5-year survival was 33.1% in group A and 42.7% in group B (P = 0.64); after R0 resection, the 5-year survival was 37.8% and 56.3%, respectively (P = 0.18). The rate of tumor recurrence was significantly lower in group B (25%) than in group A (48.3%) (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Delayed surgery after neoadjuvant chemoradiation does not compromise the outcomes of patients with locally advanced SCC of the esophagus. Delaying surgery up to 90 days offers relevant advantages in the clinical management of the patients, can reduce tumor recurrences, and may improve prognosis after complete R0 resection surgery.",cancer
"The challenge of immunogenicity in the quest for induced pluripotency. Few advances have been so widely acclaimed in biology as the seminal demonstration that adult somatic cells can be induced to acquire the phenotype and differentiation potential of embryonic stem cells. The capacity to produce patient-specific stem cells that are truly pluripotent has raised prospects for the treatment of many degenerative diseases through replacement of the affected cell types. In the race to the clinic, however, questions surrounding the potential immunogenicity of such cells have been largely overlooked. Here, I explore the extent of the challenges ahead and suggest that the induction of tolerance to such cells will be crucial to the future success of induced pluripotency.",nocancer
"The diagnosis of norovirus infections in hospitalized children and adolescents with acute gastroenteritis: a study from Pilsen, Czech Republic. BACKGROUND: Norovirus-associated sporadic gastroenteritis is an important cause of illness in Western Europe. However, at present, little information on the role of norovirus in sporadic gastroenteritis in Central Europe is available. Our study aimed at providing an assessment of their significance in hospitalized children and adolescents with acute gastroenteritis using ELISA test at the time of their introduction. METHODS: A prospective hospital based study of the etiology of acute gastroenteritis was undertaken in a total of 618 patients (mean age 39.8 months, range 0-228), who were hospitalized at the Charles University Hospital in Pilsen. All subjects were monitored in six fragmented periods during the years 2003 and 2004, 2006 and 2007. Clinical and laboratory data were processed, norovirus antigens in stools were detected using the EIA kits IDEIA Norovirus, DakoCytomation. RESULTS: A norovirus infection was confirmed in 62 cases, i.e., 10.0% of all patients with acute gastroenteritis. Vomiting was the most common symptom, recorded in 95.2 % of all the patients with norovirus infection. No severe extragastrointestinal complications were detected. The average interval between initial symptoms and the beginning of hospitalization was considerably shorter in patients with norovirus infection (1.3 days) compared with patients with rotavirus infections (2.4 days). The frequency of Salmonella spp., rotavirus, Campylobacter spp. and enteric adenovirus was 15.4%, 11.2%, 3.9%, 3.6%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm the clinical importance of noroviruses as a causative agent of acute gastroenteritis in children and teenagers in the region of a Central European country. Identification of norovirus infection should be included in the routine screenings of sporadic cases of acute gastroenteritis.",nocancer
"The cost and consequences of proximal femoral fractures which require further surgery following initial fixation. We evaluated the cost and consequences of proximal femoral fractures requiring further surgery because of complications. The data were collected prospectively in a standard manner from all patients with a proximal femoral fracture presenting to the trauma unit at the John Radcliffe Hospital over a five-year period. The total cost of treatment for each patient was calculated by separating it into its various components. The risk factors for the complications that arose, the location of their discharge and the mortality rates for these patients were compared to those of a matched control group. There were 2360 proximal femoral fractures in 2257 patients, of which 144 (6.1%) required further surgery. The mean cost of treatment in patients with complications was pound18,709 ( pound2606.30 to pound60,827.10), compared with pound8610 ( pound918.54 to pound45,601.30) for uncomplicated cases (p < 0.01), with a mean length of stay of 62.8 (44.5 to 79.3) and 32.7 (23.8 to 35.0) days, respectively. The probability of mortality after one month in these cases was significantly higher than in the control group, with a mean survival of 209 days, compared with 496 days for the controls. Patients with complications were statistically less likely to return to their own home (p < 0.01). Greater awareness and understanding are required to minimise the complications of proximal femoral fractures and consequently their cost.",nocancer
"Model-based calculations of off-axis ratio of conic beams for a dedicated 6 MV radiosurgery unit. PURPOSE: Because the small-radius photon beams shaped by cones in stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) lack lateral electronic equilibrium and a detector's finite cross section, direct experimental measurement of dosimetric data for these beams can be subject to large uncertainties. As the dose calculation accuracy of a treatment planning system largely depends on how well the dosimetric data are measured during the machine's commissioning, there is a critical need for an independent method to validate measured results. Therefore, the authors studied the model-based calculation as an approach to validate measured off-axis ratios (OARs). METHODS: The authors previously used a two-component analytical model to calculate central axis dose and associated dosimetric data (e.g., scatter factors and tissue-maximum ratio) in a water phantom and found excellent agreement between the calculated and the measured central axis doses for small 6 MV SRS conic beams. The model was based on that of Nizin and Mooij [""An approximation of central-axis absorbed dose in narrow photon beams,"" Med. Phys. 24, 1775-1780 (1997)] but was extended to account for apparent attenuation, spectral differences between broad and narrow beams, and the need for stricter scatter dose calculations for clinical beams. In this study, the authors applied Clarkson integration to this model to calculate OARs for conic beams. OARs were calculated for selected cones with radii from 0.2 to 1.0 cm. To allow comparisons, the authors also directly measured OARs using stereotactic diode (SFD), microchamber, and film dosimetry techniques. The calculated results were machine-specific and independent of direct measurement data for these beams. RESULTS: For these conic beams, the calculated OARs were in excellent agreement with the data measured using an SFD. The discrepancies in radii and in 80%-20% penumbra were within 0.01 cm, respectively. Using SFD-measured OARs as the reference data, the authors found that the calculated OARs were more accurate than those measured with a microchamber or film dosimetry. CONCLUSIONS: The model produces sufficiently accurate conic beam dosimetric data that can be used to validate direct measurement results for such beams.",cancer
"The severity, extent and recurrence of necrotizing periodontal disease in relation to HIV status and CD4+ T cell count. South Africa ranks among the three countries with the highest prevalence of HIV infection in sub-Saharan Africa, with an estimated 29.5% of women attending antenatal clinics being infected. Necrotizing periodontal disease is a well recognized HIV-associated oral condition. The objective of this investigation was to determine a possible correlation between the extent, severity and treatment outcome of necrotizing periodontal disease in relation to a person's HIV status and CD4+ T cell count. Data from 105 consecutive patients presenting with necrotizing periodontal disease at an academic oral health centre in South Africa were analysed. All patients were provided with an opportunity to undergo voluntary counseling and testing for HIV infection, were treated for necrotizing periodontal disease and followed over a period of nine months. The mean age of the cohort was 28 years old (range 12 - 52). Of 98 (93.3%) patients unaware of their HIV serostatus at the initial visit, 59 (56.2%) consented to testing. In total 45 (42.9%) were HIV-seropositive with a mean CD4+ T cell count of 222.7 cells/microl and 14 (13.3%) were HIV-seronegative, with a significantly higher mean CD4+ T cell count of 830 cells/microl (Fisher's exact test, p < 0.001), while the status of 46 (43.8%) remained unknown. In 101 (96.2%) patients, > or = 5 tooth sites were affected, and in 27 (26%) > or = 4 mm of gingival tissue were affected. This study, which included HIV-seropositive, HIV-seronegative and persons of unknown HIV status, revealed no statistical evidence that HIV infection was associated with the extent, severity or relapse of necrotizing periodontal disease. No statistically significant association could be demonstrated between the extent, severity and recurrence of necrotizing periodontal disease and a CD4+ T cell count < or = 200 cells/microl among HIV-seropositive patients.",nocancer
"Adoption of medications in substance abuse treatment: priorities and strategies of single state authorities. Research has confirmed the effectiveness of medications, when used in conjunction with ongoing counseling, to treat substance abuse disorders. This article describes a national, mixed-methods research project designed to investigate single state authorities' (SSAs) perceptions of adoption of evidence-based practices in substance abuse treatment. Results are focused specifically on medication-assisted treatment, one of five evidence-based practices defined by the National Quality Forum. Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) is an important and effective part of comprehensive care options available to clients who are chronically ill with alcohol and other drug disorders. Despite mounting clinical evidence and increased availability, overall rates of implementation and sustained adoption of medications to treat addiction remain limited. The results illustrate that the SSA representatives who fund public treatment programs believe MAT is a priority and worthy of system-wide implementation. Current strategies utilized by SSAs to support the adoption of MAT are detailed, as are barriers to adoption and implementation.",nocancer
"Cavernous hemangioma of the orbital apex: pathogenetic considerations in surgical management. PURPOSE: To consider the pathogenesis and growth of cavernous hemangioma, particularly within the crowded orbital apex, in decisions regarding surgical indications, timing, and technique. DESIGN: A perspective based on analysis of the microanatomic relationships and growth potential of apical cavernous hemangiomas, with representative case studies illustrating management recommendations. METHODS: Analysis of microscopic findings in typical and vision-loss cases; review of tumor growth patterns as reported in observational and interventional studies; consideration of surgical approaches and reported functional outcomes. RESULTS: An ongoing, local hemodynamic imbalance may drive the proliferation of a cavernous hemangioma. Extension into neighboring tissue induces a fibrous capsule, which is continually reconstituted as the lesion expands, and which may incorporate visually critical structures in the confines of the apex. The extent of this microanatomic intimacy is not detectable preoperatively. The tumor's remaining growth potential at the time of diagnosis or following incomplete resection is not predictable. CONCLUSIONS: Patients without significant vision deficits should be observed for progression. Those with significant deficits or signs of progression should be offered timely surgery, with recognition of the risks. The surgical approach should be individualized based on macroanatomic relationships. The decision to intervene should not be a commitment to complete resection at any cost; intraoperative recognition of ""inoperable"" attachments may dictate modifications in order to preserve vision.",cancer

"Use of the Valsalva graft and long-term follow-up. OBJECTIVE: The Valsalva graft is a specifically designed Dacron graft that, on implantation and pressurization, generates pseudosinuses of Valsalva. We reviewed a multicenter experience of the reimplantation procedure with the Valsalva graft in patients with aneurysms involving the aortic root. METHODS: A total of 278 patients underwent valve-sparing aortic root replacement using the Valsalva graft at 4 different Italian cardiac surgery centers and were studied by clinical assessment and echocardiography. Of the 278 patients, 220 were men (79%), with a mean age of 56 +/- 15 years. Of the patients, 42 (15%) had Marfan syndrome, 31 (11%) had a bicuspid aortic valve, 13 (5%) had acute aortic dissection, and 136 (49%) had grade 3 or 4+ aortic insufficiency. Concomitant cardiac procedures were performed in 78 patients (28%). Additional aortic leaflet repair was necessary in 25 patients (9%). The mean crossclamp time was 120 +/- 27 minutes. RESULTS: There were 5 (1.8%) operative and 5 (1.8%) late deaths. The mean follow-up was 52 +/- 28 months (range, 2-112 months) and was 100% complete. The cumulative actuarial survival was 95.2% (268 patients). A total of 32 patients (11%) had grade 3 to 4+ aortic insufficiency, and 17 of these required late aortic valve replacement (range, 3-78 months). At 10 years of follow-up, the freedom from aortic valve reoperation rate was 91%, and the rate of freedom from residual aortic insufficiency not needing reoperation was 88%. CONCLUSIONS: The reimplantation type of valve-sparing procedure can be facilitated by the use of the Valsalva graft and can be performed with satisfactory perioperative and midterm results. How an optimal root reconstruction will affect the second decade of follow-up has yet to be determined.",nocancer

"Reelin and stk25 have opposing roles in neuronal polarization and dendritic Golgi deployment. The Reelin ligand regulates a Dab1-dependent signaling pathway required for brain lamination and normal dendritogenesis, but the specific mechanisms underlying these actions remain unclear. We find that Stk25, a modifier of Reelin-Dab1 signaling, regulates Golgi morphology and neuronal polarization as part of an LKB1-Stk25-Golgi matrix protein 130 (GM130) signaling pathway. Overexpression of Stk25 induces Golgi condensation and multiple axons, both of which are rescued by Reelin treatment. Reelin stimulation of cultured neurons induces the extension of the Golgi into dendrites, which is suppressed by Stk25 overexpression. In vivo, Reelin and Dab1 are required for the normal extension of the Golgi apparatus into the apical dendrites of hippocampal and neocortical pyramidal neurons. This demonstrates that the balance between Reelin-Dab1 signaling and LKB1-Stk25-GM130 regulates Golgi dispersion, axon specification, and dendrite growth and provides insights into the importance of the Golgi apparatus for cell polarization.",nocancer

"Association between general and central adiposity in childhood, and change in these, with cardiovascular risk factors in adolescence: prospective cohort study. OBJECTIVES: To examine the prospective associations between body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and fat mass in childhood and cardiovascular risk factors at age 15-16. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. PARTICIPANTS: 5235 children aged 9-12 at start of study. Main exposures BMI, waist circumference, and fat mass determined by dual energy x ray absorptiometry, assessed at age 9-12 and at age 15-16. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and concentrations of fasting glucose, insulin, triglycerides, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high density lipoprotein cholesterol assessed at age 15-16. RESULTS: In girls a 1 SD greater BMI at age 9-12 was associated with cardiovascular risk factors at age 15-16 in fully adjusted models: odds ratio 1.23 (95% confidence interval 1.10 to 1.38) for high systolic blood pressure (>/=130 mm Hg); 1.19 (1.03 to 1.38) for high concentration of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (>/=2.79 mmol/l); 1.43 (1.06 to 1.92) for high concentration of triglycerides (>/=1.7 mmol/l); 1.25 (1.08 to 1.46) for low concentration of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (<1.03 mmol/l); and 1.45 (1.22 to 1.73) for high concentration of insulin (>/=16.95 IU/l). Equivalent results in boys were 1.24 (1.13 to 1.37) for systolic blood pressure; 1.30 (1.07 to 1.59) for low density lipoprotein cholesterol; 1.96 (1.51 to 2.55) for triglycerides; 1.39 (1.22 to 1.57) for high density lipoprotein cholesterol, and 1.84 (1.56 to 2.17) for insulin. BMI was associated with high fasting glucose (>/=5.6 mmol/l) only in boys (1.18, 1.03 to 1.36). With these binary outcomes there was statistical evidence that associations differed between girls and boys for fasting glucose (P=0.03) and insulin (P<0.001). When risk factors were examined as continuous outcomes there was evidence for stronger associations of BMI with more adverse levels in boys than girls for fasting insulin, glucose, and triglyceride concentrations (all interaction P</=0.03). BMI, waist circumference, and fat mass were all strongly correlated with each other (r=0.89-0.94), and associations of the three with cardiovascular outcomes were of similar magnitude with statistical evidence of consistency in associations (all P>0.2 for heterogeneity). When waist circumference or fat mass or both were added to models including BMI they did not increase the variation in cardiovascular risk factors already explained by BMI and confounders alone. Girls who were overweight/obese at age 9-12 but were normal weight by 15-16 had similar odds of adverse levels of risk factors to those who were normal weight at both ages. In boys odds of high systolic blood pressure, high concentrations of triglycerides and insulin, and low concentrations of high density lipoprotein cholesterol remained higher in this group compared with those who were normal weight at both ages but were lower than in those who remained overweight/obese at both ages. CONCLUSIONS: Measurements of waist circumference or directly assessed fat mass in childhood do not seem to be associated with cardiovascular risk factors in adolescence any more strongly than BMI. Girls who favourably alter their overweight status between childhood and adolescence have cardiovascular risk profiles broadly similar to those who were normal weight at both time points, but boys who change from overweight to normal show risk factor profiles intermediate between those seen in boys who are normal weight at both ages or overweight at both ages.",nocancer
"Epithelioid variant of a pleomorphic liposarcoma displaying arborizing vascular arrangements on cytology smears: a case report of an interesting cytomorphologic pattern in an uncommon tumor. BACKGROUND: There is limited documentation on cytologic features of liposarcomas, especially pleomorphic liposarcomas (PLPSs), in view of their rarity. CASE: We present cytomorphologic features of an uncommon case of epithelioid variant of a PLPS appearing as a recurrent mass in a young adult man. Fine needle aspiration cytology smears displayed prominent arborizing vasculature with numerous lipoblasts with well-defined vacuolated cytoplasm, indenting the nuclei. In addition, mitoses were conspicuously noted. Biopsy from the scar recurrence and following wide excision showed a multinodular tumor with solid arrangement of tumor cells, separated by delicate vessels. Cells displayed well defined cytoplasmic borders, including several lipoblasts and focal areas of spindly sarcomatous differentiation. Typical and atypical mitoses were conspicuously seen and myxoid areas were absent. Immunohistochemistry showed diffuse positivity for vimentin and S-100; cytokeratin showed weak, focal cytoplasmic positivity. CD34 highlighted the delicate vasculature on tissue sections. Diagnosis of an epithelioid variant of a PLPS was finally offered. CONCLUSION: This rare case describes cytomorphologic features of an epithelioid variant of a PLPS, including prominent arborizing vasculature, a pattern that has invariably been described in a myxoid liposarcoma. Additionally, presence of numerous lipoblasts and mitoses led to the diagnosis of this rare variant.",cancer

GCSE is not a specific disease but is a manifestation of either a primary central nervous system (CNS) insult or a systemic disorder with secondary CNS effects. It is mandatory to look for an underlying cause. First-line therapies for seizures and status epilepticus include the use of a benzodiazepine, followed by an infusion of a phenytoin with a possible role for intravenous valproate or phenobarbital.

"Addressing the need for research on bariatric patient. During the past 3 decades numerous studies have documented the high prevalence of patient handling-related musculoskeletal injuries among healthcare workers and evaluated ergonomic interventions using mechanized equipment for lifting and moving patients. A great deal of research-based evidence now demonstrates the effectiveness of ergonomic interventions to reduce injury risk among healthcare workers who handle patients of average weights and sizes. In contrast, there is a lack of evidence-based research that evaluates ergonomic interventions for handling bariatric patients, whose extreme weights and sizes necessitate specialized handling equipment. The obesity epidemic, along with special medical and therapeutic concerns regarding bariatric patients, exacerbates healthcare workers' patient handling demands. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health is conducting a new study to evaluate bariatric patient handling hazards and interventions and identify evidence-based best practices for handling this population.",nocancer

Epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma in the hard palate: a case report. BACKGROUND: Epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma (EMC) is an uncommon salivary gland tumor. CASE: EMC arising from the minor salivary gland of the hard palate is very rare. A 70-year-old man presented with a nodular swelling in the hard palate. Fine needle aspiration cytology revealed biphasic epithelial (small cell) and myoepithelial (large/clear cell) clusters in a pseudopapillary and trabecular pattern. The cytology was reported as salivary gland neoplasm. The mass was excised and the histomorphology was suggestive of a low grade EMC. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated the biphasic nature of the tumor and confirmed the diagnosis of EMC. Follow-up for 2 years post surgery to date did not show any recurrence or metastases. CONCLUSION: Though exact cytologic typing of EMC was not possible; this case highlights the importance of awareness of this tumor in the differential diagnosis of biphasic tumors of the salivary gland.,cancer
"Coil embolization of intracranial aneurysms, the LSUHSC-S experience. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated and compared patient selection and outcome statistics during the first 18 months of the Louisiana State Health Sciences Center-Shreveport (LSUHSC-S) neurointerventional suite operation, specifically focusing on endovascular occlusion of intracranial aneurysms. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 67 patients with 68 cerebral aneurysms that were treated at the LSUHSC-S from July 2006 to December 2007 was conducted. All procedures were performed with the patients under general anesthesia and with systemic heparinization using live simultaneous roadmapping. The presence of residual aneurysmal filling was determined at the end of each procedure. RESULTS: A total of 67 patients underwent 70 endovascular coil embolization procedures for 68 intracranial aneurysms. Mean age of the patients was 51 years (range 15-89 years). There was a slight female preponderance (58.2% vs 41.8%). The vast majority of aneurysms undergoing coil embolization had ruptured (83.8%). Most were located in anterior circulation and (77.9%) were small (< 10 mm) in size (91.2%). Endovascular remodeling was attempted in 21 procedures (30%). Following embolization, complications were observed in 20 cases (28.6%). Though a greater proportion of complications occurred following procedures involving the posterior circulation, there was no statistical significance (p = 0.126, Chi-Square). Complete post-embolization occlusion was achieved with 33 aneurysms (47%). Near complete occlusion (> 90%) was seen in 65 (91.4%). There was no statistical association between location of the aneurysm and incomplete post procedure occlusion (p = 0.794, Chi-square). CONCLUSION: Our experience with coil embolization of intracranial aneurysms shows encouraging results and mirrors published rates of immediate post procedures near complete occlusion rates of approximately 90%.",nocancer
"The Indian type 2 diabetes risk score also helps identify those at risk of macrovasvular disease and neuropathy (CURES-77). AIMS: To see whether the diabetic individuals identified by the Indian Diabetes Risk Score (IDRS) also have a higher prevalence of diabetes related complications. METHODS: Type 2 diabetic subjects were selected from the Chennai Urban Rural Epidemiology Study in south India. Four field stereo retinal colour photography was done and diabetic retinopathy [DR] was classified according to Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study grading system. Coronary artery disease was diagnosed using Minnesota coding of 12-lead electrocardiograms. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) was diagnosed if vibratory perception threshold [VPT] of the right great toe measured by biothesiometry was > or =20. The criterion for diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) was an ankle-brachial index < 0.9. Macroalbuminuria was diagnosed if urinary albumin excretion was > or =300 microg/mg creatinine. A total of 1476 individuals who had information on all test parameters were included for analysis. RESULTS: Subjects with IDRS score > or =60 had significantly higher prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) [9.2% vs. 5.4%, p = 0.043], DPN [29.2% vs. 8.8%, p < 0.001] and PVD [4.8% vs. 1.9%, p = 0.038] compared to subjects with IDRS score <60. However, the prevalence of DR and macroalbuminuria did not differ between the two IDRS subgroups. Age explained much of the observed differences in prevalence of CAD, PVD and DPN between the two IDRS subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: This study further extends the clinical usefulness of IDRS to predicting diabetic complications like CAD, PVD and DPN as well.",nocancer
"Differences in attributions of mental illness and social distance for portrayals of four mental disorders. For individuals with mental illness, others' perceptions of mental illness often limit integration into communities. Perceptions of mental illness manifest as social stigma in the form of social distance and may depend on individuals' attributions of the origins of mental illness. 180 university students completed a survey on attribution of mental illness and social distance across several disorders (psychiatric and physical). Participants indicated greater social distance for severe mental illness (i.e., schizophrenia) than less severe mental illness and physical illness. More desire for social distance may be related to unfamiliarity with severe mental illness rather than less severe mental and physical illnesses. Greater understanding of how individuals perceive mental illness can inform efforts to educate the public.",cancer
"Glutaraldehyde mediated conjugation of amino-coated magnetic nanoparticles with albumin protein for nanothermotherapy. A novel bioconjugation of amino saline capped Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) was developed by applying glutaraldehyde as activator. Briefly, Fe3O4 MNs were synthesized by the chemical co-precipitation method. Surface modification of the prepared MNPs was performed by employing amino saline as the coating agent. Glutaraldehyde was further applied as an activation agent through which BSA was conjugated to the amino-coated MNPs. The structure of the BSA-MNs was confirmed by FTIR analysis. Physico-chemical characterizations of the BSA-MNPs, such as surface morphology, surface charge and magnetic properties were investigated by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), zeta-Potential and Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM), etc. Magnetic inductive heating characteristics of the BSA-MNPs were analyzed by exposing the MNPs suspension (magnetic fluid) under alternative magnetic field (AMF). The results demonstrate that BSA was successfully conjugated with amino-coated MNs mediated through glutaraldehyde activation. The nanoparticles were spherical shaped with approximately 10 nm diameter. Possessing ideal magnetic inductive heating characteristics, which can generate very rapid and efficient heating while upon AMF exposure, BSA-MNPs can be applied as a novel candidature for magnetic nanothermotherapy for cancer treatment. In vitro cytotoxicity study on the human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cells (HepG-2) indicates that BSA-MNP is an efficient agent for cancer nanothermotherapy with satisfied biocompatibility, as rare cytotoxicity was observed in the absence of AMF. Moreover, our investigation provides a methodology for fabrication protein conjugated MNPs, for instance monoclonal antibody conjugated MNPs for targeting cancer nanothermotherapy.",nocancer
"DNMT3A mutations in acute myeloid leukemia. BACKGROUND: The genetic alterations responsible for an adverse outcome in most patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are unknown. METHODS: Using massively parallel DNA sequencing, we identified a somatic mutation in DNMT3A, encoding a DNA methyltransferase, in the genome of cells from a patient with AML with a normal karyotype. We sequenced the exons of DNMT3A in 280 additional patients with de novo AML to define recurring mutations. RESULTS: A total of 62 of 281 patients (22.1%) had mutations in DNMT3A that were predicted to affect translation. We identified 18 different missense mutations, the most common of which was predicted to affect amino acid R882 (in 37 patients). We also identified six frameshift, six nonsense, and three splice-site mutations and a 1.5-Mbp deletion encompassing DNMT3A. These mutations were highly enriched in the group of patients with an intermediate-risk cytogenetic profile (56 of 166 patients, or 33.7%) but were absent in all 79 patients with a favorable-risk cytogenetic profile (P<0.001 for both comparisons). The median overall survival among patients with DNMT3A mutations was significantly shorter than that among patients without such mutations (12.3 months vs. 41.1 months, P<0.001). DNMT3A mutations were associated with adverse outcomes among patients with an intermediate-risk cytogenetic profile or FLT3 mutations, regardless of age, and were independently associated with a poor outcome in Cox proportional-hazards analysis. CONCLUSIONS: DNMT3A mutations are highly recurrent in patients with de novo AML with an intermediate-risk cytogenetic profile and are independently associated with a poor outcome.

"Tajikistan: health system review. The Health Systems in Transition (HiT) profiles are country-based reports that provide a detailed description of a health system and of policy initiatives in progress or under development. HiTs examine different approaches to the organization, financing and delivery of health services and the role of the main actors in health systems; describe the institutional framework, process, content and implementation of health and health care policies; and highlight challenges and areas that require more in-depth analysis. Tajikistan is undergoing a complex transition from a health system inherited from the Soviet period to new forms of management, financing and health care provision. Following independence and the consequences of the civil war, health funding collapsed and informal out-of-pocket payments became the main source of revenue, with particularly severe consequences for the poor. With the aim of ensuring equitable access to health care and formalizing out-of-pocket payments, the Ministry of Health developed a programme that encompassed a basic benefit package (also known as the guaranteed benefit package) for people in need and formal co-payments for other groups of the population. One of the main challenges for the future will be to reorient the health system towards primary care and public health rather than hospital-based secondary and tertiary care. Pilots of primary care reform, introducing per capita financing, are under way in three of the country's oblasts. There are marked geographical imbalances in health care resources and financing, favouring the capital and regional centres over rural areas. There are also significant inequities in health care expenditures across regions. The quality of care is another major concern, owing to the lack of investment in health facilities and technologies, an insufficient supply of pharmaceuticals, poorly trained health care workers, and a lack of medical protocols and systems for quality improvement.",nocancer
"Explaining variation in referral from primary to secondary care: cohort study. OBJECTIVES: To determine the extent to which referral for defined symptoms from primary care varies by age, sex, and social deprivation and whether any sociodemographic variations in referral differ according to the presence of national referral guidance and the potential of the symptoms to be life threatening. DESIGN: Cohort study using individual patient data from the health improvement network database in primary care. SETTING: United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: 5492 patients with postmenopausal bleeding, 23 121 with hip pain, and 101 212 with dyspepsia from 326 general practices, 2001-7. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Multivariable associations between odds of immediate referral for postmenopausal bleeding and age and social deprivation; hazard rates of referral for hip pain or dyspepsia and age, sex, and social deprivation. Analyses for dyspepsia were stratified for people aged less than and more than 55 years because referral guidance differs by age. RESULTS: 61.4% (3374/5492) of patients with postmenopausal bleeding, 17.4% (4019/23 121) with hip pain, and 13.8% (13 944/101 212) with dyspepsia were referred. The likelihood of referral for postmenopausal bleeding declined with increasing age: the adjusted odds ratio for patients aged 85 or more compared with those aged 55-64 was 0.39 (95% confidence interval 0.31 to 0.49). Patients aged 85 or more with hip pain were also less likely to be referred than those aged 55-64 (0.68, 0.57 to 0.81). Women were less likely than men to be referred for hip pain (hazard ratio 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.84 to 0.96). More deprived patients with hip pain or dyspepsia (if aged <55) were less likely to be referred. Adjusted hazard ratios for those in the most deprived Townsend fifth compared with the least deprived were 0.72 (95% confidence interval 0.62 to 0.82) and 0.76 (0.68 to 0.85), respectively. No socioeconomic gradient was evident in referral for postmenopausal bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: Inequalities in referral associated with socioeconomic circumstances were more likely to occur in the absence of both explicit guidance and potentially life threatening conditions, whereas inequalities with age were evident for all conditions.",nocancer
"Deferral patterns of voluntary blood donors at the National Blood Transfusion Service, North East Zonal Centre, Maiduguri. Appropriate donor selection in an important step in ensuring safe supply of blood and blood products. In this study deferral patterns of voluntary non-renumerated blood donors were determined at the North-Eastern Zonal Centre of the National Blood Transfusion service. The study was conducted between April 2007 and April 2009, and it involved the administration of a structured questionnaire. A total of 4032 voluntary blood donors were recruited, seven hundred and thirteen (17.7%) were temporarily deferred. The commonest reasons for deferral were low haemoglobin, self-deferral, high blood pressure, low weight and high risk behaviour. Other reasons are use of certain medications, low blood pressure and failed venopuncture. Gender analysis showed that more females were deferred for low haemoglobin and more males were self-deferred. Following donor recall, 146 of the 173 donors temporarily deferred came back to donate. These consisted of 113 deferral due to low haemoglobin, 30 self-deferred and 3 induced in risky behaviour. Effective education or counseling, the old tradition of giving haematinics and good dietary advice to those with low haemaglobin values, improved the safety and availability of blood and blood products. Donors who are self-deferred and those involved in high risk bahviour should never be persuaded to donate blood.

Process improvement strategies provide industries with a method for improving outcomes and performance at a low cost and with minimal training. In Los Angeles County, two process improvement projects were implemented as a way to improve access to, and engagement and retention in, alcohol and other drug abuse treatment. A qualitative evaluation was completed after the Phase II pilot project to assess how the providers felt about the project, what worked, what did not work, what was learned, and the degree to which process improvements changed program operations. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 33 individuals, representing every level of staff participation in the project. Overall, comments indicated a positive experience for staff, administrators, and clients. Providers noted the relative ease of implementation and how quickly changes resulted in impressive improvements. Challenging issues included resistant staff or a lack of additional resources to pay for the project; however, most noted that these issues were resolved. Interview participants also requested more training on data collection and a reduction in the frequency of the project conference calls. This study gives support to the idea of process improvement being a tool that dramatically improves services to consumers of addiction treatment services.",nocancer
"Earlier diagnosis of bone and soft-tissue tumours. Although bone and soft-tissue sarcomas are rare, early diagnosis and prompt referral to a specialised unit offers the best chance of a successful outcome both in terms of survival and surgical resection. This paper highlights the clinical and radiological features that might suggest the possibility of a bone or soft-tissue sarcoma and suggests a succinct management pathway for establishing whether a suspicious bone or soft-tissue lesion could be malignant.",cancer
"Anti-CTLA-4 antibody therapy: immune monitoring during clinical development of a novel immunotherapy. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen (CTLA-4), also known as CD152, is a co-inhibitory molecule that functions to regulate T-cell activation. Antibodies that block the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands B7.1 and B7.2 can enhance immune responses, including antitumor immunity. Two CTLA-4-blocking antibodies are presently under clinical investigation: ipilimumab and tremelimumab. CTLA-4 blockade has shown promise in treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma, with a recently completed randomized, double-blind phase III trial demonstrating a benefit in overall survival (OS) in the treated population. However, this approach appears to benefit only a subset of patients. Understanding the mechanism(s) of action of CTLA-4 blockade and identifying prognostic immunologic correlates of clinical endpoints to monitor are presently areas of intense investigation. Several immunologic endpoints have been proposed to correlate with clinical activity. This review will focus on the endpoints of immune monitoring described in studies to date and discuss future areas of additional work needed.",cancer
"Simulation-based examinations in physician assistant education: A comparison of two standard-setting methods. PURPOSE: this study explored the reliability of two simple standard-setting methods that are used to set passing standards for a standardized patient (SP) exam in physician assistant (PA) education. METHODS: fifty-four second-year PA students participated in a multistation SP-based clinical skills exam. Cut scores were set using the Angoff and Borderline Group methods. A panel of PA faculty set cut scores using the Angoff method. A modified version of the Borderline Group method set cut scores using SP global ratings verified by faculty review. Inter-rater reliability between judges was evaluated using kappa coefficient (k) for the Angoff method and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for the Borderline Group method. RESULTS: the Borderline Group method set an overall cut score for the exam of 76% (95% CI +/- 5) and the Angoff method set a cut score at 62% (95% CI +/- 9). Both methods demonstrated sufficient inter-rater reliability (k 0.60, ICC > 0.70; both significant at p < 0.05), although one case (preop history and physical) demonstrated poor inter-rater reliability between judges using the Borderline Group method. DISCUSSION: the Borderline Group method offered a slightly more reliable cut score when compared to the standard set by the Angoff method, but was more challenging to implement. In addition, one case demonstrated poor inter-rater reliability with the Borderline Group method. Using SPs to complete global borderline ratings offers one solution to make the Borderline Group method more feasibile, but requires a high degree of initial rater calibration and periodic measures of interrater reliability between faculty and SPs.",nocancer
"Single port laparoscopically assisted hysterectomy with the TriPort system. A case report and review of the literature. AIM: We report our recent experience with the TriPort system (trademark of Advanced Surgical Concepts, Wicklow, Ireland) to perform a laparoscopically assisted hysterectomy via a single periumbilical incision. CASE REPORT: A 48-year-old multiparous woman was referred to us on March 2009 because of menometrorrhagia and uterine fibroids. RESULTS: The procedure was performed without intraoperative complications. The weight of the uterus was 360 gr. At the 10 months follow-up the patient did not refer any problem. DISCUSSION: Although our experience represented a potentially difficult surgery because of the size of the uterus, severe adhesions (two previous caesarean sessions) and the lack of experience with the new system, the procedure demonstrated to be feasible. As for our knowledge the present report represents the first case of single port laparoscopically assisted hysterectomy performed with the TriPort system in Italy. CONCLUSION: Single port laparoscopy is feasible and could potentially decrease postoperative pain as well as increase patient satisfaction. Although the early experience with TriPort system is promising, experienced laparoscopic skills are essential for the safe and effective performing of the procedure.",cancer
"Causal relationship between exposure to chemicals and malignant melanoma? A review and study proposal. Malignant melanoma (MM) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The MM-related incidence and mortality have been increasing at an alarming rate over at least the past four decades. Malignant melanoma has been thought to be related mainly to exposure to the sun or UV radiation. A review of the scientific literature reveals many significant correlations between chemical exposure in the workplace and the occurrence of malignant melanoma, particularly in cutaneous areas that have never been exposed to sunlight. Discrepant findings are reported by independent studies concluding that MM is causally related to employment-related chemical exposures and to investigators with industry affiliations. More studies are needed to define a correlation of chemical exposure as a co-factor on the pathogenesis in some melanoma patients. We propose further investigation by dermatologists working in Melanoma Centers, using a simple questionnaire on chemical exposure among patients, that have previously been diagnosed and are followed up for melanoma comparing with appropriate matched controls. Collecting the data and results from the questionnaire will help us understand the initiation events in melanoma and prevention health issues.",cancer
"Origins of cardiac fibroblasts. Cardiac fibroblasts play a critical role in maintenance of normal cardiac function. They are indispensable for damage control and tissue remodeling on myocardial injury and principal mediators of pathological cardiac remodeling and fibrosis. Despite their manyfold functions, cardiac fibroblasts remain poorly characterized in molecular terms. Evidence is evolving that cardiac fibroblasts are a heterogeneous population and likely derive from various distinct tissue niches in health and disease. Here, we review our emerging understanding of where cardiac fibroblasts come from, as well as how we can possibly use this knowledge to develop novel therapies for cardiac fibrosis.",nocancer
"Inhibition of Notch signaling reduces the stem-like population of breast cancer cells and prevents mammosphere formation. BACKGROUND: Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are believed to be responsible for breast cancer formation and recurrence; therefore, therapeutic strategies targeting CSCs must be developed. One approach may be targeting signaling pathways, like Notch, that are involved in stem cell self-renewal and survival. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Breast cancer stem-like cells derived from cell lines and patient samples were examined for Notch expression and activation. The effect of Notch inhibition on sphere formation, proliferation, and colony formation was determined. RESULTS: Breast cancer stem-like cells consistently expressed elevated Notch activation compared with bulk tumor cells. Blockade of Notch signaling using pharmacologic and genomic approaches prevented sphere formation, proliferation, and/or colony formation in soft agar. Interestingly, a gamma-secretase inhibitor, MRK003, induced apoptosis in these cells. CONCLUSION: Our findings support a crucial role for Notch signaling in maintenance of breast cancer stem-like cells, and suggest Notch inhibition may have clinical benefits in targeting CSCs.",cancer
"Biomarkers discovery in cancer--up-dates in methodology. Biomarkers are biomolecules that can indicate normal/pathological processes, or physiological responses to therapy. Due to the serum abundance in proteins, such as albumin and lypo/glycoproteins, biomarkers are difficult to assess. Serum biomarkers identification can contribute to personalized medicine and improve cancer diagnostic and prognostic. The paper summarizes some of the proteomics techniques and the workflow used for protein signatures identification associated to cancer development. Thus, biomarkers validated for prostatic, breast, cervical or lung cancers are presented as examples for clinical application of serum markers. In spite of the continuous research efforts, there are only few validated biomarkers that have proved a good predictive power in cancer. Modern technology and the combination of various techniques used for proteins quantification represent important means for the identification and validation of new biomarkers.",cancer
"Update: outbreak of cholera ---Haiti, 2010. The first cholera outbreak in Haiti in at least a century was confirmed by the Haitian National Public Health Laboratory on October 21, 2010. Surveillance data through December 3, provided by the Haitian Ministry of Public Health and Population (MSPP), indicated that the outbreak had spread nationwide and that cases of cholera and cholera-associated hospitalizations and deaths had climbed rapidly in November. As of December 3, MSPP reported 91,770 cases of cholera from all 10 departments and the capital city of Port-au-Prince; 43,243 (47.1%) patients had been hospitalized, and 2,071 (2.3%) had died. A rapid mortality assessment in Artibonite Department found that deaths occurred as rapidly as 2 hours after symptom onset and identified important gaps in access to life-saving treatments, including oral rehydration solution (ORS). Urgent activities are under way, and additional efforts are imperative to reduce cholera mortality by expanding access to cholera treatment and to reduce cholera transmission by improving access to safe water and adequate sanitation.",nocancer
"Working in partnership with the voluntary sector: early explorer clinics. The first three years of life have been identified as key to promoting children's later wellbeing, and partnership working across the statutory and voluntary sectors has been proposed as one of the best ways to meet the needs of families. Child health clinics are attended by parents seeking reassurance or help and advice from a health professional regarding child health and development. They have been used in Oxford to develop Early Explorer clinics, in which the statutory health visiting service and voluntary sector Peers Early Education Programme work together with the aim of improving outcomes for children and families. These Early Explorer clinics provide the opportunity to engage parents in supporting their child's development through interaction and non-directed exploratory play. They also offer opportunities to identify vulnerable families, who are provided with additional support. This paper examines a model of partnership working between statutory and voluntary sectors aimed at maximising opportunities to promote the health and wellbeing of infants and their families.",nocancer
"Chemoprevention by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs eliminates oncogenic intestinal stem cells via SMAC-dependent apoptosis. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as sulindac effectively prevent colon cancer in humans and rodent models. However, their cellular targets and underlying mechanisms have remained elusive. We found that dietary sulindac induced apoptosis to remove the intestinal stem cells with nuclear or phosphorylated beta-catenin in APC(Min/+) mice. NSAIDs also induced apoptosis in human colonic polyps and effectively removed cells with aberrant Wnt signaling. Furthermore, deficiency in SMAC, a mitochondrial apoptogenic protein, attenuated the tumor-suppressive effect of sulindac in APC(Min/+) mice by blocking apoptosis and removal of stem cells with nuclear or phosphorylated beta-catenin. These results suggest that effective chemoprevention of colon cancer by NSAIDs lies in the elimination of stem cells that are inappropriately activated by oncogenic events through induction of apoptosis.",cancer
"The emergency department evaluation of the adult patient who presents with a first-time seizure. Up to 5% of the population will experience at least 1 nonfebrile seizure at some point during their lifetime. The management of a patient who has had a first-time seizure is driven by the history and physical examination. In almost one-half of these patients, the cause of their seizure is not identified. In general, patients with comorbidities, a focal neurologic examination, or who have not returned to a normal baseline mental status require an extensive diagnostic evaluation including a noncontrast head computed tomography (CT) scan in the emergency department (ED). Adults with a first-time seizure, with no comorbidities, and who have returned to a normal baseline require only serum glucose and electrolyte determination. Women of reproductive age also require a pregnancy test. Patients with a normal neurologic examination, normal laboratory results, and no signs of structural brain disease do not require hospitalization or antiepileptic medications. Initiation of antiepileptic therapy depends on the assessed risk for recurrence, in conjunction with a neurologist consultation.",nocancer
"The crossover of bisphosphonates to cancer therapy. Bisphosphonates form a class of drugs commonly used to treat disorders of osteoclastic bone resorption, including osteoporosis, Paget's disease of the bone, rheumatoid arthritis, and bone metastases. Although long established as the therapy of choice to treat such disorders, bisphosphonates' potential in treating cancer is garnering interest. Bisphosphonates have been demonstrated to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis, induce apoptosis in tumor cells, and encourage immune reactions against tumor cells. Current applications of bisphosphonates in cancer treatment include their use to treat skeletal metastases and as an adjuvant to endocrine therapy. This review explores bisphosphonates' current clinical utility and potential as a crossover cancer therapy.",cancer
"Preferential killing of cancer cells using silicon carbide quantum dots. Silicon carbide quantum dots are highly luminescent biocompatible nanoparticles whose properties might be of particular interest for biomedical applications. In this study we investigated Silicon Carbide Quantum Dots (3C-SiC QDs) cellular localisation and influence on viability and proliferation on oral squamous carcinoma (AT-84 and HSC) and immortalized cell lines (S-G). They clearly localize into the nuclei, but the presence of 3C-SiC QDs in culture medium provoke morphological changes in cultured cells. We demonstrate that 3C-SiC QDs display dose- and time-dependent selective cytotoxicity on cancer versus immortalized cells in vitro. Since one of the limitations of classical antineoplastic drugs is their lack of selectivity, these results open a new way in the search for antiproliferative drugs.",cancer
"Reassessing the standard of care in indolent lymphoma: a clinical update to improve clinical practice. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) represents a diverse group of hematologic malignancies originating in B or T lymphocytes. Approximately 85% of NHLs are of B-cell origin, with the remainder mostly of T-cell origin. The most common NHL types are diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (31%) and follicular lymphoma (22%). More than 65,000 new cases of NHL develop each year, and approximately 20,000 people with NHL died of the disease 2009. NHL is the seventh most common cancer in the United States, contributes to approximately 4% to 5% of all cancer cases in the United States, and causes approximately 3% of all cancer-related deaths. Currently, nearly 500,000 people are living with the disease or are in remission. Several new and encouraging advances have been made in the treatment of indolent NHL. Although the watch and wait approach still has a role, combined immunochemotherapy remains the standard of care for both first-line and relapsed/refractory disease. As front-line treatment, bendamustine plus rituximab may become a new standard of care, especially for older patients. In contrast, rituximab in combination with chemotherapy followed by rituximab maintenance seems to be the optimal option in patients with relapsed disease.",cancer
"Insulin metabolism and the risk of Alzheimer disease: the Rotterdam Study. OBJECTIVE: Diabetes mellitus has been associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer disease (AD), but how it exerts its effect remains controversial. Possible pathophysiologic mechanisms are glucose toxicity and a direct effect of insulin on amyloid metabolism. Most studies had short follow-up, and longer-term effects of diabetes on AD risk are unknown. We investigated whether fasting glucose and insulin levels and insulin resistance are associated with the risk of AD and whether this risk is constant over time. METHODS: The study was based on 3,139 participants of the Rotterdam Study, a population-based cohort study. All subjects were free from dementia, did not have a history of diabetes, and had fasting levels of glucose and insulin measured at baseline. Insulin resistance was estimated with the homeostasis model assessment. We investigated how fasting glucose, insulin, and insulin resistance are related to the risk of AD in 3 different strata according to time-to-event, using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: During follow-up, 211 participants developed AD, 71 of them within 3 years of baseline. Levels of insulin and insulin resistance were associated with a higher risk of AD within 3 years of baseline. After 3 years, the risk was no longer increased. Glucose was not associated with a higher risk of AD. There was no interaction of APOE epsilon4 carriership and insulin metabolism on the risk of AD. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that insulin metabolism influences the clinical manifestation of AD only within 3 years.",nocancer
"The efficacy of chemical adjuvants on giant-cell tumour of bone. An in vitro study. Various chemicals are commonly used as adjuvant treatment to surgery for giant-cell tumour (GCT) of bone. The comparative effect of these solutions on the cells of GCT is not known. In this study we evaluated the cytotoxic effect of sterile water, 95% ethanol, 5% phenol, 3% hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and 50% zinc chloride (ZnCI(2)) on GCT monolayer tumour cultures which were established from six patients. The DNA content, the metabolic activity and the viability of the cultured samples of tumour cells were assessed at various times up to 120 hours after their exposure to these solutions. Equal cytotoxicity to the GCT monolayer culture was observed for 95% ethanol, 5% phenol, 3% H(2)O(2) and 50% ZnCI(2). The treated samples showed significant reductions in DNA content and metabolic activity 24 hours after treatment and this was sustained for up to 120 hours. The samples treated with sterile water showed an initial decline in DNA content and viability 24 hours after treatment, but the surviving cells were viable and had proliferated. No multinucleated cell formation was seen in these cultures. These results suggest that the use of chemical adjuvants other than water could help improve local control in the treatment of GCT of bone.",cancer
"Crystal structures of RNase H2 in complex with nucleic acid reveal the mechanism of RNA-DNA junction recognition and cleavage. Two classes of RNase H hydrolyze RNA of RNA/DNA hybrids. In contrast to RNase H1 that requires four ribonucleotides for cleavage, RNase H2 can nick duplex DNAs containing a single ribonucleotide, suggesting different in vivo substrates. We report here the crystal structures of a type 2 RNase H in complex with substrates containing a (5')RNA-DNA(3') junction. They revealed a unique mechanism of recognition and substrate-assisted cleavage. A conserved tyrosine residue distorts the nucleic acid at the junction, allowing the substrate to function in catalysis by participating in coordination of the active site metal ion. The biochemical and structural properties of RNase H2 explain the preference of the enzyme for junction substrates and establish the structural and mechanistic differences with RNase H1. Junction recognition is important for the removal of RNA embedded in DNA and may play an important role in DNA replication and repair.",nocancer
"Fixation of mandible fractures: a simplified method. INTRODUCTION: Many mandible fractures can be treated effectively with closed methods. The authors describe a simple method, with the use of commercial cable ties, to obtain maxillary-mandibular fixation (MMF). This technique can be effectively employed to treat certain mandible fractures. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: A simple, safe and cost-effective method for treating mandible fractures by employing commercial cable ties to obtain MMF was developed. A clinical prospective study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of this technique. METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients were enrolled into this study. MMF was obtained with cable ties. The study group was evaluated according to occlusion, clinical outcome, discomfort level and complications. RESULTS: Ninety percent of patients had normal occlusion after treatment. All fractures were clinically united. Seventy percent described their discomfort level as moderate during placement of the cable ties. The majority of patients experienced minimal discomfort both during MMF (95%), and with the removal of the cable ties (90%). No major complications occurred. Early loosening of MMF occurred in three patients with resultant subjective malocclusion in two of these. CONCLUSIONS: Employing commercial cable ties to obtain MMF for the treatment of certain mandible fractures is safe, simple, effective and cost-effective.",nocancer
"Chronic care and addictions treatment: a feasibility study on the implementation of posttreatment continuing recovery monitoring. In the treatment of drug addiction, as with other chronic conditions, the effects of treatment are significant but not long lasting after discharge unless continuing monitoring is provided. Efforts to help patients sustain positive treatment outcomes are generally directed to community support. Postdischarge checkups can help patients evaluate their behavior and recovery-related issues--similar to a person with diabetes reporting on blood sugar levels and diet and exercise patterns. The challenge for providers is to raise awareness of the importance of continuing recovery monitoring and the responsibility of the treatment program to build a more seamless continuum of care for patients who have completed a primary treatment episode. This article reviews a pilot project of the Department of Alcohol & Drug Services of Santa Clara County, California that tested the feasibility of implementing a continuing recovery monitoring (CRM) service using post-discharge telephone check-ups for volunteer patients (N=32) who completed treatment. The aims of the study were to (a) develop a model for continuing recovery monitoring, (b) gather data on the model's utility including identifying organizational and logistical challenges and, (c) describe several changes needed in the system of care to add CRM. The study showed that the model of continuing recovery monitoring is a feasible way to extend a system's existing continuum of care.",nocancer

The review provides evidence of variation in the mutational spectrum of the SRD5A2 gene leading to population-specific high prevalence of characteristic disease or phenotypic expression.",cancer
"Subclinical thyroid dysfunction and incident hip fracture in older adults. BACKGROUND: Subclinical thyroid dysfunction is common in older adults and affects bone metabolism, but its effects on fracture risk have not been reported. We sought to determine prospectively whether older men and women with subclinical hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism have an increased risk of hip fracture. METHODS: Prospective cohort of 3567 US community-dwelling adults, 65 years or older, with biochemically defined subclinical thyroid dysfunction or euthyroidism was enrolled from June 10, 1989, through May 30, 1990, and followed up through 2004. Main outcome measures included incidence and hazard ratios (HRs), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), of confirmed incident hip fractures for groups with subclinical hypothyroidism, subclinical hyperthyroidism, and euthyroidism as defined at baseline. RESULTS: During 39 952 person-years (median follow-up, 13 years), hip fracture incidence (per 1000 men-years) was 13.65 in men with subclinical hyperthyroidism (n = 29) and 10.27 in men with subclinical hypothyroidism (n = 184), both greater than 5.0 in men with euthyroidism (n = 1159). Men with subclinical hypothyroidism had a multivariable-adjusted HR of 2.31 (95% CI, 1.25-4.27); those with subclinical hyperthyroidism, 3.27 (0.99-11.30). After excluding those with baseline use of thyroid-altering medications, men with endogenous subclinical hyperthyroidism had a higher HR of 4.91 (95% CI, 1.13-21.27), as did men with endogenous subclinical hypothyroidism (2.45, 1.27-4.73). Hip fracture incidence (per 1000 women-years) was 8.93 in women with subclinical hypothyroidism (n = 359) and 10.90 in women with subclinical hyperthyroidism (n = 142) compared with 10.18 in women with euthyroidism (n = 1694). No clear association between subclinical dysfunction and fracture was observed in women. CONCLUSIONS: Older men with subclinical hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism are at increased risk for hip fracture. Whether treatment of the subclinical syndrome reduces this risk is unknown.",nocancer

"Active surveillance compared with initial treatment for men with low-risk prostate cancer: a decision analysis. CONTEXT: In the United States, 192,000 men were diagnosed as having prostate cancer in 2009, the majority with low-risk, clinically localized disease. Treatment of these cancers is associated with substantial morbidity. Active surveillance is an alternative to initial treatment, but long-term outcomes and effect on quality of life have not been well characterized. OBJECTIVE: To examine the quality-of-life benefits and risks of active surveillance compared with initial treatment for men with low-risk, clinically localized prostate cancer. DESIGN AND SETTING: Decision analysis using a simulation model was performed: men were treated at diagnosis with brachytherapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), or radical prostatectomy or followed up by active surveillance (a strategy of close monitoring of newly diagnosed patients with serial prostate-specific antigen measurements, digital rectal examinations, and biopsies, with treatment at disease progression or patient choice). Probabilities and utilities were derived from previous studies and literature review. In the base case, the relative risk of prostate cancer-specific death for initial treatment vs active surveillance was assumed to be 0.83. Men incurred short- and long-term adverse effects of treatment. PATIENTS: Hypothetical cohorts of 65-year-old men newly diagnosed as having clinically localized, low-risk prostate cancer (prostate-specific antigen level <10 ng/mL, stage </=T2a disease, and Gleason score </=6). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE). RESULTS: Active surveillance was associated with the greatest QALE (11.07 quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]), followed by brachytherapy (10.57 QALYs), IMRT (10.51 QALYs), and radical prostatectomy (10.23 QALYs). Active surveillance remained associated with the highest QALE even if the relative risk of prostate cancer-specific death for initial treatment vs active surveillance was as low as 0.6. However, the QALE gains and the optimal strategy were highly dependent on individual preferences for living under active surveillance and for having been treated. CONCLUSIONS: Under a wide range of assumptions, for a 65-year-old man, active surveillance is a reasonable approach to low-risk prostate cancer based on QALE compared with initial treatment. However, individual preferences play a central role in the decision whether to treat or to pursue active surveillance.",cancer
"A survey of senior dental students' experiences with young dental patients in Pennsylvania. The purpose of this study was to determine graduating dental students' perceptions about their training and experience in examination and treatment of infants and their plans to examine infants upon graduation. A survey was distributed to dental students graduating from Pennsylvania dental schools in 2007 and 2008. Of the returned surveys, 47.9 percent correctly identified 12 months as the recommended age for the first dental exam. Sixty-five percent of responders felt they would be comfortable performing exams on young children. This study's primary objective was to test the association between performance of a clinical exam in a young child, enjoyment of clinical and didactic pediatric dental experience, plans for additional training in pediatric dentistry and willingness to see children younger than two years old in practice. Performing a clinical exam on a young child was associated to willingness to see children younger than two years of age in practice.

"Bacillus Calmette-Guerin and BCG cell wall skeleton suppressed viability of bladder cancer cells in vitro. AIM: Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is one of therapeutic options for urothelial carcinoma (UC). The objectives of this study were to determine the direct effect of viable or heat-killed BCG and BCG cell wall skeleton (BCG-CWS) on UC cells in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: UC cell lines were co-cultured with viable or heat-killed BCG Immunobladder(R) (Tokyo 172 strain) and BCG-CWS. Viability of the cells, apoptosis and BrdU incorporation were estimated. RESULTS: BCG induced cell growth retardation in highly malignant UC bearing integrin alpha5beta1 (VLA5). VLA5-blocking antibody partially abrogated this effect. BCG treatment induced a modest increase in the sub-G(1) fraction of cells and a decrease of BrdU incorporation. Cell growth retardation effect of viable BCG was reproduced by both heat-killed BCG and BCG-CWS. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that VLA5 may be a biomarker of UC with sensitivity to BCG. Moreover, BCG-CWS is a promising substance which might replace BCG, preventing life-threatening complications of viable BCG treatment.",cancer
"Patient-centered discussions about prostate cancer screening: a real-world approach. National guidelines recommend that primary care providers discuss the risks and benefits of prostate cancer screening with their patients but give little guidance on how to fit such a complex discussion into a busy clinic encounter. The authors propose a process-oriented approach (Ask-Tell-Ask) that promotes tailored conversations and value-based recommendations. The Ask-Tell-Ask approach includes diagnosing a patient's informational needs, providing targeted education based on those needs, and making a shared decision about testing. This time-efficient model emphasizes the provider's role as an interactive guide rather than a one-way supplier of information. Although there is no way to make these discussions simple, this streamlined strategy can help patients and providers efficiently negotiate the complex and important decision of screening for prostate cancer.",cancer
"Laparoscopic vs open hepatic resection for benign and malignant tumors: An updated meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: To compare laparoscopic hepatic resection (LHR) with open hepatic resection (OHR) for benign and malignant tumors. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and EMBASE databases were searched for relevant studies published between January 1, 1998, and May 1, 2009. STUDY SELECTION: Studies clearly documenting a comparison of LHR with OHR for benign and malignant neoplasms were selected. DATA EXTRACTION: Operative and postoperative measures, resection margins, complications, and survival outcomes were evaluated. Weighted mean differences, relative risks, and hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Twenty-six studies were included in the meta-analysis. The HR of death for malignant tumors was significantly lower in the LHR group compared with the OHR group (HR, 0.64; P = .04). The HR of recurrence for malignant tumors was not significantly different between the 2 groups (HR, 0.79; P = .37). The LHR group had a lower operative blood loss (weighted mean difference, -161 mL; P < .001) and relative risk of total postoperative complications (relative risk, 0.40; P < .001). Duration of hospital stay, days of intravenous narcotic use, and days until oral intake were all significantly lower in the LHR group compared with the OHR group. Operative time between LHR and OHR was not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic hepatic resection for malignant tumors is associated with a long-term survival that is at least comparable, if not superior, to OHR with no difference in disease recurrence. The use of LHR for benign and malignant tumors is a safe alternative to OHR with potential operative and postoperative benefits.",cancer
"Alpha-fetoprotein secretion in a craniopharyngioma. Are craniopharyngiomas part of the germ cell tumor family? A 14-months-old girl was admitted to our hospital because of excessive irritability and abnormal eye movements over the last two months. Brain CT and MRI revealed a suprasellar cystic and partially solid mass with calcifications. The laboratory investigation revealed increased serum levels of AFP. These findings were suggestive for a brain germ cell tumor. Therefore, systemic chemotherapy was started. After two courses there was a reduction in the levels of AFP but the tumor size remained unchanged. Subtotal tumor excision was performed that revealed the presence of a craniopharyngioma. One month later there was enlargement of the cystic part of the tumor, while serum AFP was elevated. The child received again systemic chemotherapy and placement of a reservoir into the cystic part of the tumor. Analysis of the intracystic flouid revealed the presence of beta-HCG and AFP. Following that the patient received brachytherapy with intracavity yttrium placement. Three months later repeated MRI showed a decrease in the size of the cystic part, while the solid part remained unchanged. Thus, the solid part was treated by radiosurgery. One year later the patient was stable but with complete loss of vision. These observations support the theory of a germ cell tumor family, in which craniopharyngioma and germ cell tumor present the two sides of the same entity, while between them a wide variety of tumors, with variable type of secretion of AFP and/or beta-HCG, may exist.",cancer

Challenging issues remain with regard to both the pathologic diagnosis and the clinical management of these tumors. OBJECTIVES: To provide an updated overview of the histogenesis, clinical and pathologic characteristics, diagnostic terminology, and relevant clinical management of the various types of anal canal tumors. DATA SOURCES: Recent literature on clinical and pathologic characteristics of anal canal tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Although most anal canal tumors are of squamous lineage, a complex variety of other tumors also occurs. Recognition of such diverse tumor entities will allow accurate pathologic diagnosis and most optimal clinical management.",cancer
"Metformin use and mortality among patients with diabetes and atherothrombosis. BACKGROUND: Metformin is recommended in type 2 diabetes mellitus because it reduced mortality among overweight participants in the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study when used mainly as a means of primary prevention. However, metformin is often not considered in patients with cardiovascular conditions because of concerns about its safety. METHODS: We assessed whether metformin use was associated with a difference in mortality among patients with atherothrombosis. The study sample comprised 19 691 patients having diabetes with established atherothrombosis participating in the Reduction of Atherothrombosis for Continued Health (REACH) Registry between December 1, 2003, and December 31, 2004, treated with or without metformin. Multivariable adjustment and propensity score were used to account for baseline differences. The main outcome measure was 2-year mortality. RESULTS: The mortality rates were 6.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.2%-7.4%) with metformin and 9.8% 8.4%-11.2%) without metformin; the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) was 0.76 (0.65-0.89; P < .001). Association with lower mortality was consistent among subgroups, noticeably in patients with a history of congestive heart failure (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.54-0.90; P = .006), patients older than 65 years (0.77; 0.62-0.95; P = .02), and patients with an estimated creatinine clearance of 30 to 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (0.64; 95% CI, 0.48-0.86; P = .003) (to convert creatinine clearance to mL/s/m(2), multiply by 0.0167). CONCLUSIONS: Metformin use may decrease mortality among patients with diabetes when used as a means of secondary prevention, including subsets of patients in whom metformin use is not now recommended. Metformin use should be tested prospectively in this population to confirm its effect on survival.",nocancer
"Is perioperative chemotherapy useful for solitary, metachronous, colorectal liver metastases? BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy is increasingly used in colorectal liver metastases (CRLMs) even when they are initially resectable. The aim of our study was to address the still pending question of whether perioperative chemotherapy is really beneficial in patients developing solitary metastases at a distance from surgery of the primary. METHODS: We analyzed a multicentric cohort of 1471 patients resected for solitary, metachronous, primarily resectable CRLMs without extrahepatic disease in the LiverMetSurvey International Registry over a 15-year period. Patients who received at least 3 cycles of oxaliplatin- or irinotecan-based chemotherapy before liver surgery (group CS, n = 169) were compared with those who were resected upfront (group S, n = 1302). RESULTS: Patients of group CS were more frequently females (49% vs 36%, P = 0.001) and had larger metastases (>/=5 cm, 33% vs 23%, P = 0.007); no difference was observed with regard to age, site of the primary tumour, time delay to occurrence of metastases, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels at the time of diagnosis in the 2 groups. The rate of postoperative complications was significantly higher in group CS (37.2% vs 24% in group S, P = 0.006). At univariate analysis, preoperative chemotherapy did not impact the overall survival (OS) (60% at 5 years in both groups); however, postoperative chemotherapy was associated with better OS (65% vs 55% at 5 years, P < 0.01). At multivariate analysis, age 70 years or older (P = 0.05), lymph node positivity in the primary tumor (P = 0.02), a primary-to-metastases time delay of less than 12 months (P = 0.04), raised CEA levels of more than 5 ng/mL at diagnosis (P < 0.01), a tumor diameter of 5 cm or more (P < 0.01), noncurative liver resection (P < 0.01), and the absence of postoperative chemotherapy (P < 0.01) were independent prognostic factors of survival. The disease-free survival (DFS) was negatively influenced by CEA level of more than 5 ng/mL (P < 0.01), size of the metastases 5 cm or more (P = 0.05), and the absence of postoperative chemotherapy (P < 0.01). When patients with metastases of less than 5 cm in size were compared to those with metastases of size 5 cm or more, preoperative chemotherapy did not influence the OS or DFS in either group. Postoperative chemotherapy, on the other hand, improved OS and DFS in patients with metastases of size 5 cm or more but not in patients with metastases of less than 5 cm in size. CONCLUSIONS: Although preoperative chemotherapy does not seem to benefit the outcome of patients with solitary, metachronous CRLM, postoperative chemotherapy is associated with better OS and DFS, mainly when the tumor diameter exceeds 5 cm.",cancer
"The development of 'Quality of Life Instrument for Indian Diabetes patients (QOLID): a validation and reliability study in middle and higher income groups. PURPOSE: To develop a reliable and valid quality of life questionnaire for Indian patients with diabetes. METHODS: A draft of 75 questions was prepared on the basis of expert opinion, focus group discussions, review of existing literature and detailed semi-structured interviews of patients with diabetes with the intention of including all aspects of diabetes-specific and quality of life considered relevant by patients and care providers to enable constrict validity. A Stage 2 questionnaire was then prepared with 13 domains and 54 items (questions) after expert panel review for obvious irrelevance and duplication of issues. It was administered to 150 participants visiting a diabetes center at New Delhi. Factor analysis was done using principal component method with varimax rotation. Reliability analysis was done by calculating Cronbach's Alpha. For evaluating concordant validity the questionnaire was co-administered with DQL-CTQ to 30 participants. The discriminant validity of the questionnaire was tested using 't' test for metabolic control, co-morbidities, insulin use and gender. RESULTS: Using principal component method 8 domains were identified on the basis of an apriori hypothesis and the scree plot. These 8 domains explained 49.9% of the total variation. 34 items (questions) were selected to represent these domains on the basis of extraction communality, factor loading, inter-item and item-total correlations. The final questionnaire has an Overall Cronbach's Alpha value of 0.894 (subscale- 0.55 to 0.85) showing high internal consistency. The questionnaire showed good concordance (product moment correlation 0.724; p = 0.001; subscale correlation - 0.457 to 0.779) with the DQL-CTQ. The overall standardized questionnaire score showed good responsiveness to metabolic control and co-morbidities establishing discriminant validity. CONCLUSION: The final version of questionnaire with 8 domains and 34 items is a reliable and valid tool for assessment of quality of life of Indian patients with diabetes.",nocancer
"Necessity of bilateral bone marrow biopsies for ancillary cytogenetic studies in the pediatric population. The need for bilateral pediatric bone marrow biopsies for cytogenetic and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) studies has not been clearly delineated. We retrospectively identified 166 pediatric bilateral bone marrow biopsy specimens obtained from patients with a variety of clinical diagnoses, including solid tumors, lymphoma, leukemia, and other hematologic conditions. The cases included all pediatric bilateral bone marrow biopsies performed at our hospital spanning the years of 1992 to 2008. Agreement of FISH and classical cytogenetic results between the 2 sides was assessed. Of a total of 166 bilateral cases, 2 cases showed disagreement (1.2%), both from patients with solid tumors. One case was a rhabdomyosarcoma, in which FISH only was performed; the second was a neuroblastoma in which FISH and cytogenetics were performed (both FISH and classical cytogenetic results disagreed). The remainder of the cases showed complete agreement between the 2 sides (total 98.8%). We conclude that it is usually not necessary to perform bilateral bone marrow biopsies for FISH and cytogenetics in the pediatric population outside of the setting of solid tumor staging.",cancer
"Gaucher-like cells in retroperitoneal extramedullary hematopoietic tumor diagnosed by fine needle aspiration: a case report. BACKGROUND: Extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH) can present as a diffuse lesion or as a solitary mass. EMH is most commonly seen in patients with hematologic disorders and rarely in asymptomatic patients. The liver, spleen and lymph nodes are the most common EMH sites. However, EMH has also been seen at unusual sites, including adrenal glands, breast, thymus, thyroid, kidney, epididymis, lung, pleura, peripheral nerves and dura mater. The diagnosis of this lesion on fine needle aspiration (FNA) smears has rarely been described. CASE: A 20-year-old man with Cooley's anemia presented with a retroperitoneal tumor for the past 3 months that was clinically diagnosed as malignant. Ultrasonographically guided FNA cytology showed bone marrow cells composed of myelocytes, lymphocytes, erythroblasts and megakaryocytes, which were consistent with an extramedullary hematopoietic tumor. Histologic sections of the excised tumor confirmed the FNA diagnosis. Interestingly, Gaucher-like cells were frequently seen in the smears. CONCLUSION: The FNA findings of EMH can be confused with those of inflammatory pseudotumor, Hodgkin lymphoma, myeloproliferative disorders and granulocytic sarcoma. Clinical history can be helpful for interpreting FNA findings in an EMH diagnosis.",cancer
"Inside the black box: measuring addiction treatment services and their relation to outcomes. The adoption of performance-based management has been under consideration by addiction treatment funding agencies, and, recently, many state and county agencies have developed performance-based measurement/management systems in an attempt to improve their treatment system. This article describes one such effort in Los Angeles County, California. The Performance-Based Pilot Project linked treatment encounters (counseling sessions, drug testing, case management, and methadone dosing) with client outcomes (abstinence or reduced drug use at discharge) and longer lengths of stay in treatment. Eleven outpatient counseling programs and three narcotic treatment programs participated in the nine-month project. Results indicated that for both outpatient counseling and narcotic treatment programs, more sessions attended in the first 30 days was associated with better client outcomes and longer lengths of stay. Furthermore, in outpatient counseling programs, more group sessions during the first 30 days predicted abstinence or greater reductions in primary drug use; in narcotic treatment programs, more doses received during the first 30 days was correlated to longer treatment retention. This research implies that increasing the availability of counseling sessions for a client's first 30 days and engaging clients early is a promising area for program efforts to improve treatment outcomes and program performance.",nocancer
"A prospective crossover pilot study to evaluate the use of a topical wound gel in patients with cutaneous toxicity caused by epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors. One of the dose-limiting toxicities of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (EGFRIs) is a papulopustular rash that is often pruritic and painful. Secondary skin infection can occur from scratching to relieve the pruritus. Studies suggest that this rash might be a surrogate marker for efficacy; therefore, effective rash management is needed to allow patients to use EGFRIs without unnecessary dose modifications. In this single-center, prospective, crossover study, we evaluated the use of a topical gel (Regenecare Wound Gel) for relieving the pruritus and pain of EGFRI-induced rash among oncology patients. The secondary end points were patient satisfaction, adverse effects, and EGFRI dose modifications. At the occurrence of grade 2 skin rash, patients started applying the study gel to the right side of their face; after 1 week, they began applying it to both sides of their face for up to an additional 5 weeks. Each week, providers performed a facial evaluation and patients rated their symptoms and satisfaction on questionnaires. Of the 20 patients enrolled, 13 were evaluable. Reduction in itch at the end of week 1 was greater on the right (treated) side in 69% of patients greater on the left (untreated) side in 8%, and the same in 23% (P = 0.01). The pattern was similar for pain, but the differences were not significant. On average, patients rated the gel as being moderately to extremely effective for alleviating symptoms, improving rash appearance, and promoting healing and found it easy to apply. No adverse effects were documented. Four patients (31%) required EGFRI dose modifications because of rash. Taken together, these findings suggest that the topical wound gel is effective in relieving rash-associated itching in patients receiving EGFRIs and is associated with high patient satisfaction.",cancer
"Modified surface coatings and their effect on drug adsorption within the extracorporeal life support circuit. A recently completed study quantified the percent of fentanyl or morphine sulfate lost to uncoated polyvinylchloride (PVC) tubing or to one of two hollow fiber oxygenators within the extracorporeal life support (ECLS) circuit. The results demonstrated the majority of drug loss was due to adsorption by the PVC tubing. The purpose of this study was to determine if a tubing coating process affects fentanyl or morphine Sulfate adsorption. The goal was to quantify fentanyl or morphine sulfate lost due to adhesion within surface modified tubing. The following surface modifications were studied: 1) Maquet Safeline (synthetic immobilized albumin); 2) Maquet Softline (a heparin free biopassive polymer); 3) Maquet Bioline (recombinant human albumin + heparin) (Maquet Cardiopulmonary AG, Hirrlingen, Germany); 4) Terumo X Coating (poly2methoxylacrylate)) (Terumo Cardiovascular Systems Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI); 5) Medtronic Carmeda (covalently bonded heparin); and 6) Medtronic Trillium (covalently bonded heparin) (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN). A total of 36 individual circuits were built from the above six available modified surface coatings, for a total of six individual circuits of each coating type. Blood samples were drawn at 5 minutes, 120 minutes, and 360 minutes followed by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography to determine available circulating levels of either fentanyl or morphine sulfate. Fentanyl concentrations decreased to an average final available concentration of 35% (+/- 5%) within the 18 circuits. Morphine sulfate however, decreased to a final available concentration of 57% (+ 1%) in all Maquet tubing and the Medtronic Trillium tubing, while it decreased to a final concentration of 35% (+ 1%) in the Medtronic Carmeda coated tubing and in the Terumo X Coating tubing. Biocompatible ECLS circuit surface coatings affected drug-adsorption and availability. Further evaluation is necessary to understand the adsorptive loss of other drugs administered to our patients while on modified surface coated ECLS circuits.",nocancer
"What really matters in pain management for terminally ill cancer patients in Taiwan. The paradox of patients who are in pain yet satisfied with their pain management has been documented repeatedly. Pain relief constitutes only one part of patient satisfaction with pain management. The quality of cancer pain management in Taiwan has not been evaluated from the patient's perspective. A cross-sectional design was used to survey 1,370 terminally ill cancer patients in Taiwan to characterize the status of, and satisfaction with cancer pain management by investigating the relative importance of pain intensity, pain relief experiences, and clinicians' pain management practices. Cancer patients with pain had unsatisfactory pain relief within one week of admission (47.4 percent) and inadequate pain medication (23.6 percent). However, these patients perceived that clinicians adequately informed them about pain treatment. Patient satisfaction with pain management was primarily determined by examining the perceptions that medication dose was just right, responses to requests for pain medication were prompt, and understandable and consistent information about pain treatment was offered. In conclusion, Taiwanese cancer patients' satisfaction with pain management was influenced more by perceived pain management practices than by pain relief itself.",cancer
"Mapping dental establishments in Massachusetts just before the recession. Bureau data indicate a continuing national increase in the number and size of dental establishments in the time just prior to the recent recession. During this same period in Massachusetts, there were marked increases in the number of individuals employed in dental facilities, and there was a combination of a minor increase of the population and limited proportional increase in the numbers of dentists and dental establishments. This resulted in small changes in population-to-dental facility ratios in most counties in the state. The usual favorable expectations of an economic upswing after a recession for dental establishments may need to be tempered given the increased overhead costs resulting from increased numbers of employees and the fact that the state has the highest dentist-to-population ratio in the country.",nocancer

Liver transplantation is an accepted management for end stage liver disease, early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma, and acute liver failure. The number of patients with end stage liver disease is growing rapidly. Living Donor Liver Transplantation (LDLT) has become an important alternative to cadaveric organ transplant for patients with end stage liver disease. On average, about one in three potential donors eventually donate part of their liver The overall reported donor mortality was 0.2% and median morbidity of l6%. Understanding donor outcomes is important as it enables the transplant team to fully inform the potential donor In addition, this information will help the transplant team improve their post operative management and plan for long-term follow-up after liver donation.",nocancer
"Monte Carlo calculated TG-60 dosimetry parameters for the beta- emitter 153Sm brachytherapy source. PURPOSE: The formalism recommended by Task Group 60 (TG-60) of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) is applicable for beta sources. Radioactive biocompatible and biodegradable 153Sm glass seed without encapsulation is a beta- emitter radionuclide with a short half-life and delivers a high dose rate to the tumor in the millimeter range. This study presents the results of Monte Carlo calculations of the dosimetric parameters for the 153Sm brachytherapy source. METHODS: Version 5 of the (MCNP) Monte Carlo radiation transport code was used to calculate two-dimensional dose distributions around the source. The dosimetric parameters of AAPM TG-60 recommendations including the reference dose rate, the radial dose function, the anisotropy function, and the one-dimensional anisotropy function were obtained. RESULTS: The dose rate value at the reference point was estimated to be 9.21 +/- 0.6 cGy h(-1) microCi(-1). Due to the low energy beta emitted from 153Sm sources, the dose fall-off profile is sharper than the other beta emitter sources. The calculated dosimetric parameters in this study are compared to several beta and photon emitting seeds. CONCLUSIONS: The results show the advantage of the 153Sm source in comparison with the other sources because of the rapid dose fall-off of beta ray and high dose rate at the short distances of the seed. The results would be helpful in the development of the radioactive implants using 153Sm seeds for the brachytherapy treatment.",cancer
"Is pharmacogenetic CYP2D6 testing useful? BACKGROUND: Pharmacogenetic testing is used to uncover genetic causes for variations in drug response. Documentation of the method's usefulness in a clinical setting is scarce. The aim of the study was to systematically categorize the experience from routine CYP2D6 genotyping in a diagnostic laboratory. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All samples submitted to our laboratory for CYP2D6 genotyping in the period 29.06.98-28.12.09 were examined retrospectively. The samples were classified into three indication groups based on clinical information given in the request form. All samples, and a control group consisting of 100 healthy blood donors, were tested for the four most prevalent non-functional CYP2D6 alleles in the European population, and for ultrarapid metabolizer-associated duplications of the gene. RESULTS: 325 samples were included. The proportion of ultrarapid metabolizers was significantly higher in the patient group (4.0 %, p = 0.045) than in the control group (0 %), with the highest proportion among those patients that used a known CYP2D6 substrate. The percentage of poor metabolizers was not significantly higher in the patient group (8.3 %) than in the control group (6.0 %) (p = 0.528). INTERPRETATION: The CYP2D6 analysis could rarely explain the patients' side effects or lack of drug response, even though the study group was selected because of clinical problems due to drugs they were using. Two explanations may be that the indication(s) for genetic testing is not clearly defined and that the CYP2D6 genotype is only one of many factors that determine individual drug response.",nocancer
"Sarcomatoid neoplasms of the lung and pleura. Sarcomatoid neoplasms of the lung and pleura are rare tumors that present a complex differential diagnosis, making them challenging for surgical pathologists. In the lung, the main tumors are the sarcomatoid carcinomas, including pleomorphic carcinoma, spindle cell carcinoma, giant cell carcinoma, carcinosarcoma, and pulmonary blastoma. They are characterized by histologic heterogeneity; molecular data support their origin from a pluripotent stem cell that undergoes neoplastic transformation with divergent epithelial and sarcomatous differentiation. Diagnosis is difficult in small biopsy specimens and typically requires a resection specimen. Despite the presence of sarcomatoid features, these tumors are classified as lung carcinomas. Pulmonary blastomas must be distinguished from pleuropulmonary blastomas, which are a unique type of thoracic sarcoma typically occurring in young children. In the pleura, the main tumors to consider are the sarcomatoid and desmoplastic types of malignant mesothelioma, solitary fibrous tumor, and desmoid tumor. While light microscopy is sufficient to diagnose most of these tumors, immunohistochemistry can be useful in selected settings. In particular, it can aid to confirm epithelial differentiation in spindle cell carcinomas and the presence of rhabdomyosarcoma in sarcomatoid carcinomas, mesotheliomas, or pleuropulmonary blastomas. For sarcomatoid and desmoplastic mesothelioma, keratin is the most useful stain because it can highlight invasive growth and mesothelial markers are positive in only the minority of cases. Clinical and radiologic correlation is needed to separate some pleomorphic carcinomas with pleural involvement from sarcomatoid malignant mesothelioma, since these poorly differentiated tumors may not express the usual immunohistochemical markers for carcinoma or mesothelioma.",cancer
"Multilocus sequence types in Czech neonatal GBS strains from 2004 to 2008. The first multilocus sequence typing results of Czech neonatal Streptococcus agalactiae isolates are presented in this paper.

"A novel GSK-3 beta-C/EBP alpha-miR-122-insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor regulatory circuitry in human hepatocellular carcinoma. miR-122 is a highly abundant, hepatocyte-specific microRNA. The biomedical significance and regulatory mechanisms of miR-122 remain obscure. We explored the role of miR-122 in tumorigenesis in the context of gene regulatory network. The miR-122 promoter and its transactivator were identified by way of luciferase reporter system, electrophoretic mobility shift, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. The miR-122 regulatory circuitry and its implication in hepatocarcinogenesis were identified using livers of different development stages, human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and cell lines, and aflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1))-transformed cells. We characterized the -5.3 to -4.8 kb region upstream of miR-122 precursor as miR-122 promoter. Further investigation revealed that deletion of predicted CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) binding sites C/EBPalpha knockdown significantly reduced miR-122 promoter activity and endogenous miR-122 expression; and C/EBPalpha directly interacted with the miR-122 promoter in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that C/EBPalpha is a transactivator for miR-122 transcription. We further demonstrated that miR-122 suppressed insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) translation and sustained glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3beta) activity. The activated GSK-3beta not only repressed cell proliferation, but also activated C/EBPalpha, which maintained miR-122 levels and thereby enforced IGF-1R suppression. Interestingly, down-regulation of miR-122 and C/EBPalpha, and up-regulation of IGF-1R were frequently observed in HCC tissues, and decreased miR-122 levels were associated with worse survival of HCC patients. Moreover, AFB(1) exposure resulted in decreased activity in GSK-3beta, C/EBPalpha, and miR-122 and increased levels of IGF-1R, whereas restoration of miR-122 suppressed the tumorigenicity of HCC and AFB(1)-transformed cells. CONCLUSION: We have identified a novel GSK-3beta-C/EBPalpha-miR-122-IGF-1R regulatory circuitry whose dysfunction may contribute to the development of HCC. Our findings provide new insight into miR-122's function and the mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis.",cancer
"Nutrient intakes of US infants, toddlers, and preschoolers meet or exceed dietary reference intakes. OBJECTIVES: To assess the usual nutrient intakes of 3,273 US infants, toddlers, and preschoolers, aged 0 to 47 months, surveyed in the Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study (FITS) 2008; and to compare data on the usual nutrient intakes for the two waves of FITS conducted in 2002 and 2008. DESIGN: The FITS 2008 is a cross-sectional survey of a national random sample of US children from birth through age 47 months. Usual nutrient intakes derived from foods, beverages, and supplements were ascertained using a telephone-administered, multiple-pass 24-hour dietary recall. SUBJECTS: Infants aged birth to 5 months (n=382) and 6 to 11 months (n=505), toddlers aged 12 to 23 months (n=925), and preschoolers aged 24 to 47 months (n=1,461) were surveyed. METHODS: All primary caregivers completed one 24-hour dietary recall and a random subsample (n=701) completed a second 24-hour dietary recall. The personal computer version of the Software for Intake Distribution Estimation was used to estimate the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles, as well as the proportions below and above cutoff values defined by the Dietary Reference Intakes or the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. RESULTS: Usual nutrient intakes met or exceeded energy and protein requirements with minimal risk of vitamin and mineral deficiencies. The usual intakes of antioxidants, B vitamins, bone-related nutrients, and other micronutrients were adequate relative to the Adequate Intakes or Estimated Average Requirements, except for iron and zinc in a small subset of older infants, and vitamin E and potassium in toddlers and preschoolers. Intakes of synthetic folate, preformed vitamin A, zinc, and sodium exceeded Tolerable Upper Intake Level in a significant proportion of toddlers and preschoolers. Macronutrient distributions were within acceptable macronutrient distribution ranges, except for dietary fat, in some toddlers and preschoolers. Dietary fiber was low in the vast majority of toddlers and preschoolers, and saturated fat intakes exceeded recommendations for the majority of preschoolers. The prevalence of inadequate intakes, excessive intake, and intakes outside the acceptable macronutrient distribution range was similar in FITS 2002 and FITS 2008. CONCLUSIONS: In FITS 2008, usual nutrient intakes were adequate for the majority of US infants, toddlers, and preschoolers, except for a small but important number of infants at risk for inadequate iron and zinc intakes. Diet quality should be improved in the transition from infancy to early childhood, particularly with respect to healthier fats and fiber in the diets of toddlers and preschoolers.",nocancer
"MDM2 promotes cell motility and invasiveness through a RING-finger independent mechanism. Recent studies connect MDM2 with increased cell motility, invasion and/or metastasis proposing an MDM2-mediated ubiquitylation-dependent mechanism. Interestingly, in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) p53/MDM2 co-expression is associated with reduced survival which is independently linked with metastasis. We therefore investigated whether expression of p53 and/or MDM2 promotes aggressive cell phenotypes. Our data demonstrate that MDM2 promotes increased motility and invasiveness in RCC cells (N.B. similar results are obtained in non-RCC cells). This study shows for the first time both that endogenous MDM2 significantly contributes to cell motility and that this does not depend upon the MDM2 RING-finger, i.e. is independent of ubiquitylation (and NEDDylation). Our data suggest that protein-protein interactions provide a likely mechanistic basis for MDM2-promoted motility which may constitute future therapeutic targets.",cancer
"Achieving remission and recovery in bipolar disorder. Pharmacotherapy is the primary treatment for bipolar disorder, and several medications have proven efficacy for treating patients with the disorder. However, an efficacy/effectiveness gap exists in preventing recurrence of mood episodes and in returning patients to full functional recovery.

Evidence suggests that psychoeducation can be a helpful tool in improving treatment adherence and in addressing other factors that complicate the treatment of bipolar disorder, such as comorbidity, substance use, and cognitive impairment.",nocancer
"Federally qualified health center dental program finances: a case study. OBJECTIVES: We analyzed the operation of one Connecticut federally qualified health center (FOHC) dental program with seven delivery sites. We assessed the financial operation of the different delivery sites and contrasted the overall performance of the FOHC with private practices. METHODS: We obtained data from a pretested financial survey instrument, electronic patient visit records, and site visits. To assess clinic productivity, we used two output measures: patient visits and market value of services. For the latter, we estimated the implicit fee of each service provided in patient visits. RESULTS: On average, these clinics were running a modest deficit, mainly due to startup costs of two new clinics. The primary factor that impacted net revenues was low reimbursement rates, including privately insured patients. When FOHC dental revenues were adjusted to market rates, revenues were close to expenses. CONCLUSIONS: FOHC dental clinics are major components of the dental safety net system. This case study suggests that the established clinics use resources as effectively as private practices.",nocancer

"Factors influencing subjective orthodontic treatment need and culture-related differences among Chinese natives and foreign inhabitants. AIM: The aim of this survey was to compare Chinese natives and foreign inhabitants in Chengdu, China, with respect to: (1) attitudes towards dental appearance, (2) subjective orthodontic treatment need, and (3) the main factors influencing orthodontic treatment need. METHODOLOGY: A total of 522 subjects, including 227 foreign inhabitants and 295 Chinese natives in Chengdu participated in the survey. A simple random sampling method was adopted and a face-to-face interview was conducted at some public sites using a questionnaire. Data was entered by two persons synchronously using Epidata 3.0, and SPSS 13.0 was used to analyze these data. RESULTS: 89.0% of foreign inhabitants were satisfied with their teeth compared to only 46.8% of Chinese natives. Females were more dissatisfied with their teeth than males. Chinese natives put improving appearance as the top priority (55.9%) for seeking orthodontic treatment; however, in foreign inhabitants, the main reason for seeking treatment was to improve masticatory function (44.1%), followed by ""to be pretty"" (35.2%). The importance of well-aligned teeth and self-perception of psychosocial impact of malocclusion were the same two main factors influencing subjective orthodontic treatment need (P < 0.05) in foreign inhabitants and Chinese natives. Subjective orthodontic treatment need between the two target groups was significantly different (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: (1) It was very common that Chinese natives were dissatisfied with their dental appearance, and their subjective orthodontic treatment needs were high. (2) There were some differences in orthodontic treatment motives between the two target groups. (3) There were differences in subjective orthodontic treatment needs between foreign inhabitants and Chinese natives. However, the prominent influential factors were almost the same.

However, the detailed mechanisms underlying this process are generally unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of NCTD-induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells. METHODS: The cytotoxicity was measured by MTT assay for cellular viability and by flow cytometry. The mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species production was evaluated by flow cytometry analysis. The role of caspase activities were assayed using caspase apoptosis detection kit . Western blot analysis was used to evaluate the level of Cyto-C, Bcl-2, Bax, Bid, caspase 3, -9, -8 and PARP expression RESULTS: After treatment with NCTD, a decrease in the viability of HepG2 cells and increase in apoptosis were observed. NCTD-induced apoptosis was accompanied by an increase in ROS production, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c(cyto-c) from the mitochondria to the cytosol and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 levels with concurrent up-regulation in pro-apoptotic protein Bax levels. However, another pro-apoptotic molecule, Bid, showed no change in such same treatment. NCTD-increased activity of caspase 9,caspase 3 and the subsequent cleavage caspase substrate PARP were also observed. The expression levels of pro-caspase-8 were not changed after NCTD treatment. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that NCTD induced cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells by apoptosis, which is mediated through ROS generation and mitochondrial pathway.",cancer
"Nano titanium dioxide induces the generation of ROS and potential damage in HaCaT cells under UVA irradiation. Nano titanium dioxide (nano-TiO2) is frequently used in cosmetics, especially in sunscreen. Nano-TiO2 has been reported to be an efficient photocatalyst, which is able to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) under UVA irradiation. However, the effects and mechanisms of skin toxicity caused by nano-TiO2 remain unclear. In this study, we explored the cytotoxicity and oxidative stress induced by nano-TiO2 under UVA irradiation with different crystal forms (anatase, rutile and anatase/rutile) and sizes (4 nm, 10 nm, 21 nm, 25 nm, 60 nm) in human keratinocyte HaCaT cells. Intracellular distribution of nano-TiO2, cell viability, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), super oxide dismutase (SOD) activity and Malondialdehyde (MDA) content were measured. The results showed that nano-TiO2 (10-200 microg/ml) significantly reduced cell viability in a dose-dependent manner in HaCaT cells. The cell viability was 76.9%, 60.2%, and 44.1% following nano-TiO2 (4 nm), nano-TiO2 (10 nm) and P25 treatment at the concentration of 200 microg/ml, respectively (P < 0.01). Nano-TiO2 induced ROS resulted in oxidative stress in these cells by reducing SOD and increasing MDA levels. The MMP of the cells was decreased significantly (P < 0.01) while the apoptosis rate was increased. Anatase and amorphous forms of nano-TiO2 showed higher cytotoxicity than the rutile form. The results indicated that nano-TiO2 could induce the generation of ROS and damage HaCaT cells under UVA irradiation.",nocancer
"Microgeographic variations in Burkitt's lymphoma incidence correlate with differences in malnutrition, malaria and Epstein-Barr virus. BACKGROUND: Endemic Burkitt's lymphoma (eBL) has been associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and holoendemic Plasmodium falciparum malaria. But recent evidence suggests that other risk factors are involved. METHODS: We hypothesised that selenoprotein glutathione peroxidase (GPx), a surrogate of nutritional status, is an important biomarker for eBL risk. We measured plasma GPx, anthropometric markers of malnutrition, EBV viral loads and malaria parasitaemia in children aged 1-9 years (n=258) from two locations in Nyanza Province, Kenya, with higher-than-expected and lower-than-expected incidence of eBL. The study participants were malaria asymptomatic children from the community. RESULTS: Children from eBL high-incidence areas had significantly lower GPx levels, high EBV viral load and more evidence of chronic malnutrition than children from eBL low-incidence areas (all P<0.001). Additionally, GPx levels were significantly lower in children with the highest EBV viral load and for those with P. falciparum infections (P=0.035 and P=0.004, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that selenium deficiency may be a risk factor for eBL.",cancer
"One-stage repair of extensive thoracic aortic disease. OBJECTIVE: Staged procedures for extensive aneurysmal disease of the thoracic aorta are associated with substantial cumulative mortality for the 2 procedures and death in the interval in between, often from aortic rupture. We have used a 1-stage procedure for operative repair of most, or all, of the thoracic aorta. METHODS: Ninety-five patients were treated using a bilateral anterior thoracotomy with transverse sternotomy, hypothermic circulatory arrest, and reperfusion of the arch vessels first to minimize brain ischemia. Fifty-six patients had chronic type A aortic dissections (all but 2 patients had a previous operation), 36 patients had degenerative aneurysms, and 3 patients had chronic type B aortic dissections with proximal extension. The ascending aorta and aortic arch were replaced in all patients combined with resection of varying lengths of descending aorta. RESULTS: In-hospital mortality was 8.4% (8 patients). Morbidity included reoperation for bleeding (11%), mechanical ventilation for more than 72 hours (48%), tracheostomy (17%), and renal dialysis (8%). Stroke occurred in 1 patient (1%). Seven of the 93 operative survivors (7.6%) have undergone successful reoperation on the graft (4 patients) or the contiguous aorta (3 patients). CONCLUSIONS: The 1-stage, arch-first technique is a safe and suitable alternative to 2-stage procedures for repair of thoracic aortic disease. Its effectiveness relative to more recently developed hybrid procedures awaits further analysis of long-term performance.",nocancer
"Use of paclitaxel for advanced ovarian cancer in clinical practice: analysis of 541 patients. Results from a German multi-centre observational study. Paclitaxel is one of the most common antitumour agents paclitaxel for the treatment of primary and relapsed ovarian cancer. Based on a German multicentre observational study, this article reflects the use of paclitaxel in German daily clinical practice. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data for a total of 541 patients in Germany were analysed, including 315 patients with primary ovarian cancer and 226 patients treated with paclitaxel with relapsed ovarian cancer. RESULTS: The mean age was 61.2 years, ranging from 22 to 85 years. No unexpected toxicities were ascertained. In general, grade III/IV haematological toxicities were rare. Only 15% of the patients suffered from grade III/IV leucopenia and 5% from thrombocytopenia. Alopecia and polyneuropathy were the most frequent non-haematological side-effects noticed. Response evaluation was provided in 183 patients with primary ovarian cancer (CR 39.8%, of these achieved a complete response (CR), and 27.9% a partial response (PR), resulting in an overall response rate (ORR) of 67.7%. In 13.7%, stable disease (SD) and in 19.7%, tumour progression (PD) were documented. In 196 patients with recurrent ovarian cancer, response evaluation was provided. A total of 28.6% of the patients achieved a CR, and 31.6% a PR, which produced an ORR of 60.2%. In 33.2%, SD and in 6.6%, PD were documented. CONCLUSION: Paclitaxel is broadly used in the management of patients with primary and relapsed ovarian cancer. The toxicity profile observed seems to be within the range of the results of clinical phase-III studies. The doses applied and the schedules based on the official recommendation of the working groups seem to have been influenced by international studies.",cancer
"Management of type 2 diabetes in geriatric patients. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) indicates age above 45 years as a major risk factor for diabetes and predicts that the number of persons with the disease, which currently stands at 190 million, will double by the year 2025. Several recent trials suggest that tighter glucose control reduces long-term complications in diabetic patients; however, outcomes of tight blood sugar control in the elderly are not known. Nevertheless, the principles of management of type 2 diabetes in the elderly are not different from those in middle-aged patients. There are several reasons to keep glucose control on target, also in the elderly; nonetheless, it should be considered that the risk of hypoglycemia is more deleterious in the elderly and should be avoided. The old and more recent oral glucose-lowering agents, along with the newer types of insulin, will be discussed in this review.",nocancer
"Coccydynia: a review of pathoanatomy, aetiology, treatment and outcome. Coccydynia is a painful disorder characterised by coccygeal pain which is typically exaggerated by pressure. It remains an unsolved mystery because of the perceived unpredictability of the origin of the pain, some psychological traits that may be associated with the disorder, the presence of diverse treatment options, and varied outcomes. A more detailed classification based on the aetiology and pathoanatomy of coccydynia helps to identify patients who may benefit from conservative and surgical management. This review focuses on the pathoanatomy, aetiology, clinical features, radiology, treatment and outcome of coccydynia.",nocancer
"An official American Thoracic Society systematic review: insurance status and disparities in lung cancer practices and outcomes. RATIONALE: Insurance coverage is an important determinant of access to care and is one potential cause of disparities in lung cancer care outcomes. OBJECTIVES: We performed a systematic review of the available literature to examine the association between insurance status and lung cancer practices and outcomes. METHODS: We searched multiple electronic databases through November 6, 2008 for studies that examined the association between lung cancer outcomes and insurance status. Two reviewers independently selected studies. One investigator evaluated their quality according to predetermined criteria, and abstracted data about study design, patients' demographic and clinical characteristics, and outcome measures. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 3,798 potentially relevant studies, 23 met eligibility criteria and were included. Studies reported heterogeneous outcomes among heterogeneous samples of patients that precluded a quantitative synthesis. In general, compared with patients with private or Medicare insurance, patients with Medicaid or no insurance had poorer lung cancer outcomes, including higher incidence rates, later stage at diagnosis, and poorer survival. Overall, patients with Medicaid or no insurance were less likely to undergo curative procedures, but patients without insurance were more likely to receive guideline-concordant care. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Medicaid or no insurance consistently had worse outcomes than other patients with lung cancer. Some of the disparities may be secondary to residual confounding from smoking and other health behaviors, but available data suggest that patients with lung cancer without insurance do poorly because access to care is limited and/or they present with more advanced disease that is less amenable to treatment.",cancer
"Comparison of in-office dental unit waterline test kits. The authors conducted a study to determine the validity of two commercially available in-office dental unit waterline test kits compared to the gold standard, R2A agar. Samples were collected from the air/water syringes of dental units and cultured on HPC Samplers, Petrifilm AC Plates, and R2A agar plates. HPC Samplers and R2A agar plates were incubated for 7 days and counted manually using magnification. Petrifilm AC Plates were counted after incubation time of 5 and 7 days using an electronic-plate reader. Validity measurements were calculated using a cutoff value < or = 500 colony-forming units per milliliter. The accuracy for the HPC Sampler compared to R2A agar was 71%. The accuracy for the Petrifilm AC Plates at 5 and 7 days was 79% and 87% compared to R2A agar. The Petrifilm AC Plate (7-day incubation) demonstrated higher sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and accuracy than the HPC Sampler kit.",nocancer
Postpartum hemorrhage from ruptured Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor: a case report. BACKGROUND: Spontaneous postpartum rupture of a Sertoli-Leydig cell ovarian tumor is an infrequent complication of a rare tumor. CASE: A 21-year-old nullipara with an uneventful prenatal course and spontaneous vaginal delivery experienced severe intraabdominal bleeding with hypovolemic shock postpartum from the rupture of a previously undiagnosed Sertoli-Leydig cell ovarian tumor. Diagnosis and intervention were delayed because of the late development of overt signs of intraabdominal bleeding and misleading findings on abdominal examination. Vigorous uterine compression may have precipitated the bleeding. Emergency exploration and surgical intervention were successfully undertaken. Full staging of the cancer was not possible at the initial surgery because of the patient's cardiovascular instability. CONCLUSION: Rupture of a Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor is a potential cause of postpartum hypovolemic shock resulting from massive intraabdominal bleeding.,cancer
"RNA sequencing shows no dosage compensation of the active X-chromosome. Mammalian cells from both sexes typically contain one active X chromosome but two sets of autosomes. It has previously been hypothesized that X-linked genes are expressed at twice the level of autosomal genes per active allele to balance the gene dose between the X chromosome and autosomes (termed 'Ohno's hypothesis'). This hypothesis was supported by the observation that microarray-based gene expression levels were indistinguishable between one X chromosome and two autosomes (the X to two autosomes ratio (X:AA) ~1). Here we show that RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is more sensitive than microarray and that RNA-Seq data reveal an X:AA ratio of ~0.5 in human and mouse. In Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodites, the X:AA ratio reduces progressively from ~1 in larvae to ~0.5 in adults. Proteomic data are consistent with the RNA-Seq results and further suggest the lack of X upregulation at the protein level. Together, our findings reject Ohno's hypothesis, necessitating a major revision of the current model of dosage compensation in the evolution of sex chromosomes.",nocancer
"Mortality among patients with tuberculosis and associations with HIV status --- United States, 1993-2008. Worldwide, tuberculosis (TB) incidence increased from 125 cases per 100,000 population in 1990 to 142 cases per 100,000 population in 2004, primarily because of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic. Persons with HIV are at increased risk for TB disease, and those with TB have a high risk for death. This is documented most clearly in resource-limited settings, where limited access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and other health-care services contribute to the elevated mortality. The impact of HIV on patients with TB is less clear in resource-rich nations such as the United States. To understand the impact of HIV on the risk for death during TB treatment in the United States, data were analyzed for all culture-positive patients with TB from 1993 to 2008, and the proportion that died was determined and stratified by HIV test result. Mortality data were restricted to patients reported before 2007. The proportion of all patients with TB who died during TB treatment decreased from 2,445 of 13,629 (18%) in 1993 to 682 of 7,578 (9%) in 2006. Among patients with TB and HIV, 950 of 2,337 (41%) died during treatment in 1993; this proportion declined to 131 of 663 (20%) in 2006. The proportion of patients with TB and HIV who received their TB diagnosis postmortem dropped from 191 of 2,927 (7%) in 1993 to 32 of 768 (4%) in 2006; 624 of 10,468 (6%) persons with TB and unknown HIV status received their TB diagnosis postmortem in 1993, and this proportion did not decline. Further reductions in mortality can be achieved by enhanced TB/HIV program collaboration and service integration.",nocancer
"Identification of carbonic anhydrase 9 as a contributor to pingyangmycin-induced drug resistance in human tongue cancer cells. Drug resistance is the major obstacle to successful cancer treatment. To understand the mechanisms responsible for drug resistance in tongue cancer, Tca8113 cells derived from moderately differentiated human tongue squamous cell carcinoma were exposed to stepwise escalated concentrations of pingyangmycin (PYM) to develop the resistant cell line called Tca8113/PYM, which showed over 18.78-fold increased resistance to PYM as compared with Tca8113 cells, and cross-resistance to cisplatin, pirarubicin, paclitaxel, adriamycin, and mitomycin. We found that the resistance was not associated with multidrug resistance transporter 1 (p170, p-gp), multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 and breast cancer resistance protein overexpression, so we hypothesized that Tca8113/PYM cells must have some other resistance mechanism selected by PYM. To test this hypothesis, the global gene expression profiles between Tca8113 and Tca8113/PYM cells were compared by cDNA microarray. Eighty-nine genes and thirteen expressed sequence tags with differential expression levels between the two cell lines were identified. Some differential expression levels were validated with real-time PCR and western blot. Furthermore, the functional validation showed that both carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitor acetazolamide application and CA9 silencing with CA9 antisense oligonucleotides contribute to the medium pH increase of Tca8113/PYM cells and enhanced PYM chemosensitivity. Moreover, both acetazolamide and CA9 antisense oligonucleotides significantly increased PYM-induced caspase 3 activation in Tca8113/PYM cells. Thus, our study suggests that the resistance of Tca8113/PYM cells is probably associated with CA9 and other differential expression molecules, and that CA9 may be an important marker for prediction of PYM responsiveness in tongue cancer chemotherapy.",cancer
"The essence of senescence. Almost half a century after the first reports describing the limited replicative potential of primary cells in culture, there is now overwhelming evidence for the existence of ""cellular senescence"" in vivo. It is being recognized as a critical feature of mammalian cells to suppress tumorigenesis, acting alongside cell death programs. Here, we review the various features of cellular senescence and discuss their contribution to tumor suppression. Additionally, we highlight the power and limitations of the biomarkers currently used to identify senescent cells in vitro and in vivo.",cancer
"Paranormal beliefs and religiosity: Chinese version of the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale. This paper reports an initial study investigating the relations of paranormal beliefs with religiosity in a Chinese sample, as well as the development of a Chinese version of the Revised Paranormal Belief Scale and a test of its psychometric properties with 310 college students (5.5% Christians, 21.3% Buddhists, 61% believers in traditional Chinese religions, and 12% atheists). The reliability and validity of the Chinese version were satisfactory. In general, traditional Chinese religious believers had higher scores on paranormal belief than did Christians and atheists, and the mean total score of the Chinese participants was higher than previously reported in a Western sample. It was concluded that the greater involvement of practitioners of traditional Chinese religions in activities emphasizing paranormal experiences might contribute to their greater paranormal belief, especially as compared to the minority Christian group. The results are consistent with the idea that Christianity may offer the least support for paranormal belief.",nocancer
"C-index is associated with functional outcomes after laparoscopic partial nephrectomy. PURPOSE: The C-index is a morphometric descriptor of renal masses that incorporates tumor size and site. We examined associations of the C-index with kidney function after laparoscopic partial nephrectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 131 patients who underwent laparoscopic partial nephrectomy for a single kidney tumor. We calculated the C-index from preoperative contrast enhanced computerized tomography images. Estimated glomerular filtration rate was calculated using the modification of diet in renal disease 2 equation. Nadir estimated glomerular filtration rate was calculated using peak serum creatinine within 7 days of surgery. RESULTS: The median C-index was 2.7 (range 0.7 to 9.6). The median preoperative and nadir estimated glomerular filtration rate was 78 (range 23 to 148) and 54 ml/minute/1.73 m2 (range 15 to 127, p<0.001). The mean+/-SD total glomerular filtration rate decrease was 28%+/-16%. On univariate analysis we noted a positive correlation between log C-index and the nadir estimated glomerular filtration rate (r=0.29, p=0.002), and a negative correlation between log C-index and the percent decrease in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (r=-0.4, p<0.001). On multivariate analysis the estimated glomerular filtration rate percent decrease was significantly associated with log C-index (p=0.005) and warm ischemia time (p<0.001) but not with tumor diameter or the preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate. Of patients with a C-index of 2.5 or less 70% showed a 30% or greater decrease in the estimated glomerular filtration rate vs 32% of those with a C-index of greater than 2.5 (RR 2.2, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The C-index is associated with the postoperative nadir estimated glomerular filtration rate and the percent decrease in the estimated glomerular filtration rate after laparoscopic partial nephrectomy. A C-index of less than 2.5 correlated with a 2.2-fold increased risk of a 30% or greater estimated glomerular filtration rate decrease after laparoscopic partial nephrectomy.",cancer
"Health risk behaviors of black male college students: seat belt use, smoking, and obesity status. This paper examined health behaviors (seatbelt use, tobacco use, and obesity status) of 127 black male college students using data obtained from the National College Health Risk Behavior Survey. The majority of the participants were freshmen and sophomores (70%), full time students (95%), and lived on campus (85%). The results indicated that black males often failed to use seatbelts while riding as a passenger (69%) or driving (48%). Although 15% of the students smoked, 1/3 of the smokers began smoking during college. Approximately 50% of the students were overweight or obese; among students attempting to lose weight, exercise versus nutrient intake was used as a means to lose weight. The study recommendations included the need to increase educational efforts to alert black males to their risks for a premature death, and to provide programming/mentoring initiatives to assist males in dealing with stress and discrimination that may impact their health-related decision making. The implications of this study suggest that even educated black males are at risk for premature disease and disability as a result of their health behaviors.",nocancer
"The relationship between mode of delivery and developmental dysplasia of the hip in breech infants: a four-year prospective cohort study. This prospective cohort study aimed to investigate the relationship between developmental dysplasia of the hip and mode of delivery in 571 consecutive breech infants using a modified Graf's static morphological method to grade the severity of dysplasia. In this group, 262 infants were born by planned Caesarian section, 223 by emergency section and 86 vaginally. Taking all grades of hip dysplasia into account (Graf types II, III and IV), there was no statistical difference in the incidence of dysplasia between the groups (elective section 8.4%, emergency section 8.1% and vaginal delivery 7.0%). However, when cases with Graf type II dysplasia, which may represent physiological immaturity, were excluded, the rate of type III and IV hips, which we consider to be clinically relevant, increased in the vaginally delivered group (4.7%) compared with the elective section group (1.1%), with a relative risk of approximately 1:4 (95% confidence interval 1.03 to 15.91). No difference was observed between the emergency and elective section groups, or between the emergency section and vaginally delivered groups. This study supports previous published work, with the added value that the diagnoses were all confirmed by ultrasound.",nocancer
"Hematopathologic and cytogenetic findings in imatinib mesylate treated chronic myelogenous leukemia patients: 2.5 years' experience. BACKGROUND/AIM: Imatinib mesylate, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with specific activity against the breakpoint cluster region--Abelson murine leukemia (BCR-ABL) tyrosine kinase has been developed for treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Its hematologic and cytogenetic effects have been evaluated in a series of clinical trials. The aim of this study was to report hematologic and cytogenetic response in CML patients during the treatment with imatinib mesylate. METHODS: A total of 21 patients were treated and observed from July 2006 to December 2008. The median time from CML diagnosis was no more than 12 months, so all the patients received previous treatment with hydroxyurea for which the median time was 3 months. The patients received imatinib mesylate in an effective oral dose of 400 to 800 mg daily, which was followed with peripheral blood counts, bone marrow examination, and cytogenetic studies at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. RESULTS: Complete hematologic responses were reported for 19 (90.48%) of 21 patients studied. Among 19 patients who had a response, 16 (86%) did so within 3 months. The best cytogenetic response rate at any time during the study treatment with imatinib mesylate, among 14 patients in which cytogenetic response evaluated was: complete cytogenetic response in 7 (50%) patients, partial cytogenetic response in 6 (42.9%) patients and minor cytogenetic response in 1 (7.1%) patient. No patients had progressed to accelerated or blastic phase. The most frequent adverse effects that seemed to be related to treatment with imatinib mesylate were edema and musculoskeletal pain; overall, most were mild. Only one patient discontinued treatment because of hematologic toxic effects. CONCLUSION: The results obtained in this study confirm that imatinib mesylate induces a complete hematological and cytogenetic response in a high percentage of patients with chronic-phase CML.",cancer
"Cytodiagnostic aspects of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma manifesting with small cell morphology on respiratory specimens: a case report. BACKGROUND: Exfoliation of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC) cells with small cell morphology in respiratory specimens can cause a diagnostic dilemma, particularly in patients with a history of bronchorrhea. CASE: A 59-year-old man presented with cough, breathlessness, and bronchorrhea. Clinically, he was diagnosed to have right-sided pulmonary consolidation. His sputum and bronchial washing specimens examined on multiple occasions revealed a varied number of single and loose aggregates of atypical cells, along with rare micropapillary and glandlike structures. The cells were small, round, and fairly monomorphic with a high nucleus to cytoplasm ratio and scant to moderate cytoplasm. Chromatin was uniformly distributed, with no appreciable nucleoli. At places, a vague nuclear molding was noted. Clinically, bronchorrhea and the diffuse infiltrative nature of the lesion favored BAC. Cytologically, prominent small cell morphology and nuclear molding suggested a possibility of small cell neuroendocrine tumor. However, careful cytologic examination of subsequent respiratory samples and biopsy revealed features of a nonmucinous type of BAC. CONCLUSION: Despite the small cell morphology of neoplastic cells on exfoliative respiratory cytology, a clinical history of bronchorrhea should prompt a cytodiagnosis of BAC. A glandlike arrangement of cells and greater amount of cytoplasm should also assist avoiding misinterpretation in such instances.",cancer
"Novel multitargeted anticancer oral therapies: sunitinib and sorafenib as a paradigm. The introduction of novel targeted therapies into the clinic in recent years has had a considerable impact on the management of several neoplastic diseases--such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors, hepatocellular carcinomas and renal cell carcinomas--considered until recently refractory to systemic therapies. We describe here two such novel biological agents, sunitinib and sorafenib, as a paradigm of the successful clinical application of new concepts. Sunitinib and sorafenib are small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, C-Kit and others. Both agents are administered orally; sunitinib is tyically given in cycles for 4 consecutive weeks with 2 weeks off, while sorafenib is given continually. Side effects occur in most patients, similar for both agents; they may affect several systems and organs but are mostly mild and easily manageable, rarely requiring discontinuation of the drug. However, these toxicities mandate prompt attention and intervention. The most frequently observed effects are hypertension, nausea, anorexia, asthenia and cutaneous manifestations; cardiac abnormalities may include congestive failure. Sunitinib, and markedly less frequently sorafenib, may cause thyroid gland dysfunction, mainly hypothyroidism. Antitumor activity has been shown for renal cell carcinoma in pivotal trials, for sunitinib as first-line treatment and for sorafenib in previously treated patients as second-line. Sunitinib is now approved as second-line therapy for patients with GIST refractory to imatinib; sorafenib has resulted in a significant prolongation in median survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Ongoing clinical trials will further define the spectrum of these agents' antitumor activity, their role in combination with other drugs, as well as their optimal dose and schedule of administration.",cancer
"Periodontal bone loss and self-reported medical conditions in a dental school patient population. PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of periodontal bone loss and to assess the prevalence of self-reported medical conditions in patients with and without periodontal bone loss in Saudi Arabia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 2103 dental records with complete data from patients > or = 18 years of age admitted to the King Abdulaziz University Faculty of Dentistry during the year 2005 were included. Age, gender, nationality and self reported medical history were abstracted from the dental records. Periodontal bone loss was determined by a single examiner using panoramic radiographs that were taken prior to any dental treatment. Descriptive statistics, t-test, chi-square and logistic regression models were used for data analyses. RESULTS: About 20% of the study sample reported a positive history for one or more medical conditions. Diabetes was the most frequently reported condition (7.4%), followed by hypertension (5.4%) and anemia (3%). Radiographic alveolar bone loss at one or more sites was found in 71.6% of the sample. The mean number of sites with alveolar bone loss was significantly higher among individuals with diabetes and hypertension than those without these conditions (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Prevalence of periodontal bone loss is high in the present sample, especially among those with chronic medical conditions. Collaboration between dental and medical professionals is needed for better oral and general health.",nocancer
"Simultaneous acute myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma successfully treated with allogeneic stem cell transplantation. We present a case of concurrent diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with multiple myeloma with complex karyotype, which was successfully treated with allogeneic stem cell transplantation. A 51-year-old man with no past medical history presented with fatigue and anemia with blasts on peripheral smear. Bone marrow biopsy confirmed the simultaneous diagnosis of myeloma and AML. The patient received bortezomib and the myeloma responded well, but induction chemotherapy for the AML failed twice. He underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant from his human lymphocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling, and is now disease-free approximately one year since the transplant. He has mild graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). To our knowledge, this is the first case of a patient with simultaneous AML and multiple myeloma who has undergone successful treatment with allogeneic stem cell transplantation.",cancer
"Methylation of the TFPI2 gene is frequently detected in advanced gastric carcinoma. BACKGROUND: Recently, Glockner et al. identified the methylation of TFPI2 as a frequent event in human colorectal cancer using a gene expression array-based strategy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Methylation status of the TFPI2 gene was examined in primary carcinomas and the corresponding normal tissues derived from 38 patients with gastric cancer using quantitative methylation-specific PCR (qMSP) and the correlation between the methylation status and the clinicopathological findings was evaluated. RESULTS: Aberrant methylation of the TFPI2 gene was detected in 7 out of 38 (18%) primary gastric carcinomas, suggesting that the methylation of TFPI2 is frequently observed in gastric carcinomas. The clinicopathological data were correlated with the methylation results. A significant difference was observed in maximal tumour size (p=0.0084), extent of tumour (p=0.0068), and TNM stage (p=0.0392). CONCLUSION: TFPI2 is frequently methylated in advanced gastric carcinomas.",cancer
"Fracture patterns of the nasal septum. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate fracture patterns of the nasal septum. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional cadaveric study. SETTING: Synthes research laboratories, Philadelphia, PA. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Eighteen cadavers were divided into three groups. Group A was subjected to low-level force administered to the nasal tip. Group B underwent moderate-level force and group C high-level force. Cadavers subsequently underwent dissection of the nose and nasal septum. RESULTS: Fracture patterns were apparent and related to the force applied. Fracture patterns were classified into three types depending on the location and extent. Group A was the most variable. Three cadavers were classified as type 1, two as type 2, and one as type 3. The average amount of force required to produce a fracture in this group was 100 N. Group B cadavers all developed type 3 fractures. Group C cadavers primarily developed type 3 fractures except for one that developed a type 1. Fractures were further classified in regard to the septum being displaced off the nasal spine. CONCLUSION: Based on our observation, we conclude that fracture patterns of the nasal septum do exist and appear to be related to the amount of force sustained.",nocancer
"Identifying neonatal and pediatric cardiac and congenital diaphragmatic hernia extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients at increased mortality risk. A previous review from our institution established clinically measured cut-points that defined the late implementation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) correlating to increased mortality in neonatal and pediatric respiratory patients. Using the same methods, this review evaluates pediatric and neonatal cardiac and congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) patients to determine if the same cut-points exist in this higher risk patient population. Neonatal and pediatric cardiac and CDH patients placed on ECMO between November 1989 and December 2008 were retrospectively reviewed to determine the first adjusted anion gap (AGc), the first venoarterial carbon dioxide (CO2) gradient (p[v-a]CO2), and the first Viability Index (AGc + p[v-a]CO2 = INDEX) on ECMO. These markers were then analyzed to identify the presence of specific cut-points that marked an increased risk of mortality. The timing of surgery was also reviewed to assess the surgical morbidity on survival. The review of neonatal and pediatric cardiac and CDH patients (n = 205) with an overall survival of 46% showed that all three markers were elevated to varying degrees in the expired patients (n = 110). Histograms identified the following specific cut-points for increased mortality: the AGc > or = 23 mEq/L, the p[v-a]CO2 _ 16 mmHg, and the INDEX > or = 28. An elevated AGc and INDEX correlated with a significantly higher risk for mortality (p < .05), survival to discharge being 20% or less. Patients under the cut-points had survival rates of 51% or higher. The timing of surgery (before or after ECMO initiation) did not significantly impact survival in the combined cardiac and CDH group. An INDEX > or = 28 correlates with non-survival. We speculate that the late implementation of ECMO may lead to reperfusion injury, which causes reduced survival, and that ECMO intervention prior to reaching the cut-points may improve survival in neonatal and pediatric cardiac and CDH patients.

"Cytomorphologic spectrum of mixed pituitary adenoma-gangliocytomas: a report of two cases. BACKGROUND: Mixed pituitary adenoma-gangliocytomas are rare tumors with a broad morphologic spectrum. Smear cytology is a useful tool for recognizing these tumors in an intraoperative setting. CASES: The patients were 45 and 30 years old, and both presented with headache. Intraoperative smears in both cases showed a tumor composed of adenomatous and neuronal elements, in varying proportions. The first case had sheets of monotonous neuroendocrine-type cells with occasional interspersed ganglion cells. The second case, however, had a prominent fibrillary background and was predominantly neurocytic, with a mixture of large ganglion-like cells, intermediate cells, and only rare adenomatous cells. CONCLUSION: The diagnostic features of mixed pituitary adenoma-gangliocytomas can be recognized on intraoperative smear preparations. Smear preparations are often more useful than frozen sections because freezing artifacts may mask one of the two components of the tumor. The proportion of adenomatous and neuronal elements can vary widely from case to case. Careful search for a neuronal component should be made, especially if there is a clinical history of a pituitary adenoma showing incomplete response to hormonal therapy.",cancer
"Does the dilated ascending aorta in an adult with congenital heart disease require intervention? OBJECTIVES: There is increasing attention to prophylactic replacement of the moderately dilated ascending aorta at aortic valve surgery. Moderate ascending aortic dilatation is common in adult patients with conotruncal anomalies. There are no data outlining actual risk of progressive ascending aortic dilatation or dissection to provide management guidelines. METHODS: From December 1973 through January 2008, 81 consecutive adults (median age, 34 years; range, 18--59 years) with conotruncal anomalies underwent operation on the aortic root, ascending aorta, or aortic valve. Primary cardiac diagnoses included tetralogy of Fallot with or without pulmonary atresia in 60 patients, truncus arteriosus in 12, double-outlet right ventricle in 6, and other in 3. Indications for operation included aortic regurgitation in 69 patients, supracoronary ascending aneurysm in 16, aortic stenosis in 5, and other in 8. Median ascending aortic size was 45 mm (23--80 mm). RESULTS: Operations included isolated aortic valve repair/replacement in 63 patients, combined aortic valve replacement and reduction aortoplasty in 9, aortic root replacement in 7, and isolated ascending aortic replacement in 2. Four patients required reoperation during a median follow-up of 3.8 years (maximum 31 years). There were no ascending aortic reoperations after previous reduction aortoplasties or supracoronary ascending aortic grafts, and there were no late aortic dissections. CONCLUSIONS: Moderate ascending aortic enlargement is common among patients with conotruncal anomalies coming to operation, but aortic dissection is rare, as is subsequent need for aortic reoperation. Despite current enthusiasm for prophylactic operations on the ascending aorta in patients with acquired disease, these data suggest that the moderately dilated aorta in this setting may be observed.",nocancer
"Groin recurrence following stage IA squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva with negative nodes on superficial inguinal lymphadenectomy. PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATION: Stage IA vulvar cancer with a depth of stromal invasion less than 1 mm is generally managed by wide local excision alone since there is less than 1% risk of lymph node involvement. CASE: A 62-year-old patient was admitted to a university hospital with a suspicious vulvar lesion. RESULTS: We present the first case of inguinal node and a possible contralateral pubic ramus recurrence following bilateral superficial inguinal lymphadenectomy and wide local resection for Stage 1A vulvar cancer. CONCLUSION: There is no evidence that extended radical surgery provides a better overall survival or reduces recurrence rate in Stage 1A vulvar carcinomas. Conservative vulvar resection and sentinel node dissection seem to be a rational choice. Nevertheless the disease may recur in the inguinal areas and frequently be lethal, therefore close surveillance and early attempts to treat the recurrent disease before infection and inflammation ensues should be the aim of current treatment strategies.",cancer
"Cancer incidence and mortality in the Czech Republic. BACKGROUNDS: The Czech Republic is ranked among those countries with the highest cancer burden in Europe and worldwide. The purpose of this study is to summarize long-term trends in the cancer burden and to provide up-to-date estimates of incidence and mortality rates from 2007. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Czech National Cancer Registry (CNCR) was instituted in 1977 and contains information over a 30-year period of standardized registration covering 100% of cancer diagnoses and the entire Czech population. The analysis of CNCR is supported by demographic data of the Czech Republic and by the Death Records Database as civil registration systems. The epidemiology of malignant tumours in the Czech population is available online at www.svod.cz. RESULTS: All neoplasms, including non-melanoma skin cancer, reached a crude incidence rate of almost 736 cases per 100,000 men and 648 cases per 100,000 women in 2007. The annual mortality rate exceeded 263 deaths per 100,000 population; each year, more than 27,000 persons die of cancer. The overall incidence of malignancies has increased during the last decade with growth index + 26.4% (1997-2007) while the mortality rate has stabilized over this time span (growth index in 1977-2007: -2.5%). Consequently, the prevalence has significantly increased in the registration period and in 2007 it exceeded 400,000 cases. In addition to the demographic ageing of the Czech population, the cancer burden is increased by the growing incidence of multiple primary tumours (recently more than 11% of the total incidence). The most frequent diagnoses include colorectal cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer and prostate cancer. Although some neoplasms are increasingly diagnosed at an early stage (e.g. proportion of stage I + II in female breast cancer: 71.9%, skin melanoma: 81.3%), in general early diagnostics is insufficient in the Czech Republic. This is the case even for highly prevalent colorectal carcinoma (only 43.2% of incident cases recently diagnosed at stage I or II). CONCLUSION: The Czech Republic is well equipped with high-quality and functional facilities for collecting and analysing population-based data on malignant tumours. The data survey has enabled the priorities of cancer management in the Czech Republic to be defined. This will undoubtedly lead to a sustained reduction in late diagnosed cases and a reduction in the remarkable regional differences in diagnostic efficiency.",cancer

"Factors predicting the quality of total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer. OBJECTIVE: To determine preoperative tumor-, patient-, and treatment-related factors that are independently associated with incomplete mesorectal excision. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Incomplete total mesorectal excision (TME) for rectal cancer is associated with increased local and overall recurrences. Factors predicting incomplete mesorectal excision have scarcely been studied. METHODS: In the context of PROCARE, a Belgian multidisciplinary project on rectal cancer, the quality of 266 consecutive and anonymized TME specimens submitted by 33 candidate-TME-trainers was graded by a blinded pathology review board in a standardized manner. Uni- and multivariable analysis were performed to identify factors that can independently predict incomplete mesorectal excision. RESULTS: Mesorectal resection was complete in 21%, nearly complete in 47%, and incomplete in 32%. Of 57% of TME specimens the grade of resection had not been reported by the local pathologist. Incomplete TME doubled the incidence of a positive circumferential resection margin (P = 0.004). Factors found to be significantly related to incomplete TME in univariate analysis were as follows: surgeon, female gender, pathologic body mass index, low rectal cancer, negative clinical nodal status, the absence of downstaging after long-course chemoradiation, laparoscopic and converted laparoscopic resection, and abdominoperineal resection. Multivariable analysis identified pathologic body mass index (P = 0.017), the absence of downstaging after long-course chemoradiation (P = 0.0005), and laparoscopic or converted laparoscopic resection (P = 0.014) as factors that are independently associated with incomplete mesorectal excision. CONCLUSION: Good TME quality cannot be guaranteed. This peer-reviewed TME assessment revealed a number of factors that are independently related to incomplete TME. Both specimen and pathology report need to be audited.",cancer
"The impact of auto-enrollment and automatic contribution escalation on retirement income adequacy. The results in this paper demonstrate the profound influence of plan design variables, as well as assumptions of employee behavior in auto-enrollment 401(k) plans. Even with a relatively simple definition of ""success,"" large differences in success rates can be seen, depending on which plan design factors and employee behavior assumptions are used: The probability of success for the lowest-income quartile increases from the baseline probability of 45.7 percent to 79.2 percent when all four factors are applied. The impact on the highest-income quartile is even more impressive, with an increase in the probability of success from 27.0 percent to 64.0 percent. When viewed in isolation, it is clear that the impact of increasing the limit on employee contributions is much greater than any of the other three factors. However, the importance of including one or more additional factors, along with the increase in the limit on employee contributions, can more than double the impact of increasing the limit by itself. This suggests that additional analysis of the influence of plan design variables on optimizing employee results is warranted. The next step in this project will include development of a plan-specific simulation model that will allow additional plan design variables.",nocancer
"Expression patterns of PAX5, c-Met, and paxillin in neuroendocrine tumors of the lung. CONTEXT: c-Met is important in the pathogenesis, invasion, and spread of several forms of lung cancer, and multiple c-Met inhibitors are undergoing clinical trials. PAX5 has been shown to upregulate c-Met in small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), and coinhibiting PAX5 and c-Met had a synergic effect in killing tumor cells. Paxillin is a downstream target of activated c-Met, and its activation leads to enhanced cell motility and tumor spread. The expression patterns of these functionally related proteins have not, to our knowledge, been systemically studied in neuroendocrine tumors of the lung. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression patterns of PAX5, paxillin, c-Met, and phosphorylated c-Met in 4 categories of pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors. DESIGN: Tissue microarrays of 38 typical carcinoids, 6 atypical carcinoids, 34 SCLCs, and 11 large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas were studied with immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Most of the 4 tumor types expressed c-Met, phosphorylated c-Met, and paxillin. PAX5 was frequently expressed in atypical carcinoids, SCLCs, and large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas but tended to be negative in typical carcinoids. Coexpression of PAX5 with c-Met or phosphorylated c-Met was present in most of the atypical carcinoids, SCLCs, and large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas. Significant correlation between PAX5 and paxillin was detected in SCLCs and large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas but not in carcinoid tumors. CONCLUSIONS: The frequent coexpression of PAX5 with c-Met or phosphorylated c-Met in intermediate-grade and high-grade neuroendocrine tumors supports the therapeutic strategy of coinhibiting these proteins. The discrepancy between high-grade and low-grade neuroendocrine tumors in PAX5/paxillin expression correlation may be due to the different underlying molecular genetics of these tumors.",cancer
"Centchroman mediated apoptosis involves cross-talk between extrinsic/intrinsic pathways and oxidative regulation. AIMS: Centchroman (CC) has been established as a potent antineoplastic agent in MCF-7 (ER+ve) and MDA MB-231 (ER-ve) Human Breast Cancer Cells (HBCCs) previously by us. To elucidate its antineoplastic action, we investigated the factors involved in cell-cycle progression and apoptosis. MAIN METHODS: Tamoxifen (TAM), a widely used antiestrogen was employed as a positive control. Role of Cycloheximide (CHX), Actinomycin-D (Act-D) and caspases were explored using specific inhibitors. Involvement of cell-cycle and apoptosis related factors were explored using western blotting and immunoprecipitation. KEY FINDINGS: Metabolic inhibitors viz. CHX, Act-D and pan-Caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK attenuated CC-induced apoptosis. The upregulation of both p21(Waf1/Cip1) and p27(Kip1) along with p21-CDK6 (Cyclin Dependent Kinase 6) and p21-PCNA (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen) interaction suggests their role in CC-induced cell-cycle arrest. The downregulation of Cyclin-D(1) and -E levels further confirms the antiestrogenic profile of CC. Unlike MDA MB-231, in MCF-7 cells, CC upregulates the level of phospho-p53 (Ser-15) and FasL, suggesting the involvement of extrinsic pathway. CC altered the intracytosolic balance of members of Bcl-2 family along with the cleavage of Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), Bcl-X(L), Bid and AIF (Apoptosis Inducing Factor). The evaluation of Mitogen Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs) using specific inhibitors and Western blotting confirms CC-induced the upregulation of phospho-c-Jun and phospho-p38. Additionally elevated SOD (Superoxide Dismutase) and unaltered CAT (Catalase) expression further suggest the involvement of oxidative stress. SIGNIFICANCE: These results confirm that the antineoplasticity of CC in MCF-7 and MDA MB-231 cells involves the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis along with oxidative stress.",cancer
Hysteroscopic diagnosis of a high-grade endometrial sarcoma in a 41-year-old woman. Endometrial stromal sarcomas originate in the endometrial cavity. These tumors represent between 15-27.9% of uterine sarcomas.

Histologic analysis of the polypoid mass removed by hysteroscopy was a high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma of the uterus. The description of this case provides an opportunity to review the literature on uterine sarcomas diagnosed by surgical hysteroscopy.,cancer
"Therapeutic options in patients with early T stage and advanced N stage of tonsillar squamous cell carcinomas. OBJECTIVE: To compare the therapeutic role of surgery followed by radiotherapy (OPRT) and concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in patients with early T (T1/T2) and advanced N (N2/N3) stage tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma. STUDY DESIGN: Historical cohort study. SETTING: A tertiary hospital. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The medical records of 42 patients who met the eligible criteria (24 patients were treated by OPRT, 18 patients by CCRT) were reviewed. RESULTS: Mean overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were 49.0 months and 43.0 months in OPRT group, respectively, and 39.6 months and 35.0 months in CCRT group, respectively (P = 0.18 for OS, P = 0.29 for DFS between the two groups). There was also no significant difference in survival estimates between OPRT and CCRT group in terms of two-year OS (P = 0.18) and two-year DFS (P = 0.45). In the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30, the scores for global health status and symptom scales did not differ between the two groups. However, the OPRT group reported better functional scales and significantly higher scores for cognitive (P = 0.008) and social function (P = 0.03). Among single items, a significantly lower score for insomnia (P = 0.007) was noted in the OPRT group. In EORTC QLQ-H&N35 modules, there were no significantly different scales between the two groups except scores for nutritional supplements, in which the OPRT group presented lower symptom scores (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: OPRT could be still a viable option for managing selected cases of advanced oropharyngeal cancer because one can expect comparable therapeutic outcome as well as quality of life.",cancer
"Expression of p16 in serous ovarian neoplasms. PURPOSE: We aimed to examine p16 protein expression in ovarian serous neoplasms along with normal ovarian tissues. MATERIALS AND METHODS: P16 expression was immunhistochemically evaluated in 86 ovarian serous neoplasms (21 cystadenomas, 20 borderline tumors and 45 carcinomas) and 21 non-neoplastic ovarian tissue. The results were also compared with histopathological grade in serous adenocarcinomas. RESULTS: P16 expression rates for benign, borderline ovarian tumors and ovarian cancer were 14.2%, 85% and 86.6%, respectively. It was significantly higher in carcinomas (p < 0.001) and borderline tumors (p < 0.001) compared to cystadenomas. No immunoreactivity was found in the non-neoplastic ovarian surface epithelial cells. The percentage of p16 expression did not change significantly with histological grade in carcinomas. CONCLUSION: P16 expression is strong and widespread involving most tumor cells in serous papillary ovarian carcinomas, and is probably an early event.",cancer

"HIV testing and treatment among tuberculosis patients --- Kenya, 2006-2009. In resource-limited settings, high case-fatality rates are seen among tuberculosis (TB) patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, especially during the early months of TB treatment. HIV prevalence among TB patients has been estimated to be as high as 80%--90% in some areas of sub-Saharan Africa. In 2004, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended increasing collaboration between HIV and TB programs. Since then, many countries, including Kenya, have worked to increase TB/HIV collaborative activities. In 2005, the Kenya Division of Leprosy, Tuberculosis, and Lung Disease (DLTLD) added questions regarding HIV testing and treatment to the existing TB surveillance system.* This report summarizes HIV data collected from Kenya's extended TB surveillance system during 2006--2009. During this period, HIV testing among TB patients increased from 60% in 2006 to 88% in 2009, and the prevalence of HIV infection among TB patients tested decreased from 52% to 44%. In 2009, 92% of HIV-infected TB patients received cotrimoxazole prophylaxis for the prevention of opportunistic infections. Although these data highlight the increase in HIV services provided to TB patients, only 34% of HIV-infected TB patients started antiretroviral therapy (ART) while being treated for TB. Innovative interventions are needed to increase HIV treatment among TB patients in Kenya, especially considering the 2009 WHO guidelines recommending that all HIV-infected TB patients be started on ART as soon as possible, regardless of CD4 count. Although these guidelines have not yet been implemented in Kenya, officials are working to identify methods of increasing access to ART for TB patients.",nocancer
"Bowel function and gastrointestinal quality of life among adults operated for Hirschsprung disease during childhood: a population-based study. OBJECTIVE: To assess bowel function and gastrointestinal quality of life among adults with operated Hirschsprung's disease (HD). SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Outcomes of HD extending to adulthood are unclear; bowel function and quality of life may deteriorate by aging. METHODS: Bowel function and gastrointestinal quality of life were cross-sectionally assessed in a population-based manner among adults operated for HD during childhood between 1950 and 1986. Patients were interviewed during their outpatient visit. Controls matched for age and sex were randomly chosen from the Population Register Centre of Finland. RESULTS: Ninety-two (64%) patients representative for the entire study population responded. The mean age of patients (79% male) was 43 (interquartile range [IQR], 35-48) years. Most (78%) had undergone Duhamel operation, and 94% had aganglionosis confined to the rectosigmoid. The mean overall bowel function score was decreased among patients (17.1 +/- 2.8 vs 19.1 +/- 1.2; P < 0.0001). They reported increased incidence of inability to hold back defecation (40% vs 17%), fecal soiling (48% vs 22%), constipation (30% vs 9%) and social problems related to bowel function (29% vs 11%; P < 0.05 for all). Gastrointestinal quality of life was only marginally lower among patients (121 +/- 15.3 vs 125 +/- 13.1; P = 0.0578) mainly because of significantly lower scores in questions assessing disease-specific factors such as bowel function and continence. Age was the only predictor of poor bowel function (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.00-1.14, P = 0.049), which weakly predicted gastrointestinal quality of life (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.66-1.01, P = 0.055). CONCLUSIONS: Although bowel function deteriorates with increasing age after operated HD, it is associated with only slightly decreased gastrointestinal quality of life.",nocancer
"Expression of master regulatory genes controlling skeletal development in benign cartilage and bone forming tumors. Recent progress in skeletal molecular biology has led to the clarification of the transcriptional mechanisms of chondroblastic and osteoblastic lineage differentiation. Three master transcription factors-Sox9, Runx2, and Osterix-were shown to play an essential role in determining the skeletal progenitor cells' fate. The present study evaluates the expression of these factors in 4 types of benign bone tumors-chondromyxoid fibroma, chondroblastoma, osteoid osteoma, and osteoblastoma-using immunohistochemistry and tissue microarrays. Osteoid osteoma and osteoblastoma showed strong nuclear expression of Osterix and Runx2. In contrast, only a few chondroblastomas showed positive nuclear expression of Osterix. Strong nuclear expression of Sox9 was detected in all chondroblastomas, whereas nearly half of the osteoblastomas showed focal weak cytoplasmic expression of Sox9.",cancer
"Fine needle cytology and flow cytometry of ectopic cervical thymoma: a case report. BACKGROUND: A case of ectopic cervical thymoma (ECT) in which fine needle cytology (FNC) and flow cytometry (FC) have orientated the cytologic diagnosis, is described. CASE: A 57-year-old woman underwent FNC of a right latero-cervical nodule. The smear showed a dispersed lymphoid-cell population; therefore, a second FNC was used for FC and to prepare a cell block. Smears were highly cellular. Cells were medium or large sized, with scanty cytoplasm and nuclei with dispersed chromatin; large cells showed evident nucleoli. Immunohistochemistry on additional smears were positive for CD45RO and Ki67 in most of the cells, and negative for CK pan, CD20, thyreoglobulin and calcitonin. FC showed the following phenotype: CD2/CD3/CD7 = 67%, CD10 = 61%, CD4/CD8 = 62%. CD19 and light chains were not expressed. A diagnosis of T-cell lymphoid proliferation was made and ECT was suggested; histological diagnosis was cervical ectopic benign type B1 thymoma. CONCLUSION: FC may support the FNC diagnosis of ECT because of the specific phenotype of lymphoid cells showing the profile of ""polyclonal"" (CD2/CD3/CD7+) and thymic T-cells (CD10+, CD4/CD6+). FNC and FC may suggest the diagnosis of ECT even in the absence of detectable epithelial cells.",cancer
"Recombinant human thyrotropin (rhTSH) aided radioiodine treatment for residual or metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer. BACKGROUND: For patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) following thyroidectomy, thyroid hormone withdrawal (THW) for four to six weeks has been used for decades to increase serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations in order to enhance iodine-131 uptake by normal thyroid cells and differentiated thyroid tumour cells. Exogenous stimulation with recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone (rhTSH) offers an alternative to THW while avoiding the morbidity of hypothyroidism. However, the efficacy of rhTSH-aided iodine-131 treatment for residual or metastatic DTC has not been prospectively assessed. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of rhTSH-aided radioiodine treatment for normal residual or metastatic DTC. SEARCH STRATEGY: We obtained studies from computerised searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library (all until November 2009), and paper collections of conferences held in Chinese. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled clinical trials and quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials comparing the effects of rhTSH with THW on iodine-131 treatment for residual or metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer with at least six months of follow up. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Altogether 223 patients with DTC participated in four trials. Overall, studies had a high risk of bias. We found no statistically significant differences between rhTSH and THW treatment in terms of successful ablation rate but significant benefits in radiation exposure to blood and bone marrow. One trial reported on benefits in some domains of health-related quality of life. There were no deaths and no serious adverse effects in DTC patients treated with either rhTSH or THW. Maximum follow up was 12 months. None of the included trials investigated complete or partial remission of metastatic tumour, secondary malignancies or economic outcomes. We did not find sufficient data comparing rhTSH with THW-aided radioiodine treatment for metastatic DTC. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Results from four randomised controlled clinical trials suggest that rhTSH is as effective as THW on iodine-131 thyroid remnant ablation, with limited data on significant benefits in decreased whole body radiation exposure and health-related quality of life. It is still uncertain whether lower iodine-131 doses (1110 MBq or 1850 MBq versus 3700 MBq) are equally effective for remnant ablation under rhTSH stimulation. Randomised controlled clinical trials are needed to guide treatment selection for metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer.",cancer
"The effectiveness and adverse effects profile of ""burst"" ketamine in refractory cancer pain: The VCOG PM 1-00 study. This multi-centre study of adjuvant ""burst"" ketamine in palliative care in-patients documents its effectiveness, duration of pain relief, and adverse effects (AE) profile. Patients received a three-to-five day continuous subcutaneous infusion (CSCI) of ketamine escalated from 100 to 300 to 500 mg/24 hours if required. When the effective or maximum tolerated dose was attained, the infusion was continued for three days and each patient assessed as a responder or non-responder using strict criteria. The response rate was 22/44 (50 percent), with 4 (9 percent) becoming pain-free. Pain relief lasting two or more weeks was documented in 50 percent of responders. AEs were documented daily using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria 0-4 scales. There were 11 grade 3 and 4 neurological AEs. However, no responders elected to cease treatment early due to neurological AEs. We concluded that this protocol in the controlled environment of an in-patient PC unit is relatively safe and simple with reasonable effectiveness.",cancer
"Monitoring microemboli during cardiopulmonary bypass with the EDAC quantifier. Gaseous emboli may be introduced into the bypass circuit both from the surgical field and during perfusionist interventions. While circuits provide good protection against massive air embolism, they do not remove gaseous microemboli (GME) from the bypass circuit. The purpose of this preliminary study is to assess the incidence of GME during bypass surgery and determine if increased GME counts were associated with specific events during bypass surgery. In 30 cases divided between 15 coronary artery bypass grafts and 15 valve repairs, GME were counted and sizedt the three locations on the bypass circuit using the EDAC"" Quantifier (Luna Innovations, Roanoke, VA). A mean of 45,276 GME were detected after the arterial line filter during these 30 cases, with significantly more detected (p = .04) post filter during valve cases (mean = 72,137 +/- 22,113) than coronary artery bypass graft cases (mean = 18,416 +/- 7831). GME detected post filter were significantly correlated in time with counts detected in the venous line (p < .001). Specific events associated with high counts included the initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass, heart manipulations, insertion and removal of clamps, and the administration of drugs. Global factors associated with increased counts post filter included higher venous line counts and higher post reservoir/bubble trap counts. The mean number of microemboli detected during bypass surgery was much higher than reported in other studies of emboli incidence, most likely due to the increased sensitivity of the EDAC Quantifier compared to other detection modalities. The results furthermore suggest the need for further study of the clinical significance of these microemboli and what practices may be used to reduce GME incidence. Increased in vitro testing of the air handling capability of different circuit designs, along with more clinical studies assessing best clinical practices for reducing GME activity, is recommended.",nocancer
"Dental education and dentists' attitudes and behavior concerning patients with autism. The number of patients diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in the United States has increased significantly. The objectives of this study were to explore general and pediatric dentists' professional attitudes and behavior towards patients with ASD; these dentists' perceptions of their dental education about these issues; and the relationships among their educational experiences, attitudes, and behaviors concerning patients with ASD. Survey data were collected from 162 general dentists in Michigan and 212 pediatric dentists across the United States. The results showed that 89 percent of pediatric dentists and 32 percent of general dentists treat patients with ASD. The respondents disagreed with statements indicating that their predoctoral dental education had prepared them well to treat patients with ASD. However, the better they felt prepared, the more likely they were to provide care for these patients. The frequency with which pediatric dentists said they use appropriate behavior management strategies when treating patients with ASD correlated with the quality of their educational experiences. In conclusion, given the growing number of patients with ASD, it is important to revisit dental education efforts targeted towards preparing future dental care providers for the treatment of patients with ASD and special needs.",nocancer

"Clinical significance of molecular biomarkers in glioblastoma. AIM: To review the impact of molecular biomarkers on response to therapy and survival in patients with primary glioblastoma (GBM). MATERIALS & METHODS: Tissue specimens were analyzed for p53 mutations, EGFR amplification, loss of PTEN and p16, and O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation. Demographic and clinical data were gathered from medical records. RESULTS: Clinical and pathological data of 125 patients were collected and analysed. MGMT promoter methylation was associated with improved median overall survival (OS) (61 vs. 42 weeks, p = 0.01) and was an important prognosticator independent of age at diagnosis, extent of resection and post-operative ECOG performance status (HR 2.04, 95% CI 1.11-3.75). Among patients with MGMT promoter methylation, survival was significantly improved with chemoradiotherapy (CRT) over radiotherapy (RT) alone (71 vs. 14 weeks, p < 0.01). Furthermore, amongst those treated with temozolomide (TMZ) based CRT, the presence of EGFR amplification, maintenance of PTEN and wild-type p53 and p16 were each associated with trends towards improved survival. CONCLUSION: MGMT promoter methylation is a strong, independent prognostic factor for OS in GBM. EGFR amplification, maintenance of PTEN, wild-type p53 and p16 all appear to be associated with improved survival in patients treated with CRT. However, the prognostic value of these biomarkers could not be ascertained and larger prospective studies are warranted.",cancer
"Protection of ovarian tissue from radiotherapy. Advances researches in the diagnosis and treatment of childhood, adolescent and adult cancer have greatly increased the life expectancy of premenopausal women with cancer. However, one of the serious side effects of these treatments is the risk of damage to fertility. The ovaries are very sensitive to cytotoxic and radiotherapeutic treatment. The only established method of fertility preservation is embryo cryopreservation according to the Ethics Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (2005), but this option requires the patient to be of pubertal age, have a partner or use donor sperm, and be able to undergo a cycle of ovarian stimulation, which is not possible when the radiotherapy has to be initiated immediately or when stimulation is contraindicated according to the type of cancer. For patients who need immediate radiotherapy, cryopreservation of ovarian tissue is the only possible alternative. This manuscript reports the different techniques of cryopreservation and the results of transplantation of cryopreserved ovarian tissue. The current techniques allow cryopreservation of human ovarian fragments for a long time with good follicular survival rate after thawing. Numerous studies ultimately in this field have demonstrated to improve the survival rate of the oocytes and cryopreserved follicles. Moreover this manuscript includes a case of a 17-year-old girl who had to undergo pelvic irradiation for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and the laparoscopic treatment to preserve the fertility (Fig. 2, Ref. 47).",cancer
"Does hepatic pedicle clamping affect disease-free survival following liver resection for colorectal metastases? OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of liver ischemia from hepatic pedicle clamping (HPC) on long-term outcome after hepatectomy for colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). BACKGROUND: Liver resection offers the only chance of cure for patients with CRLM. Several clinical and pathologic factors have been reported as determinants of poor outcome after hepatectomy for CRLM. A controversial issue is that hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury from HPC may adversely affect long-term outcome by accelerating the outgrowth of residual hepatic micrometastases. METHODS: Patients undergoing liver resection for CRLM in 2 tertiary referral centers, between 1992 and 2008, were included. Disease-free survival and specific liver-free survival were analyzed according to the use, type, and duration of HPC. RESULTS: Five hundred forty-three patients had primary hepatectomy for CRLM. Hepatic pedicle clamping was performed in 355 patients (65.4%), and intermittently applied in 254 patients (71.5%). Postoperative mortality and morbidity rates were 1.3% and 18.5%, respectively. Hepatic pedicle clamping had a highly significant impact in reducing the risk of blood transfusions and was not correlated with significantly higher postoperative morbidity. Liver recurrence rate was not significantly different according to the use, type, and duration of HPC, in patients resected after preoperative chemotherapy as well. On univariate analysis, HPC did not significantly affect overall and disease-free survival. These results were confirmed on the multivariate analysis where blood transfusions, primary tumor nodal involvement, and the size of CRLM of more than 5 cm prevailed as determinants of poor outcome. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the safety and effectiveness of HPC and demonstrates that in the human situation, there is no evidence that HPC may adversely affect long-term outcome after hepatectomy for CRLM.",cancer
"Family caregivers of palliative cancer patients at home: the puzzle of pain management. The purpose of this grounded theory study was to understand the processes used by family caregivers to manage the pain of cancer patients at home. A total of 24 family caregivers participated. They were recruited using purposeful then theoretical sampling. The data sources were taped, transcribed (semi-structured) interviews and field notes. Data analysis was based on Strauss and Corbin's (1998) requirements for open, axial, and selective coding. The result was an explanatory model titled ""the puzzle of pain management,"" which includes four main processes: ""drawing on past experiences""; ""strategizing a game plan""; ""striving to respond to pain""; and ""gauging the best fit,"" a decision-making process that joins the puzzle pieces. Understanding how family caregivers assemble their puzzle pieces can help health care professionals make decisions related to the care plans they create for pain control and help them to recognize the importance of providing information as part of resolving the puzzle of pain management.",cancer

"Hemoperitoneum caused by a bleeding myoma in pregnancy. The prevalence of uterine myomas during pregnancy is estimated to range from 0.3% to 2.6%. Although leiomyomas usually remain asymptomatic, in one often cases they may be complicated. The management of uterine fibroids during pregnancy is largely conservative and surgical removal is generally delayed until post partum. A 37-year-old pregnant woman (15 weeks) with a history of gynecologic examination several hours before presented with lower abdominal pain and signs of acute abdomen. She was para-2, as she had delivered a healthy child 12 years before, and current pregnancy was uncomplicated until presentation. Intra-abdominal hemorrhage was suspected and she underwent immediate exploratory laparotomy, which revealed massive hemoperitoneum. A subserous uterine leiomyoma of 8.5x6.5 cm was found in the fundus area, with an actively bleeding ruptured vessel on its dome. Myomectomy was successfully performed and 1.5 liter of blood and blood clots were evacuated from the peritoneal cavity. The histology report showed sections of interlacing bundles of smooth muscles with areas of bleeding and necrotic degeneration. The postoperative course and subsequent antenatal period were uneventful. The woman went into spontaneous labor at 38 weeks and delivered vaginally a healthy male baby. This rare case ofintra-abdominal hemorrhage due to bleeding myoma supports other recent studies, which have demonstrated that myomectomy may be successfully performed during pregnancy in selected circumstances.",cancer
"Targeted intervention strategies to increase and maintain mammography utilization among African American women. OBJECTIVES: We assessed the impact of a theory-based, culturally relevant intervention designed to increase mammography screening among African American women in 8 underserved counties in Alabama. METHODS: Using principles derived from the Stages of Change, Community Health Advisor, and Community Empowerment models, we developed strategies to increase mammography screening. Trained volunteers (N = 143) provided tailored messages to encourage adoption and maintenance of mammography screening. We collected baseline and follow-up data on 1513 women in the communities targeted for the intervention. Our goal was to decrease the number of women in stage 1 (never screened) while increasing the number of women in stage 2 (infrequently screened) and stage 3 (regularly screened). RESULTS: At baseline, 14% (n = 211) of the women were in stage 1, 16% (n = 247) were in stage 2, and 70% (n = 1055) were in stage 3. After the 2-year intervention, 4% (n = 61) of the women remained in stage 1, 20% (n = 306) were in stage 2, and 76% (n = 1146) were in stage 3. CONCLUSIONS: Tailored motivational messages and peer support can increase mammography screening rates for African American women.",cancer

"The UV index: definition, distribution and factors affecting it. The UV Index was introduced in Canada in 1992 in response to growing concerns about the potential increase of ultraviolet (UV) radiation due to ozone depletion. The index was adopted as a standard indicator of UV levels by the World Meteorological Organization and World Health Organization in 1994. This survey article gives an overview of the UV Index and the main features of its geographical distribution. UV index values are determined from measurements made by ground-based spectrometers, broad-band filter radiometers and multi-filter radiometers. Radiative transfer models are used to estimate UV Index values from other types of geophysical observations, primarily column ozone and cloud thickness. UV Index values can also be retrieved from satellite measurements of atmospheric ozone and cloud cover. Forecasts of UV Index values are now widely available and are intended to be used by the public as a guide to avoid excessive exposure to UV radiation. Over the US and Canada, mean noontime UV Index values in summer range from 1.5 in the Arctic to 11.5 over southern Texas and can be as high as 20 at high elevations in Hawaii. The UV Index is also often used to quantify UV levels in studies investigating the impact of UV on other biological and photochemical processes. Factors affecting the UV Index, such as the sun elevation, total amount of ozone in the atmosphere, cloud cover, reflection from snow and local pollution, are also discussed. Since its introduction in 1992, the UV Index has become a widely used parameter to characterize solar UV. Information about it can be useful for helping people avoid excessive levels of UV radiation.",cancer
"Oxidation of thiols and modification of redox-sensitive signaling in human lung epithelial cells exposed to Pseudomonas pyocyanin. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of pyocyanin exposure on mitochondrial GSH, other cellular thiols (thioredoxin-1, Trx-1), and oxidant-sensitive signaling pathways hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1alpha) and heme oxygenase (HO-1) in A549 and HBE cell lines. A549 human type II alveolar epithelial cells and human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells were treated with varying concentrations of pyocyanin extracted from Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria. Cytoplasmic and mitochondrial thiols and oxidant sensitive signal transduction proteins (HIF-1alpha and HO-1) were measured. Exposure to pyocyanin generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cellular mitochondria and altered total cellular glutathione (GSH). Pyocyanin, at concentrations present in conditions in vivo, increased oxidized Trx-1 in A549 human type II alveolar epithelial cells and HBE cells by 184 and 74%, respectively. Oxidized mitochondrial glutathione (GSSG) was elevated more than twofold in both cell types. Pyocyanin also increased the cellular oxidant-sensitive proteins HIF-1alpha and HO-1. Data indicate that pyocyanin-induced alterations in mitochondrial and cytosolic thiols, as well as oxidant-sensitive proteins, may contribute to P. aeruginosa-mediated lung injury.",nocancer

"Physically and sexually violent experiences of reproductive-aged women displaced by Hurricane Katrina. PURPOSE: Measure the frequency of physical and sexual abuse in a sample of reproductive aged women displaced by Hurricane Katrina, and compare those experiences to the year before Hurricane Katrina. METHODS: Sixty-six English-speaking women aged 18-49 years residing in Louisiana Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) housing were screened for physical and sexual abuse seven to nine months after Hurricane Katrina, using modified 30x7 cluster sampling methodology. FINDINGS: Twenty-three percent (95% confidence interval [CI], 14, 34%) of women reported being hit or verbally threatened since Hurricane Katrina. Abuse had increased for 33% (95% CI, 13, 63%) and decreased for 13% (95% CI, 4, 37%) of women. Twenty percent (95% CI, 6, 51%) of abused women were with a new partner, while 13% (95% CI, 4, 39%) reported new abuse with the same partner. Four women reported sexual abuse since Hurricane Katrina. Compared to before the storm, the frequency of sexual abuse was the same for two women, and one reported new abuse with the same partner. CONCLUSIONS: Physical abuse was not uncommon among displaced women following Hurricane Katrina. Increasing and new abuse were the most commonly reported experiences. Violence against women should not be overlooked as a continued, and perhaps escalating, occurrence requiring attention following displacement after disasters of such magnitude as Hurricane Katrina.",nocancer
"Recombinant human erythropoietin antagonizes trastuzumab treatment of breast cancer cells via Jak2-mediated Src activation and PTEN inactivation. We found that the receptor for erythropoietin (EpoR) is coexpressed with human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) in a significant percentage of human breast tumor specimens and breast cancer cell lines. Exposure of HER2 and EpoR dual-positive breast cancer cells to recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) activated cell signaling. Concurrent treatment of the cells with rHuEPO and trastuzumab reduced the cells' response to trastuzumab both in vitro and in vivo. We identified Jak2-mediated activation of Src and inactivation of PTEN as underlying mechanisms through which rHuEPO antagonizes trastuzumab-induced therapeutic effects. Furthermore, we found that compared with administration of trastuzumab alone, concurrent administration of rHuEPO and trastuzumab correlated with shorter progression-free and overall survival in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.",cancer
"VMC++ validation for photon beams in the energy range of 20-1000 keV. PURPOSE: In high energy teletherapy, VMC++ is known to be a very accurate and efficient Monte Carlo (MC) code. In principle, the MC method is also a powerful dose calculation tool in other areas in radiation oncology, e.g., brachytherapy or orthovoltage radiotherapy. However, VMC++ is not validated for the low-energy range of such applications. This work aims in the validation of the VMC++ MC code for photon beams in the energy range between 20 and 1000 keV. METHODS: Dose calculations were performed in different 40 x 40 x 40 cm3 phantoms of different materials. Dose distributions of monoenergetic (ranging from 20 to 1000 keV) 10 x 10 and 2 x 2 cm2 parallel beams were calculated. Voxel sizes of 4 x 4 x 4 and 1 x 1 x 1 mm3 were used for the dose calculations. The resulting dose distributions were compared to those calculated using EGSnrc, which is used as a golden standard in this work. RESULTS: At energies between 100 and 1000 keV, EGSnrc and VMC++ calculated dose distributions agree within the statistical uncertainty of about 1% (1sigma). At energies < or = 50 keV, dose differences of up to 1.6% (in % of D(max)) occur when VMC++ and EGSnrc are compared. Turning off Rayleigh scattering, binding effects for Compton scattering, and the atomic relaxation after photoelectric absorption in EGSnrc (all not implemented in VMC++) leads to an agreement between both MC codes within statistical uncertainty. Further, using the KERMA approximation feature implemented in VMC++ leads to very efficient simulations in the energy range between 20 and 1000 keV. CONCLUSIONS: Further improvements for very low energies in accuracy of VMC++ could be achieved by implementing Rayleigh scattering, binding effects for Compton scattering, and the atomic relaxation after photoelectric absorption. Implementation into VMC++ of KERMA approximation has been validated.",cancer

"Most pregnant women in California do not receive dental care: findings from a population-based study. OBJECTIVES: We examined the prevalence of dental care during pregnancy and reasons for lack of care. METHODS: Using a population-based survey of 21,732 postpartum women in California during 2002-2007, we calculated prevalence of dental problems, receipt of care, and reasons for non-receipt of care. We used logistic regression to estimate odds of non-receipt of care by maternal characteristics. RESULTS: Overall, 65% of women had no dental visit during pregnancy; 52% reported a dental problem prenatally, with 62% of those women not receiving care. After adjustment, factors associated with non-receipt of care included non-European American race/ethnicity, lack of a college degree, lack of private prenatal insurance, no first-trimester prenatal insurance coverage, lower income, language other than English spoken at home, and no usual source of pre-pregnancy medical care. The primary reason stated for non-receipt of dental care was lack of perceived need, followed by financial barriers. CONCLUSIONS: Most pregnant women in this study received insufficient dental care. Odds were elevated not only among the poorest, least educated mothers, but also among those with moderate incomes or some college education. The need for dental care during pregnancy must be promoted widely among both the public and providers, and financial barriers to dental care should be addressed.",nocancer

"Neoplastic ascites in osteosarcoma: a case report. BACKGROUND: Osteosarcoma is a malignant tumor of connective tissue whose tumor cells produce bone tissue. It can be classified as osteoblastic, chondroblastic, or fibroblastic, according to the predominant histologic type of cells. Its dissemination is hematogenous, and the lungs are the most frequent site of clinically evident metastasis. Extrapulmonary metastases are rare and more frequently diagnosed at necropsy. We present a case of osteosarcoma with peritoneal dissemination that developed neoplastic ascites. CASE: A 46-year-old patient came to the hospital with a 4-month history of lumbar pain and weakness in the lower limbs. Computed tomography showed blastic lesions in the L3 vertebral body. Surgical resection and histologic analysis revealed a mixed osteoblastic and chondroblastic osteosarcoma. After only one session of chemotherapy, the patient presented a marked clinical worsening with extensive metastatic dissemination and occurrence of voluminous ascites. The cytologic examination of the ascitic fluid demonstrated frequent poorly differentiated tumor cells. The patient died a little more than 2 months after the diagnosis.

"Isolated groin recurrence in vulval squamous cell cancer (VSCC). The importance of node count. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is a node count which can define an adequate inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy (IFL) in primary VSCC. METHODS: A retrospective and prospective review of patients with node negative VSCC who had a full staging IFL. Detection of isolated groin recurrences (IGR) would allow groins with higher risk of groin recurrence to be identified. RESULTS: The median node count of 228 IFLs in 139 patients was eight (0-24). There were six IGR (4.3%). Increased rate of IGR was present in patients with increased age, tumour diameter and depth of invasion, lymphovascular space invasion, unilateral IFL, and moderate/poor tumour grade. In the 138 groins with node counts of eight or greater there were no IGRs compared to six in the patients with either undissected groins or groin node counts less than eight (p = 0.030) Interval to IGR was significantly shorter than other sites of recurrence. Both disease-specific and overall survival were significantly reduced in IGR. CONCLUSIONS: An inadequate IFL is a nodal count of less than eight per groin; both these groins and undissected groins are at increased risk of IGR and should have close surveillance.",cancer
"Coupled mathematical model of tumorigenesis and angiogenesis in vascular tumours. OBJECTIVES: Mathematical models are useful for studying vascular and avascular tumours, because these allow for more logical experimental design and provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of their growth and development. The processes of avascular tumour growth and the development of capillary networks through tumour-induced angiogenesis have already been extensively investigated, albeit separately. Despite the clinical significance of vascular tumours, few studies have combined these approaches to develop a single comprehensive growth and development model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We develop a continuum-based mathematical model of vascular tumour growth. In the model, angiogenesis is initiated through the release of angiogenic growth factors (AGFs) by cells in the hypoxic regions of the tumour. The nutrient concentration within the tumour reflects the influence of capillary growth and invasion induced by AGF. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Parametric and sensitivity studies were performed to evaluate the influence of different model parameters on tumour growth and to identify the parameters with the most influence, which include the rates of proliferation, apoptosis and necrosis, as well as the diffusion of sprout tips and the size of the region affected by angiogenesis. An optimization was performed for values of the model parameters that resulted in the best agreement with published experimental data. The resulting model solution matched the experimental data with a high degree of correlation (r = 0.85).",cancer

"Human paragonimiasis after eating raw or undercooked crayfish --- Missouri, July 2006-September 2010. Paragonimiasis is a parasitic disease caused by Paragonimus trematodes, commonly known as lung flukes. Humans become infected by eating raw or undercooked crayfish (also known as crawfish and crawdads) or freshwater crabs that harbor the parasites. Paragonimiasis most frequently involves the lungs, but can affect other organs, including the brain and skin. In North America, Paragonimus kellicotti causes infections among dogs, cats, and wild carnivores, but rarely infects humans. Paragonimiasis is not a nationally notifiable condition. In September 2009, physicians from the Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) in St. Louis published details of three paragonimiasis cases diagnosed since July 2006 in persons who had eaten raw crayfish from rivers in Missouri, prompting the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services (MDHSS), CDC, and WUSM to collaborate in paragonimiasis surveillance and prevention. During September 2009-September 2010, six additional cases were diagnosed in Missouri. These nine patients, aged 10-32 years, had fever, cough, pleural effusion, and eosinophilia. All had eaten raw or undercooked crayfish from rivers in Missouri while on canoeing or camping trips within 4 months of illness onset.

CONTEXT: Many potential donor lungs deteriorate between the time of brain death and evaluation for transplantation suitability, possibly because of the ventilatory strategy used after brain death. OBJECTIVE: To test whether a lung protective strategy increases the number of lungs available for transplantation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Multicenter randomized controlled trial of patients with beating hearts who were potential organ donors conducted at 12 European intensive care units from September 2004 to May 2009 in the Protective Ventilatory Strategy in Potential Lung Donors Study. Interventions Potential donors were randomized to the conventional ventilatory strategy (with tidal volumes of 10-12 mL/kg of predicted body weight, positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP] of 3-5 cm H(2)O, apnea tests performed by disconnecting the ventilator, and open circuit for airway suction) or the protective ventilatory strategy (with tidal volumes of 6-8 mL/kg of predicted body weight, PEEP of 8-10 cm H(2)O, apnea tests performed by using continuous positive airway pressure, and closed circuit for airway suction). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The number of organ donors meeting eligibility criteria for harvesting, number of lungs harvested, and 6-month survival of lung transplant recipients. RESULTS: The trial was stopped after enrolling 118 patients (59 in the conventional ventilatory strategy and 59 in the protective ventilatory strategy) because of termination of funding. The number of patients who met lung donor eligibility criteria after the 6-hour observation period was 32 (54%) in the conventional strategy vs 56 (95%) in the protective strategy (difference of 41% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 26.5% to 54.8%]; P <.001). The number of patients in whom lungs were harvested was 16 (27%) in the conventional strategy vs 32 (54%) in the protective strategy (difference of 27% [95% CI, 10.0% to 44.5%]; P = .004). Six-month survival rates did not differ between recipients who received lungs from donors ventilated with the conventional strategy compared with the protective strategy (11/16 [69%] vs 24/32 [75%], respectively; difference of 6% [95% CI, -22% to 32%]). CONCLUSION: Use of a lung protective strategy in potential organ donors with brain death increased the number of eligible and harvested lungs compared with a conventional strategy.

"Assessing pediatric trauma specimen integrity. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the quality of trauma specimens by comparing line draws to venipuncture. DESIGN: The draw type (line or venipuncture); container type (Vacutainer or Microtainer); and suitability for processing (processed/hemolyzed/clotted) of routinely collected trauma specimens was analyzed. SETTING: The clinical laboratory of a Level I Pediatric Trauma Center. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Hemolyzed trauma specimens were analyzed according to method of collection, collector, and type of container to identify issues resulting in unusable samples. RESULTS: The data shows that for 13% of all draws, portions of the results were affected by hemolysis. Sixteen percent of line draws and 6% of venipunctures were hemolyzed (p = 0.04). There was no statistical association with who collected the sample (p = 0.07) or type of container (p = 1.00). CONCLUSION: Based on this sample of data, the laboratory recommends that, whenever possible, venipunctures be performed for laboratory testing of blood specimens to improve trauma specimen integrity.",nocancer
"Serum retinol-binding protein-4 levels in polycystic ovary syndrome patients undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for in-vitro fertilization cycle. AIMS: To determine serum retinol-binding rotein 4 (RBP-4) levels in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) for an in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) cycle and the possible correlation to COH variables. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 11 consecutive PCOS patients undergoing our routine IVF flexible multidose gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-antagonist protocol. Blood was drawn three times during the COH cycle: (1) day 1 or 2 of menstruation, and prior to gonadotropin administration (Day-S) (Day-S); (2) day of or prior to human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration (Day-hCG); and (3) day of ovum pick-up (Day-OPU). Levels of estradiol and serum RBP-4 were compared among the three time points. Serum RBP-4 was measured with a commercial immunoassay. RESULTS: Results showed significantly lower levels of serum RBP-4 on Day-OPU and Day-hCG than on Day-S. Though significant correlations were observed between serum RBP-4 and body mass index, fasting glucose or glucose to insulin ratio, no correlations were found between serum RBP-4 and IVF treatment variables or pregnancy rate. CONCLUSION: While serum RBP-4 decreases during COH for IVF, there is apparently no correlation of serum RBP-4 levels with IVF treatment variables or outcome.",cancer
"Weight lifting for women at risk for breast cancer-related lymphedema: a randomized trial. CONTEXT: Clinical guidelines for breast cancer survivors without lymphedema advise against upper body exercise, preventing them from obtaining established health benefits of weight lifting. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate lymphedema onset after a 1-year weight lifting intervention vs no exercise (control) among survivors at risk for breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized controlled equivalence trial (Physical Activity and Lymphedema trial) in the Philadelphia metropolitan area of 154 breast cancer survivors 1 to 5 years postunilateral breast cancer, with at least 2 lymph nodes removed and without clinical signs of BCRL at study entry. Participants were recruited between October 1, 2005, and February 2007, with data collection ending in August 2008. INTERVENTION: Weight lifting intervention included a gym membership and 13 weeks of supervised instruction, with the remaining 9 months unsupervised, vs no exercise. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incident BCRL determined by increased arm swelling during 12 months (>/=5% increase in interlimb difference). Clinician-defined BCRL onset was also evaluated. Equivalence margin was defined as doubling of lymphedema incidence. RESULTS: A total of 134 participants completed follow-up measures at 1 year. The proportion of women who experienced incident BCRL onset was 11% (8 of 72) in the weight lifting intervention group and 17% (13 of 75) in the control group (cumulative incidence difference [CID], -6.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -17.2% to 5.2%; P for equivalence = .04). Among women with 5 or more lymph nodes removed, the proportion who experienced incident BCRL onset was 7% (3 of 45) in the weight lifting intervention group and 22% (11 of 49) in the control group (CID, -15.0%; 95% CI, -18.6% to -11.4%; P for equivalence = .003). Clinician-defined BCRL onset occurred in 1 woman in the weight lifting intervention group and 3 women in the control group (1.5% vs 4.4%, P for equivalence = .12). CONCLUSION: In breast cancer survivors at risk for lymphedema, a program of slowly progressive weight lifting compared with no exercise did not result in increased incidence of lymphedema.

"Effects of ILTG on DAPK1 promoter methylation in colon and leukemia cancer cell lines. AIMS: The aim of this study was to describe quantitatively the potential demethylating effects of the plant-derived compound isoliquritigenin (ILTG) on the death-associated protein kinase-1 (DAPK1) promoter region of colon cancer and leukemia cell lines. METHODS: Methylation-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction-melting curve analysis (MSP-MCA) was the primary method used. A simple cytotoxicity assay and an ethidium bromide displacement assay were used to evaluate the chemopreventive indices and account for any problems in fluorometric assessment caused by intercalating potential of the compound of interest. RESULTS: ILTG was able to affect the melting curve significantly when using MSP-MCA. ILTG exhibited a demethylating activity on HT-29 colon cancer and HL-60 leukemia cells. CONCLUSION: ILTG found in licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra) may have the potential for being a cancer chemopreventive agent. From the specific assays performed in this experiment, ILTG appears to possess potential for development as a demethylating agent for either colon cancer or leukemia cancer prevention.",cancer
"A comparison of outcome in patients with stage 1 clear cell and grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium with and without adjuvant therapy. OBJECTIVE: To determine the outcomes in patients with Stage I uterine clear cell carcinoma (UCCC) treated with and without adjuvant therapy, and to compare the outcomes in these patients to that of matched controls, patients with Stage I, grade 3, endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium (EC). METHODS: Patients with FIGO Stage I UCCC who underwent comprehensive surgical staging between January 1996 and January 2007 were identified. Cases (UCCC) were matched by age, stage, adjuvant therapy, and year of diagnosis to controls consisting of patients with grade 3 EC. Recurrence and survival were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: 25 patients with Stage I UCCC were identified of whom 13 (52%) received no adjuvant therapy and 12 (48%) received adjuvant radiation therapy (XRT). The 5-year disease-free survival and overall survival rates for the observation and the XRT groups were 78% and 75%, (p = 0.7) and 85% and 82% (p = 0.1), respectively. When compared to controls, the 5-year disease-free survival rates and overall survival rates of patients with Stage I UCCC were not significantly different, 77% vs 75% (p = 0.8) and 84% vs 88% (p = 0.5), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with Stage I UCCC tumors there was no clear benefit to adjuvant radiation given the absence of improvement in recurrence risk or any survival benefit. These data question the benefit of radiation therapy in UCCC patients with disease confined to the uterus.",cancer
"Pelvic tuberculosis mimicking ovarian malignancy: a case report. BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis is quite prevalent in developing countries, including India. In the female genital tract, the fallopian tube is the most common site involved by the disease. CASE: A woman presented with infertility, menstrual irregularities, an abdominal mass, abdominal pain and weight loss. She was previously operated on for left ovarian germ cell tumor. The clinical, radiologic and histopathologic examination helped to reach the correct diagnosis. CONCLUSION: In a woman with a history of infertility, menstrual irregularities, an abdominal mass and weight loss, differentiation between malignancy and tuberculosis becomes difficult. These two possibilities should always be part of the differential diagnosis.",cancer
"Classic hybrid evolving approach to distal arch aneurysms: toward the zone zero solution. BACKGROUND: A combined open surgical and endovascular approach to managing aneurysms of the distal aortic arch (hybrid arch repair) is evolving as a viable treatment option. Our aim is to describe a treatment strategy in high-risk patients and report the technical and clinical success of the hybrid approach to aneurysms involving the distal aortic arch. METHODS: From July 2005 until December 2009, 27 consecutive patients with aneurysms of the distal aortic arch were treated via a hybrid arch repair. Of this group, 23 patients underwent aortic arch debranching and revascularization before endovascular stent deployment in the ascending aorta (type I). Four patients required ascending aortic and transverse arch replacement before stent graft deployment (type II). RESULTS: A stent graft was successfully deployed in 100% of patients after aortic arch vessel debranching via median sternotomy. The mean age of the patients was 71 +/- 7.5 years. The average cardiopulmonary bypass time was 199 +/- 84 minutes with an average crossclamp time of 57 +/- 53 minutes. Deep hypothermic circulatory arrest was required in 4 patients (all type II). The average length of stay was 17.2 +/- 14 days. The complications included stroke in 3 (11%) patients, permanent paralysis in 2 (7%), and perioperative death in 3 (11%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Early results of type I and II hybrid arch repair, in this cohort of patients with mutiple comorbid risk factors, are acceptable and even encouraging. This evolving approach to aneurysms involving the aortic arch may extend the indications for use of endovascular prostheses in the treatment of patients with complex aortic arch disease.",nocancer

"Immunogenicity of a monovalent pandemic influenza A H1N1 vaccine in health-care workers of a university hospital in Japan. A phase III observational study evaluating a single-dose of an inactivated, split-virus, unadjuvanted AH1pdm vaccine in HCW was conducted. A safe and effective vaccine was needed after the emergence of AH1pdm in April 2009. We analyzed the immunogenicity and safety of the vaccine. A total of 409 subjects were enrolled and given 15 mug hemagglutinin antigen by s.c. injection. Antibody titers were measured using hemagglutination-inhibition antibody assays before vaccination and 28 days after. The co-primary immunogenicity end-points were the proportion of subjects with antibody titers of 1:40 or more, the proportion of subjects with either seroconversion or a significant increase in antibody titer, and the factor increase in geometric mean titer. We collected 389 pair samples. Antibody titers of 1:40 or more were observed in 148 of 389 subjects (38.0%, 95% CI: 33.2-42.9). The immunogenicity was also confirmed in other end-points, but was not sufficient and was lower than in previous reports. A total of 96 of adverse events was reported: 51 local events and 57 systemic events. There were 12 subjects with both local and systemic events. Nearly all events were mild to moderate except in four subjects. A single 15-mug dose of AH1pdm vaccine did not induce sufficient immunogenicity in HCW, with mild-to-moderate vaccine-associated adverse events. We need to consider further improvement of the AH1pdm vaccine program in HCW for the prevention of nosocomial infection, as well as for the benefit of HCW.",nocancer
"Extranodal nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma with dissemination to the central nervous system: a case report. BACKGROUND: Lymphomas that infiltrate the nervous system in children correspond to those of precursor B cells, such as lymphoblastic and Burkitt's lymphoma. In adults, infiltration occurs in mature B-cell lymphomas, such as mantle cell lymphoma, and, rarely, in Hodgkin's lymphoma or peripheral NK/T-cell lymphomas. CASE: We report the case of a 48-year-old man, who two years before death was diagnosed with extranodal nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma nasal in the left nostril. He received radiotherapy and a year later presented tumor activity. He also presented infiltration to the bone marrow and underwent chemotherapy. Afterward, he presented paresthesia and paresis of the lower extremities, difficulty walking, loss of sphincter control, and seizures. Infiltration to the central nervous system was revealed by computed axial tomography, and cytologic study of cerebrospinal fluid revealed malignant lymphoid cells; he then received intrathecal chemotherapy. He died 3 months later. CONCLUSION: In Mexico, extranodal nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma occurs frequently. It is highly destructive and tightly related with the Epstein-Barr virus. Infiltration to the central nervous system is rare, and the neoplastic cells can be confused with other tumors, such as metastatic carcinomas.",cancer
"Costal osteochondroma causing pneumothorax in an adolescent: a case report and review of the literature. Costal osteochondroma is a rare but important condition to recognize because of the possibility of serious consequences if not diagnosed and treated promptly. Patients can present with numerous complications, including hemothorax, pneumothorax, nervous or vascular impingement, and fracture. We report the case of a 17-year-old adolescent boy who presented to the pediatrician with intermittent shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain. A chest x-ray demonstrated a left-sided pneumothorax and triangular opacity in the left chest. A computed tomographic scan of the chest revealed the cause to be a costal exostosis of the anterior fifth rib. The lesion was excised using video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, which has become an increasingly popular method for treating these lesions, causing significantly less morbidity and allowing for a faster recovery than a major thoracotomy.",cancer
"B55beta-associated PP2A complex controls PDK1-directed myc signaling and modulates rapamycin sensitivity in colorectal cancer. The PP2A serine/threonine protein phosphatase serves as a critical cellular regulator of cell growth, proliferation, and survival. However, how this pathway is altered in human cancer to confer growth advantage is largely unknown. Here, we show that PPP2R2B, encoding the B55beta regulatory subunit of the PP2A complex, is epigenetically inactivated by DNA hypermethylation in colorectal cancer. B55beta-associated PP2A interacts with PDK1 and modulates its activity toward Myc phosphorylation. On loss of PPP2R2B, mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin triggers a compensatory Myc phosphorylation in PDK1-dependent, but PI3K and AKT-independent manner, resulting in resistance. Reexpression of PPP2R2B, genetic ablation of PDK1 or pharmacologic inhibition of PDK1 abrogates the rapamycin-induced Myc phosphorylation, leading to rapamycin sensitization. Thus, PP2A-B55beta antagonizes PDK1-Myc signaling and modulates rapamycin sensitivity.",cancer
"Cytologic findings of metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma of the nasal cavity: a report of 2 cases. BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma metastasizing to the nasal cavity is rare, but nasal bleeding caused by it is difficult to treat. The reason is that a large majority of patients have a bleeding tendency due to liver cirrhosis. Accordingly, early and correct diagnosis is essential. CASES: Case 1, a Japanese man in therapy for C type liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, was diagnosed as metastasis to the bones, and then he was admitted. After hospitalization, he complained of nasal obstruction. Fine needle aspiration biopsy from a tumor occupying nasal and maxillary cavities showed overlapped cells and scattered cells having a round to oval nucleus containing one or a few large nucleoli. The characteristics of cells indicated metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma. In case 2, a Japanese man under treatment for liver cancer visited our hospital with a complaint of nasal obstruction. In fine needle aspiration biopsy from a mass in the right nasal cavity, cohesive clusters and sparse neoplastic cells similar to those observed in the first case were found. CONCLUSION: Aspiration cytology is useful in the diagnosis and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma metastatic to the nasal cavity. Finding characteristic cells is important in the diagnosis. Clinical information is sure to be a convincing clue.",cancer
"Nonpolio enterovirus and human parechovirus surveillance --- United States, 2006-2008. Enteroviruses, members of the Picornaviridae family, are common viruses associated with clinical manifestations ranging from mild respiratory symptoms to serious conditions, including aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, neonatal sepsis, and acute flaccid paralysis. Approximately 100 serotypes of nonpolio enteroviruses have been recognized, and some viruses previously classified as enteroviruses, namely echovirus 22 and 23, recently have been reclassified as human parechoviruses (HPeVs), a different genus within the Picornaviridae family. This report describes trends in nonpolio enterovirus and HPeV detections during 2006-2008, based on data from two laboratory-based surveillance systems, the National Enterovirus Surveillance System (NESS) and, for the first time, the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS). As in previous years, approximately 70% of detections occurred during July-October, the peak enterovirus season. The five most common enterovirus serotypes (coxsackievirus B1 [CVB1], echovirus 6, echovirus 9, echovirus 18, and coxsackievirus A9) accounted for 54% of total serotyped detections. During 2006-2008, southern states reported the most serotyped enterovirus detections, followed by midwestern states, western states, and the northeastern states. In 2007 and 2008, CVB1 was the predominant serotype detected, accounting for 24% and 19% of overall detections, respectively. In 2007, CVB1 was implicated in an outbreak of serious neonatal infections in the United States. Understanding trends in enterovirus and HPeV circulation can help clinicians decide when to test for these infections. Also, more timely reporting of data could help public health officials recognize outbreaks associated with these viruses.",nocancer
"Hemodialysis and the elderly patient: complications and concerns. The number of elderly people starting dialysis is continuously increasing. Despite the psychosocial conditions and limitations intrinsic to older age, the quality of life and survival in elderly patients on hemodialysis is frequently acceptable. A much grimmer picture of the life of elderly patients can be seen in patients with high comorbidity rates. In these patients, the early identification of the specific clinical problems that may cause many adverse effects for the dialysis treatment population becomes a relevant factor: e.g., cardiovascular diseases, malnutrition, inflammation, depression and cognitive disturbances. Many measures can be adopted to prevent serious complications in the elderly. Sodium, bicarbonate and potassium profiled dialysis can make the rapid corrections induced by dialysis less devastating, compared with constant ionic concentrations and constant bicarbonate content in the dialysate. The approach to the removal of excess fluid should be similar: the avoidance of large ultrafiltrations and, above all, rapid ultrafiltration rates. It is better to turn to ultrafiltration profiles, controlled blood volume dialysis and possible long-duration dialysis, preferably nocturnal or daily dialyses.",nocancer
"The skin cancer prevention framework: a comprehensive tool for population-level efforts in skin cancer. The Skin Cancer Prevention Team (SCPT) required a comprehensive approach for guiding its efforts in population-level skin cancer prevention. After identifying and reviewing several models, it concluded that an appropriate population-level model applicable to the Alberta context did not exist. Thus, the SCPT, under the Alberta Health Services - Cancer Prevention Program, developed and evaluated a model for Alberta. Three inclusion criteria for a comprehensive framework were identified: 1) use an ecological approach to population health; 2) function as a dynamic tool for planning, implementing and evaluating population-level efforts; and 3) address weaknesses in existing theory in population health and health promotion. Theoretical constructs were layered together, on the basis of the criteria, to develop an omnibus framework. The resulting Framework represents a layering of several constructs used in popular health promotion and population health theories. It merges principles of the realist approach to scientific enquiry with principles of ecological theory. The Framework outlines a three-step, dynamic process for planning, implementing and evaluating population-level efforts. It also provides insight into the larger, unifying influences for changes in health outcomes and the complex mechanisms of behaviour change processes at the population level.",cancer

"Association of reversed Robin Hood syndrome with risk of stroke recurrence. BACKGROUND: Reversed Robin Hood syndrome (RRHS) has recently been identified as one of the mechanisms of early neurologic deterioration in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients related to arterial blood flow steal from ischemic to nonaffected brain. We sought to investigate the association of RRHS with risk of stroke recurrence in a single-center cohort study. METHODS: Consecutive patients with AIS or TIA affecting the anterior circulation were prospectively evaluated with serial NIH Stroke Scale assessments and bilateral transcranial Doppler monitoring with breath-holding test. RRHS was defined according to previously validated criteria. RESULTS: A total of 360 patients (51% women, mean age 62 +/- 15 years) had an ischemic stroke (81%) or TIA (19%) in the anterior circulation, and 30 (8%) of them had RRHS. During a mean follow-up period of 6 months (range 1-24), a total of 16 (4%) recurrent strokes (15 ischemic and 1 hemorrhagic) were documented. The cumulative recurrence rate was higher in patients with RRHS (19%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1-37) compared to the rest (15%; 95% CI 0-30; p = 0.022 by log-rank test). All recurrent strokes in patients with RRHS were cerebral infarcts that occurred in the ipsilateral to the index event anterior circulation vascular territory. After adjusting for demographic characteristics, vascular risk factors, and secondary prevention therapies, RRHS was independently associated with a higher stroke recurrence risk (hazard ratio 7.31; 95% CI 2.12-25.22; p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AIS and RRHS appear to have a higher risk of recurrent strokes that are of ischemic origin and occur in the same arterial territory distribution to the index event. Further independent validation of this association is required in a multicenter setting.",nocancer

"Brain metastasis in melanoma: clinical activity of CTLA-4 antibody therapy. Melanoma metastasizes frequently to the brain, and brain metastases generally drive the prognosis of melanoma patients. Surgical and radiation therapy improve the outcome of selected melanoma patients with brain metastasis, while systemic treatment using cytotoxic agents still plays a limited role. Temozolomide and fotemustine are preferentially used in melanoma patients with brain metastases in the United States and in Europe, respectively, with modest clinical activity. However, the results obtained with either agent are still limited, and efforts are needed to improve the outcome of these patients who are generally excluded from clinical trials. Among therapeutic agents in development, antibodies that block the interaction of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen (CTLA-4) with its ligands B7.1 and B7.2 and thus enhance antitumor immune responses have shown clinical benefit in patients with metastatic melanoma, including durable control of brain metastases.

Understanding the pharmacokinetics of the new AEDs is important because they are primarily used for adjunctive therapy and interactions with other medications can result in significant toxicities. The new-generation AEDs do not cause serious morbidity in overdose, and treatment is primarily supportive. Specific medications should be chosen based on the patient's history and presentation.",nocancer
"Comparison of BD Surepath and ThinPrep Pap systems in the processing of mucus-rich specimens. BACKGROUND: Excessive mucus, as well as blood and inflammation, can be problematic in the processing and screening of liquid-based cervical Pap preparations by interfering in the process of cell retrieval onto specimen filters or slides. This study compares the capacity of the BD SurePath and ThinPrep liquid-based Papanicolaou (Pap) tests to handle mucus-laden specimens. METHODS: A 100 muL volume of pooled cervical epithelial cells was added to BD SurePath and ThinPrep liquid Pap test vials. Aliquots of cervical mucus that had been collected and pooled from previously processed mucus-rich Pap specimens were added to each series of test vials in amounts of 250 muL, 500 muL, 1000 muL, and 2000 muL. The vials were then routinely processed on their respective instruments and the test slides evaluated for cellularity of the squamous cell component. RESULTS: The BD SurePath test specimens showed no reduction of the squamous cell component resulting from the addition of any of the aliquots of mucus. The ThinPrep test specimens showed a marked loss of cellularity upon the addition of the first aliquot of mucus, with large areas of the filters showing nearly complete absence of squamous cells. CONCLUSIONS: Excessive mucus remains a potentially limiting factor in the ThinPrep Pap system. This appears to be the result of direct obstruction of the filtration membrane causing a markedly diminished retrieval of squamous epithelial cells and potentially impacting disease detection. The BD SurePath system, conversely, manages mucus by a cell enrichment process, which results in undiminished cell recovery as observed in this study's test conditions.",cancer
"What happens to femoral neck bone mineral density after hip resurfacing surgery? The major advantage of hip resurfacing is the decreased amount of bone resection compared with a standard total hip replacement. Fracture of the femoral neck is the most common early complication and poor bone quality is a major risk factor. We undertook a prospective consecutive case control study examining the effect of bone mineral density changes in patients undergoing hip resurfacing surgery. A total of 423 patients were recruited with a mean age of 54 years (24 to 87). Recruitment for this study was dependent on pre-operative bilateral femoral bone mineral density results not being osteoporotic. The operated and non-operated hips were assessed. Bone mineral density studies were repeated over a two-year period. The results showed no significant deterioration in the bone mineral density in the superolateral region in the femoral neck, during that period. These findings were in the presence of a markedly increased level of physical activity, as measured by the short-form 36 health survey physical function score.",nocancer
"Enrollment trends in deaf education teacher preparation programs, 1973-2009. The number of deaf education teacher preparation programs and the number of program graduates were tabulated from reference issues of the American Annals of the Deaf beginning in 1973 and progressing every third year through 2009. Programs and graduates reached their highest levels from the mid-1970s through mid-1980s. In 2006 and 2009, only about one fourth as many students were majoring in deaf education in relation to the general U.S. college population as in 1973, 1976, and 1979. Yet because the population of children identified as deaf and hard of hearing has also declined, the ratio of program graduates to deaf children has stayed relatively balanced for the past 20 years. Current challenges faced by teacher preparation programs include increases in interpreter preparation programs and programs for teaching American Sign Language, as well as the changing nature of the role of teacher of the deaf.",nocancer
"Trends in dental caries prevalence, severity and unmet treatment need levels in South Africa between 1983 and 2002. OBJECTIVES: To determine trends in dental caries prevalence, severity and unmet treatment need levels amongst South African children. METHODOLOGY: Data obtained from three National Oral Health surveys (1982, 1988/89, 1999/2002) was used. RESULTS: Prevalence of caries amongst 12-year-old children decreased from 64.4% (1982) through 54.9% (1988/89) to 41.7% (1999/2002) and the DMFT decreased significantly (p < 0.05) from 2.54 (1982) through 1.73 (1988/89) to 1.17 (1999/2002). Unmet treatment need increased from 70.5% (1982), 72.3% (1988/89) to 75.2% (1999/2002). Significant decreases (p < 0.05) were recorded in the DMFT (1982-2002) in White, 75.3%; Asian, 64.1%; Black, 49.8%; and Coloured groups, 44.8%. High levels of untreated caries (D) and very low levels of treatment (M and F) were also observed. The highest mean dmft/DMFT for 6- and 12-year-olds respectively were recorded in the coastal areas of Metro Cape (5.1/1.86); followed by Port Elizabeth (3.86/1.37) and Durban (3.42/1.33); and the lowest in the interior--Bloemfontein (2.47/0.73). CONCLUSIONS: Caries reduced significantly during the past 20 years; is more prevalent and severe amongst Coloured and Black population groups and in coastal regions compared to the interior region. Unmet treatment need in 12- and 15-year-old children increased and more than 70% of caries in 6-, 12- and 15-year-old children go untreated.",nocancer
"Survival of MUTYH-associated polyposis patients with colorectal cancer and matched control colorectal cancer patients. BACKGROUND: MUTYH-associated polyposis is a recessively inherited disorder characterized by a lifetime risk of colorectal cancer that is up to 100%. Because specific histological and molecular genetic features of MUTYH-associated polyposis colorectal cancers might influence tumor behavior and patient survival, we compared survival between patients with MUTYH-associated polyposis colorectal cancer and matched control patients with colorectal cancer from the general population. METHODS: In this retrospective multicenter cohort study from Europe, 147 patients with MUTYH-associated polyposis colorectal cancer were compared with 272 population-based control patients with colorectal cancer who were matched for country, age at diagnosis, year of diagnosis, stage, and subsite of colorectal cancer. Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox regression analyses were used to compare survival between patients with MUTYH-associated polyposis colorectal cancer and control patients with colorectal cancer. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Five-year survival for patients with MUTYH-associated polyposis colorectal cancer was 78% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 70% to 84%) and for control patients was 63% (95% CI = 56% to 69%) (log-rank test, P = .002). After adjustment for differences in age, stage, sex, subsite, country, and year of diagnosis, survival remained better for MUTYH-associated polyposis colorectal cancer patients than for control patients (hazard ratio of death = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.32 to 0.72). CONCLUSIONS: In a European study cohort, we found statistically significantly better survival for patients with MUTYH-associated polyposis colorectal cancer than for matched control patients with colorectal cancer.",cancer
"Hearing loss and complaint in patients with head and neck cancer treated with radiotherapy. OBJECTIVE: To investigate occurrences of hearing loss and hearing complaints among patients with head and neck tumors who underwent radiotherapy. DESIGN: Prospective case-control study. SETTING: Tertiary care hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred eighty-two participants underwent evaluation, including 141 with head and neck tumors and 141 as an age-matched control group. The controls had never undergone oncological treatment that put their hearing at risk. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Results of audiological evaluation, including the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly questionnaire and pure-tone, speech, and immittance audiometry, and radiation dose received by the auditory system (based on the percentage of the external auditory canal included in the radiation field). RESULTS: We observed occurrences of hearing loss in 102 (72.3%) of the participants exposed to radiotherapy and 69 (48.9%) of the control group (P < .001). Hearing losses were mostly sensorineural and of mild degree, but those exposed to radiotherapy more frequently presented with severe and mixed-type hearing losses (P < .001). Of the participants exposed to radiotherapy, 19.1% had a severe handicap (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing radiotherapy in the head and neck region have a higher incidence of hearing loss and more severe hearing handicap.

"Cascaded analysis of signal and noise propagation through a heterogeneous breast model. PURPOSE: The detectability of lesions in radiographic images can be impaired by patterns caused by the surrounding anatomic structures. The presence of such patterns is often referred to as anatomic noise. Others have previously extended signal and noise propagation theory to include variable background structure as an additional noise term and used in simulations for analysis by human and ideal observers. Here, the analytic forms of the signal and noise transfer are derived to obtain an exact expression for any input random distribution and the ""power law"" filter used to generate the texture of the tissue distribution. METHODS: A cascaded analysis of propagation through a heterogeneous model is derived for x-ray projection through simulated heterogeneous backgrounds. This is achieved by considering transmission through the breast as a correlated amplification point process. The analytic forms of the cascaded analysis were compared to monoenergetic Monte Carlo simulations of x-ray propagation through power law structured backgrounds. RESULTS: As expected, it was found that although the quantum noise power component scales linearly with the x-ray signal, the anatomic noise will scale with the square of the x-ray signal. There was a good agreement between results obtained using analytic expressions for the noise power and those from Monte Carlo simulations for different background textures, random input functions, and x-ray fluence. CONCLUSIONS: Analytic equations for the signal and noise properties of heterogeneous backgrounds were derived. These may be used in direct analysis or as a tool to validate simulations in evaluating detectability.",cancer
"Reduced mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplantation. BACKGROUND: Over the past decade, advances have been made in the care of patients undergoing transplantation. We conducted a study to determine whether these advances have improved the outcomes of transplantation. METHODS: We analyzed overall mortality, mortality not preceded by relapse, recurrent malignant conditions, and the frequency and severity of major complications of transplantation, including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and hepatic, renal, pulmonary, and infectious complications, among 1418 patients who received their first allogeneic transplants at our center in Seattle in the period from 1993 through 1997 and among 1148 patients who received their first allogeneic transplants in the period from 2003 through 2007. Components of the Pretransplant Assessment of Mortality (PAM) score were used in regression models to adjust for the severity of illness at the time of transplantation. RESULTS: In the 2003-2007 period, as compared with the 1993-1997 period, we observed significant decreases in mortality not preceded by relapse, both at day 200 (by 60%) and overall (by 52%), the rate of relapse or progression of a malignant condition (by 21%), and overall mortality (by 41%), after adjustment for components of the PAM score. The results were similar when the analyses were limited to patients who received myeloablative conditioning therapy. We also found significant decreases in the risk of severe GVHD; disease caused by viral, bacterial, and fungal infections; and damage to the liver, kidneys, and lungs. CONCLUSIONS: We found a substantial reduction in the hazard of death related to allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplantation, as well as increased long-term survival, over the past decade. Improved outcomes appear to be related to reductions in organ damage, infection, and severe acute GVHD. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health.).",cancer
"Older donors and older recipients in kidney transplantation. Over the last 2 decades, while kidney transplantation became the therapy of choice for end-stage renal disease, the increasing gap between the limited supply of cadaveric donors and the rising demand for kidneys led to the consideration of alternative strategies to provide more organs for transplant. The significant increase of mean donor age suggested the use of kidneys from older donors. In addition, an increasing number of donors with significant comorbidities (e.g., hypertension and diabetes) or deceased due to stroke have been used since the early 1990s, leading to the definition of the fuzzy and disputed concept of ""marginal"" donors. Such organs are eligible for organ donation but, because of extreme age and other clinical characteristics, are expected to produce allografts at risk for diminished posttransplant function. Thus, the challenge is now to improve the graft outcome gap between patients receiving grafts from ""marginal"" and ""optimal"" donors. This implies appropriate transplantation strategies during all transplant phases, including reduction of cold ischemia time, recipient selection, adaptation of immunosuppressive drug regimens, increase in nephron mass by dual kidney transplantation and improvement in the graft selection process using histological criteria. This review summarizes the current definition of a marginal donor and provides some suggestions for clinical management of these particular kidney transplants. We believe that in this particular transplanted population, an effective balance should be ensured between maintaining graft survival, reducing the impact of immunosuppressive toxicity and maximizing patient quality of life through the reduced incidence of cardiovascular disease and malignancies.",nocancer
"Signaling through OX40 enhances antitumor immunity. The existence of tumor-specific T cells, as well as their ability to be primed in cancer patients, confirms that the immune response can be deployed to combat cancer. However, there are obstacles that must be overcome to convert the ineffective immune response commonly found in the tumor environment to one that leads to sustained destruction of tumor. Members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily direct diverse immune functions. OX40 and its ligand, OX40L, are key TNF members that augment T-cell expansion, cytokine production, and survival. OX40 signaling also controls regulatory T-cell differentiation and suppressive function. Studies over the past decade have demonstrated that OX40 agonists enhance antitumor immunity in preclinical models using immunogenic tumors; however, treatment of poorly immunogenic tumors has been less successful. Combining strategies that prime tumor-specific T cells together with OX40 signaling could generate and maintain a therapeutic antitumor immune response.",cancer
"Pathologic complete response of primary tumor following preoperative chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer: long-term outcomes and prognostic significance of pathologic nodal status (KROG 09-01). OBJECTIVE: To investigate long-term outcomes of locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) patients with postchemoradiotherapy (post-CRT) pathologic complete response of primary tumor (ypT0) and determine prognostic significance of post-CRT pathologic nodal (ypN) status. BACKGROUND: LARC patients with post-CRT pathologic complete response were suggested to have favorable long-term outcomes, but prognostic significance of ypN status has never been specifically defined in ypT0 patients. METHODS: The Korean Radiation Oncology Group collected clinical data for 333 LARC patients with ypT0 following preoperative CRT and curative radical resections between 1993 and 2007. Sphincter preservation surgery and abdominoperineal resection were performed in 283 (85.0%) and 50 (15.0%) patients, respectively. Postoperative chemotherapy was given to 285 (85.6%) patients. Survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the Cox proportional hazard model was used in multivariate analyses. RESULTS: After median follow-up of 43 (range = 14-172) months, 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 84.6% and overall survival (OS) was 92.8%. The ypN status was ypT0N0 in 304 (91.3%), ypT0N1 in 22 (6.6%), and ypT0N2 in 7 (2.1%) patients. The ypN status was the most relevant independent prognostic factor for both DFS and OS in ypT0 patients. The 5-year DFS and OS was 88.5% and 94.8% in ypT0N0 patients, and 45.2% and 72.8% in ypT0N+ patients (both, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: LARC patients achieving ypT0N0 after preoperative CRT had favorable long-term outcomes, whereas positive ypN status had a poor prognosis even after total regression of primary tumor.",cancer
"Sororin mediates sister chromatid cohesion by antagonizing Wapl. Sister chromatid cohesion is essential for chromosome segregation and is mediated by cohesin bound to DNA. Cohesin-DNA interactions can be reversed by the cohesion-associated protein Wapl, whereas a stably DNA-bound form of cohesin is thought to mediate cohesion. In vertebrates, Sororin is essential for cohesion and stable cohesin-DNA interactions, but how Sororin performs these functions is unknown. We show that DNA replication and cohesin acetylation promote binding of Sororin to cohesin, and that Sororin displaces Wapl from its binding partner Pds5. In the absence of Wapl, Sororin becomes dispensable for cohesion. We propose that Sororin maintains cohesion by inhibiting Wapl's ability to dissociate cohesin from DNA. Sororin has only been identified in vertebrates, but we show that many invertebrate species contain Sororin-related proteins, and that one of these, Dalmatian, is essential for cohesion in Drosophila. The mechanism we describe here may therefore be widely conserved among different species.",nocancer

"Thirty new loci for age at menarche identified by a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies. To identify loci for age at menarche, we performed a meta-analysis of 32 genome-wide association studies in 87,802 women of European descent, with replication in up to 14,731 women. In addition to the known loci at LIN28B (P = 5.4 x 10(-)(6)(0)) and 9q31.2 (P = 2.2 x 10(-)(3)(3)), we identified 30 new menarche loci (all P < 5 x 10(-)(8)) and found suggestive evidence for a further 10 loci (P < 1.9 x 10(-)(6)). The new loci included four previously associated with body mass index (in or near FTO, SEC16B, TRA2B and TMEM18), three in or near other genes implicated in energy homeostasis (BSX, CRTC1 and MCHR2) and three in or near genes implicated in hormonal regulation (INHBA, PCSK2 and RXRG).

"A phase I dose-escalation study to evaluate safety and tolerability of sorafenib combined with sirolimus in patients with advanced solid cancer. BACKGROUND: The combination of sorafenib (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 inhibitor) and sirolimus (mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor) might work synergistically. METHODS: A phase I dose-escalation study with sorafenib twice a day (b.i.d.) and sirolimus once daily (q.d.) was performed to determine the recommended dose of the combination in patients with solid tumours. Secondary objectives were to determine the safety profile and maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the combination. RESULTS: Dose-limiting toxicities were transaminitis and cutaneous toxicity. The most frequently reported adverse events were elevated transaminases, hypophosphatemia, fatigue, anorexia, diarrhoea, nausea, rash and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia. Sirolimus did not change the PK of sorafenib; in contrast, sorafenib reduced the AUC(0-96) and C(max) of sirolimus. No objective responses were observed; eight patients showed stable disease for a median of 16.3 weeks (range 8-24). The MTD of the combination was sorafenib 200 mg b.i.d. with sirolimus 1 mg q.d. CONCLUSION: The combination of sorafenib and sirolimus showed enhanced toxicity, which could not be explained by the PK of both drugs. The relative low doses at the MTD, in combination with the PK results, do not warrant further development of this combination.",cancer
"Rectal cancer surgery with or without bowel preparation: The French GRECCAR III multicenter single-blinded randomized trial. OBJECTIVE: To assess with a single-blinded, multicenter, randomized trial, the postoperative results in patients undergoing sphincter-saving rectal resection for cancer without preoperative mechanical bowel preparation (MBP). BACKGROUND: The collective evidence from literature strongly suggests that MBP, before elective colonic surgery, is of no benefit in terms of postoperative morbidity. Very few data and no randomized study are available for rectal surgery and preliminary results conclude toward the safety of rectal resection without MBP. METHODS: From October 2007 to January 2009, patients scheduled for elective rectal cancer sphincter-saving resection were randomized to receive preoperative MBP (ie, retrograde enema and oral laxatives) or not. Primary endpoint was the overall 30-day morbidity rate. Secondary endpoints included mortality rate, anastomotic leakage rate, major morbidity rate (Dindo III or more), degree of discomfort for the patient, and hospital stay. RESULTS: A total of 178 patients (103 men), including 89 in both groups (no-MBP and MBP groups), were included in the study. The overall and infectious morbidity rates were significantly higher in no-MBP versus MBP group, 44% versus 27%, P = 0.018, and 34% versus 16%, P = 0.005, respectively. Regarding both anastomotic leakage and major morbidity rates, there was no significant difference between no-MBP and MBP group: 19% versus 10% (P = 0.09) and 18% versus 11% (P = 0.69), respectively. Moderate or severe discomfort was reported by 40% of prepared patients. Mortality rate (1.1% vs 3.4%) and mean hospital stay (16 vs 14 days) did not differ significantly between both groups. CONCLUSIONS: This first randomized trial demonstrated that rectal cancer surgery without MBP was associated with higher risk of overall and infectious morbidity rates without any significant increase of anastomotic leakage rate. Thus, it suggests continuing to perform MBP before elective rectal resection for cancer.",cancer
"Diagnosis of adult rhabdomyoma by fine needle aspiration cytology: a report of 2 cases. BACKGROUND: Adult rhabdomyoma (ARh) is a rare, benign tumor originating in striated muscle cells. Ninety-three percent of the tumors occur in the head and neck region and sometimes mimic malignant tumors clinically. The preoperative correct diagnosis of this tumor is important as it can help in deciding on management. CASES: We report two cases of ARh diagnosed by fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). Case 1 was a 43-year-old male who presented with a recurrent tumor in the region of the floor of the mouth. Case 2 was a 37-year-old male who presented with soft tissue swellings in bilateral submandibular regions. On cytology in both cases, the smears showed numerous large tissue fragments of tumor cells, which were large, polygonal cells with abundant, vacuolated cytoplasm and bland, eccentrically placed nuclei. Characteristic cross-striation and intracytoplasmic inclusions were not conspicuous on cytosmears. However, a primary cytodiagnosis of ARh could be offered based on characteristic morphologic features. CONCLUSION: ARh has characteristic cytomorphologic features, which are described in detail in the present report, and they can help in diagnosing this tumor on FNAC.",cancer
"The contribution of Langerhans cells to cutaneous malignancy. The skin is at the forefront of environmental exposures, such as ultraviolet radiation and a myriad of chemicals, and is at risk for malignant transformation. The skin is a highly responsive immunological organ that contains a unique population of immature intraepidermal dendritic cells (DCs) called Langerhans cells (LCs). Although LCs show morphological and migratory changes in response to epidermal perturbation, and can function as antigen-presenting cells to activate T cells, their role in carcinogenesis is unknown. Here we review recent studies that have provided clues to the potential roles that LCs might play in the pathogenesis of skin cancer, beyond their stimulation or regulation of adaptive immunity. Understanding this role of LCs might provide new perspectives on the relevance of DC populations that are resident within other epithelial tissues for cancer.",cancer

"Primary cilium-dependent and -independent Hedgehog signaling inhibits p16(INK4A). In a genome-wide siRNA analysis of p16(INK4a) (p16) modulators, we identify the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway component SUFU and formally demonstrate that Hh signaling promotes mitogenesis by suppression of p16. A fragment of the Hh-responsive GLI2 transcription factor directly binds and inhibits the p16 promoter and senescence is associated with the loss of nuclear GLI2. Hh components partially reside in the primary cilium (PC), and the small fraction of cells in mass culture that elaborate a PC have the lowest expression of p16. Suppression of p16 is effected by both PC-dependent and -independent routes, and ablation of p16 renders cells insensitive to an Hh inhibitor and increases PC formation. These results directly link a well-established developmental mitogenic pathway with a key tumor suppressor and contribute to the molecular understanding of replicative senescence, Hh-mediated oncogenesis, and potentially the role of p16 in aging.",nocancer
"Pheochromocytoma during pregnancy treated by surgery. A case report and the review of the literature. INTRODUCTION: Prenatal diagnosis of pheocromocytoma, although rare, is important as it allows a reduction in both maternal mortality and foetal loss. Pheocromocytoma operated on in the first trimester of pregnancy with survival of both patient and foetus is rare in literature. Our case was operated on with success after a correct and early diagnosis was obtained despite a chronic hypertension which existed long before pregnancy. Our case study well illustrates that a correct multidisciplinary approach involving endocrinologists, anesthesiologists, surgeons and gynecologists is fundamental for a positive outcome. CASE REPORT: The case of a white caucasian pregnant woman at 13th weeks of gestation with pheocromocytoma and severe and unstable hypertension that could not be pharmacologically controlled is described. Morphological diagnosis was safely obtained by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) without intravenous medium contrast agent. Pre-operative treatment consisted of therapy with alpha-blockers and rehydration. Adrenalectomy was performed through a laparotomy. Postoperative treatment consisted of rehydration and ephedrine continued until the fourth post-operative day. The post-operative period was uneventful and a new ultrasound (US) scan confirmed foetal vitality. The patient was discharged seven days after surgery. A live newborn was physiologically delivered after a nine-month pregnancy. CONCLUSION: A correct diagnosis in all pregnant women with severe hypertension particularly those not screened for secondary hypertension and a multidisciplinary management are mandatory to obtain optimal results and avoid deleterious effects at delivery.",cancer
"Expressions and clinical significances of CD133 protein and CD133 mRNA in primary lesion of gastric adenocacinoma. BACKGROUND: To study on expressions and clinical significances of CD133 protein and CD133 mRNA in primary lesion of gastric adenocarcinoma (GC). METHODS: Expressions of CD133 protein by immunostaining (99 cases) and CD133 mRNA by semi-quantitative RT-PCR (31 cases) were detected in primary lesion and in noncancerous gastric mucosa tissue (NCGT). Correlations of CD133 protein expression with clinicopathological parameters and post-operative survival were analyzed. Relations of CD133 mRNA level with Ki-67 labeling index (LI), and lymphatic metastasis were assessed too. RESULTS: Brown particles indicating CD133 protein positivity occurred in some parts of tumor cells and epithelium. Expressive percentage of CD133 protein positivity was significantly higher in subgroups with >5 cm diameter (P = 0.041), later TNM stage (P = 0.044), severer lymph node metastasis (P = 0.017), occurrences of lymphatic invasion (P = 0.000) and vascular invasion (P = 0.000) respectively. Severer invasion depth (P = 0.011), lymph node metastasis occurrence (P = 0.043) and later TNM stage (P = 0.049) were the independent risk factors for CD133 protein expression. Average brightness scale value (BSV) of CD133 mRNA was significantly higher in subgroups with >5 cm diameter (P = 0.041), lymph node metastasis occurrence (P = 0.004) and in lower Ki-67 LI (P = 0.02). Relative analysis revealed that BSV of CD133 mRNA related positively to metastatic lymphatic nodes ratio (P = 0.008) and metastatic lymph node number (P = 0.009), but negatively to Ki-67 LI (P = 0.009). Survival of positive subgroup of CD 133 protein was significantly poorer (P = 0.047). Lymph node metastasis occurrence (P = 0.042), later TNM stage (P = 0.046) and CD 133 protein positive expression (P = 0.046) were respectively the independent risk factors to survival. CONCLUSION: Higher expressive level of CD133 mRNA is associated to lower Ki-67 LI and severer lymphatic metastasis. Therefore, the expressive level of CD133 mRNA can play an appropriate role to reflect the status of lymph node metastasis and proliferation of GC. CD133 protein expression is closely related with larger tumor, later TNM stage, lymphtic metastasis and survival of GC.",cancer
"Fraction size in radiation treatment for breast conservation in early breast cancer. BACKGROUND: Shortening the duration of radiation therapy would benefit women with early breast cancer treated with breast conserving surgery. It may also improve access to radiation therapy by improving efficiency in radiation oncology departments globally. This can only happen if the shorter treatment is as effective and safe as conventional radiation therapy. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in Issue 3, 2008. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of altered radiation fraction size on outcomes for women with early breast cancer who have undergone breast conserving surgery. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the WHO ICTRP search portal to June 2009, reference lists of articles and relevant conference proceedings. We applied no language constraints. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of unconventional versus conventional fractionation in women with early breast cancer who had undergone breast conserving surgery. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The authors performed data extraction independently, with disagreements resolved by discussion. We sought missing data from trial authors. MAIN RESULTS: Four trials reported on 7095 women. The women were highly selected: tumours were node negative and 89.8% were smaller than 3 cm. Where the breast size was known, 87% had small or medium breasts. The studies were of low to medium quality. Unconventional fractionation (delivering radiation therapy in larger amounts each day but over fewer days than with conventional fractionation) did not affect: (1) local recurrence risk ratio (RR) 0.97 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.22, P = 0.78), (2) breast appearance RR 1.17 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.39, P = 0.09), (3) survival at five years RR 0.89 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.04, P = 0.16). Acute skin toxicity was decreased with unconventional fractionation: RR 0.21 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.64, P = 0.007). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Two new studies have been published since the last version of the review, altering our conclusions. We have evidence from four low to medium quality randomised trials that using unconventional fractionation regimens (greater than 2 Gy per fraction) does not affect local recurrence, is associated with decreased acute toxicity and does not seem to affect breast appearance or late toxicity for selected women treated with breast conserving therapy. These are mostly women with node negative tumours smaller than 3 cm and negative pathological margins. Long-term follow up (> 5 years) is available for a small proportion of the patients randomised. Longer follow up is required for a more complete assessment of the effect of altered fractionation.",cancer
"The clinical reasoning process for the intervention of chronic plantar fasciitis. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Of the many foot and ankle conditions affecting older adults, plantar fasciitis (PF) can be especially debilitating when present for many months or years. Chronic PF is an inflammatory condition of the foot that can be detrimental to an individual's functional abilities. Chronic PF significantly impacts older adults since pain associated with PF can cause gait disturbances, difficulty with activities of daily living, and balance impairments and increase the risk of falling. This case report describes the physical therapy examination and subsequent interventions using iontophoresis with dexamethasone and traditional physical therapy in an older adult with chronic PF. CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient was a 61-year-old woman with a 10-year history of chronic PF in the left foot. Physical therapy interventions focused on pain control, flexibility, bilateral and single leg stance tasks, and a progressive home exercise program. The main intervention for pain control was iontophoresis with 4 mg/mL of dexamethasone. OUTCOMES: After 8 sessions of physical therapy that included 7 interventions using iontophoresis with dexamethasone, the patient demonstrated consistent improvement despite the chronicity of her condition. She reported an overall decrease in pain from 6-7 of 10 to 3 of 10 and no longer required night splints. She demonstrated increased ankle active range of motion in all planes. Her weight-bearing tolerance improved as evidenced by the ability to comfortably walk for up to 2 hours, chase after her grandson, and negotiate the grocery store without increased left foot symptoms. CONCLUSION: Iontophoresis with dexamethasone combined with individualized traditional physical therapy may have contributed to decreased plantar foot pain, increased ankle active range of motion, and improved functional mobility in this older adult with chronic PF.",nocancer
"Lipid-rich variant of pancreatic endocrine neoplasms: a case report. BACKGROUND: Pancreatic endocrine neoplasms (PENs) are a well-defined and well-characterized group of tumors. We report a rare variant of PENs called a lipid-rich variant and elaborate on its cytologic features with reference to fine needle aspiration (FNA). CASE: The patient was a 74-year-old man with a 2.1-cm mass in the body of the pancreas. The FNA showed numerous cells with vacuolated, foamy cytoplasm, mostly arranged individually but also in some apparently cohesive clusters. The nuclei were quite uniform. Many of the cells had the appearance of histiocytes. The cells in the cell block were immunoreactive (positive) for cytokeratin AE1/AE3, synaptophysin, and chromogranin A. Some admixed histiocytes stained for CD68. A diagnosis of PEN was made, with a suspicion for lipid-rich variant. An elective resection of the tumor was performed, which confirmed the diagnosis of lipid-rich variant of PENs. Lipid-rich variant of PENs can present a diagnostic dilemma on FNA. CONCLUSION: Its mimickers include adrenal cortical carcinoma, metastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma, clear-cell PEN, foamy gland pattern of pancreatic ductal carcinoma, solid pseudopapillary tumor, and acinar cell carcinoma. The distinguishing morphologic and immunohistochemical features of each are described.",cancer
"Brain neurotoxic amyloid-beta peptides: their potential role in the pathophysiology of depression and as molecular therapeutic targets. The monoamine hypothesis ascribes an important role to the under activity of brain monoamines such as 5-HT, noradrenaline and dopamine to the pathophysiology of depression. This view emerged more than 50 years ago and has guided development of most medications currently used for the treatment of this disorder. However, large numbers of depressed individuals treated with currently available antidepressant agents, or even with various combinations, do not respond. Residual symptoms, relapses and recurrences are common while receiving adequate doses of these medications. In a recent issue of the BJP, Colaianna et al.describe results suggesting that a new neurobiological mechanism with treatment implications should be considered for the development of depression in humans, namely, elevations in potentially neurotoxic brain amyloid-ss peptides.",nocancer
"Evaluation of in vitro biological activity of O-alkylated hydroxamic derivatives of some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. AIM: Several published studies suggest that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are promising anticancer agents. This study examined the in vitro effect of O-alkylated NSAID hydroxamic acid derivatives 3a-i on cell survival for a panel of human tumour cell lines, their cytotoxicity on normal human fibroblasts and their antiviral activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Established methods of cell viability testings, cell cycle analyses and Western blot assays were used. RESULTS: O-Alkylated NSAID hydroxamic acid derivatives exerted poor antiviral activity butreduced the viability of the studied tumour cell lines in a concentration-dependent manner showing low cytotoxic effect on normal fibroblasts. Compounds 3a and 3i were shown to be potent inhibitors of the growth of MIA PaCa-2 cell line. They induced p53-independent S-phase arrest and triggered caspase 3-dependent apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Two novel O-alkylated NSAID hydroxamic acid derivatives may be useful in the treatment of pancreatic cancer and should be further evaluated in vivo.",cancer

"Elastica staining for venous invasion results in superior prediction of cancer-specific survival in colorectal cancer. OBJECTIVE: To examine the prognostic implications of routine elastica staining for venous invasion on prediction of cancer-specific survival in colorectal cancer. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Venous invasion is an important high risk feature in colorectal cancer, although prevalence in published studies ranges from 10% to 90%. To resolve the disparity, elastica stains have been used in our institution to provide a more objective judgment since 2002. METHODS: The study included 419 patients undergoing curative elective colorectal cancer resection between 1997 and 2006. Patients were grouped prior to (1997-2001 [cohort 1]) and following the introduction of elastica staining (2003-2006 [cohort 2]). FINDINGS: Clinicopathologic characteristics and 3-year survival rates were similar in both groups. Rate of detected venous invasion increased from 18% to 58% following introduction of elastica staining (P < 0.001). The 3-year cancer-specific survival rate associated with the absence of venous invasion was 84% in cohort 1, compared with 96% in cohort 2 (P < 0.01). Elastica staining improved the prognostic value of venous invasion, showing the area under the receiver operator curve rising from 0.59 (P = 0.040; 1997-2001) to 0.68 (P < 0.001; 2003-2006), using cancer mortality as an end point. A direct comparison between H&E alone and elastica Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) was made in 53 patients. The area under the receiver operator curve increased from 0.58, P = 0.293 (H&E alone) to 0.74, P = 0.003 for venous invasion detected using the elastica method. CONCLUSIONS: Increased detection of venous invasion with elastica staining, compared with H&E staining, provides superior prediction of cancer survival in colorectal cancer. This relationship was seen in the comparison of 2 consecutive cohorts and in a direct comparison in a single cohort. Based on these results, elastica staining should be incorporated into the routine pathologic assessment of venous invasion in colorectal cancer.",cancer
"Vitamin K2: a novel therapy for osteoporosis. Development and maintenance of skeletal health is essential since the resultant effect of poor bone health is an increased risk of osteoporotic fracture. Osteoporosis is currently a major public health problem and with predicted demographic changes, its future health and economic impact is likely to be phenomenal. Adult bone health is predominantly governed by two factors: (i) Maximum attainment of peak bone mass; and (ii) rate of bone loss which occurs with ageing. Both aspects are determined by a combination of endogenous and exogenous factors and, although genetic influences are believed to account for up to three-quarters of the variation in bone mass, there is still room for the modifiable factors (including nutrition) to play an important role. This article covers clinical evidences of the positive effect of vitamin K2 on osteoporosis. The activity of vitamin K2 involves both an increase in the bone-building process and decrease in the bone-loss process. Article covers effect of vitamin K2 on bone homeostasis and its safety in children, hepatic and renal impairment. Vitamin K2 should be considered for prevention and treatment in those conditions known to contribute to osteoporosis.",nocancer

"Enigmatic lipoprotein (a) and cardiovascular disease. Lipoprotein (a), (LPA) consists of a low density lipoprotein (LDL)-like particle with a lipid core encircled by a large protein, the apo-B-100. A very large glycoprotein, the apoprotein (a) (apoA) is firmly linked to apo-B-100 by two covalent disulfide bonds. The metabolic role of LPA until very recently has been shrouded in mystery. Individuals who have no LPA or a very low level are not known to be affected with any specific disorder. Naturally, this does not mean that LPA above normal is likewise without clinical impact. Elevated LPA is a well known risk factor for atherosclerosis. Amount of LPA in the organism is genetically determined and it is also because of this that medical intervention has not been very successful in modifying this prominent risk metabolite (Fig. 3, Tab. 1, Ref. 37).",nocancer
Sequencing of DC-SIGN promoter indicates an association between promoter variation and risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in cantonese. BACKGROUND: The dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) is an important pathogen recognition receptor of the innate immune system. DC-SIGN promoter variants play important role in the susceptibility to various infectious diseases. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignancy that is common in southern China and whether DC-SIGN promoter variants have effects on susceptibility to NPC is still unknown. The aim of this study is to ascertain the potential involvement of DC-SIGN promoter single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NPC susceptibility. METHODS: We conducted a case control study based on Cantonese population including 444 NPC patients and 464 controls matched on age and sex. The 1041 bp of DC-SIGN promoter region was directly sequenced for all samples. Sequence alignment and SNP search were inspected using DNAStar analysis programs and haplotype frequencies were estimated in Haploview V 4.0. The associations between the SNPs and the risk of NPC were analyzed using chi-square test and non-conditional logistic regression analysis with SPSS 13.0 software. RESULTS: A total of six variants were observed in the DC-SIGN promoter region and DC-SIGN -139 GG and -939 AA were significantly associated with NPC risk with adjusted Odds Ratios (ORs) of 2.10 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.23-3.59; P = 0.006) and 2.52 (1.29-4.93; P = 0.007) respectively and subjects carrying the risk allele DC-SIGN -871 G had 1.47-fold (95% CI = 1.14-1.90) increased risks of developing NPC (P = 0.003). Haplotype analysis revealed that h1 'AAAG' was significantly associated with protection against NPC (OR = 0.69; P = 0.0002) and the association was still significant when using 1000 permutation test runs (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that DC-SIGN promoter variants appear to be involved in the susceptibility to NPC and the detailed mechanism of this effect need further studies.,cancer

"Multiple dens evaginatus of premolars and molars in Chinese dentition: a case report and literature review. Dens evaginatus (DE) is a dental anomaly that occurs as an accessory tubercle on the occlusal or lingual surface of a tooth. The authors provide a literature review and report a rare case in which DE occurs on multiple mandibular premolars and maxillary molars. The patient is a 26-year-old Chinese woman, with a chief complaint of gingival bleeding. DE affecting teeth 17, 27, 35, and 45 was found during clinical examination. For treatment of the patient, we reduced the opposing occluding teeth, while undertaking progressive grinding of the tubercles for six months. We followed-up for a year. This suggests the importance of examining for multiple DE during clinical practice.",nocancer
"Evidence and research perspectives for surgeons in the European Rectal Cancer Consensus Conference (EURECA-CC2). PURPOSE: Although surgery remains the most important treatment of rectal cancer, the management of this disease has evolved to become more multidisciplinary to offer the best clinical outcome. The International Conference on Multidisciplinary Rectal Cancer Treatment: Looking for an European Consensus' (EURECA-CC2) had the duty to identify the degree of consensus that could be achieved across a wide range of topics relating to the management of rectal cancer helping shape future programs, investigational protocols and guidelines for staging and treatment throughout Europe. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consensus was achieved using the Delphi method. Eight chapters were identified: epidemiology, diagnostics, pathology, surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, treatment toxicity and quality of life, follow-up, and research questions. Each chapter was subdivided by topic, and a series of statements were developed. Each committee member commented and voted, sentence by sentence three times. Sentences which did not reach agreement after voting round #2 were openly debated during the Conference in Perugia (Italy) December 2008. The Executive Committee scored percentage consensus based on three categories: ""large consensus"", ""moderate consensus"", ""minimum consensus"". RESULTS: The total number of the voted sentences was 207. Of the 207, 86% achieved large consensus, 13% achieved moderate consensus, and only 3 (1%) resulted in minimum consensus. No statement was disagreed by more than 50% of members. All chapters were voted on by at least 75% of the members, and the majority was voted on by 85%. CONCLUSIONS: This Consensus Conference represents an expertise opinion process that may help shape future programs, investigational protocols, and guidelines for staging and treatment of rectal cancer throughout Europe. In spite of substantial progress, many research challenges remain.",cancer
"Impact of tumor biology, particularly triple-negative status, on response to pre-operative sequential, dose-dense epirubicin, cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel in breast cancer. BACKGROUND: The central objective of this study was to determine the predictive impact of several established tumor biological factors (PgR, ER, HER2 and Ki-67) on response to pre-operative chemotherapy in primary breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 59 primary M0 breast cancer patients received pre-operative sequential dose-dense epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel (19 patients at dosage 100 mg/m(2), 40 patients at 75 mg/m(2)). RESULTS: Pathological complete remission (pCR) occurred in 17 patients (29%) and at least partial remission in 42 (71%). Higher proliferation (Ki-67) and lack of hormone receptors (either or both) were significant predictive factors for pCR; moreover, 8/11 (73%) patients with triple-negative tumors (HER2(-)/ER(-)/PgR(-)) had pCR (p=0.001). Breast conserving surgery was achieved in 46/59 patients (78%). Hand-foot syndrome occurred in 12/19 patients treated at the higher docetaxel dosage but only 1/40 of the remaining patients. Higher docetaxel dosage was associated with improved pCR in the non-triple-negative subgroup. CONCLUSION: The tumor biology of hormone receptor-negative, especially triple-negative, and highly proliferating breast cancer is associated with strongly positive response to dose-dense, pre-operative epirubicin/cyclophosphamide/docetaxel chemotherapy.",cancer

"Ovarian torsion; early diagnosis by MRI to prevent irreversible damage. BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of ovarian torsion can help prevent irreversible damage to the adnexal structures in women desiring to maintain fertility. CASE: The patient was transferred by ambulance for a six-hour history of severe lower abdominal pain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed bilateral enlarged ovaries measuring 5 x 6 cm (right) and 4 x 5 cm (left) with a right twisted and thickened peduncle. Ultrasonography failed to detect the peduncle changes. At surgery, the right adnexa was twisted 180 degrees in a clockwise direction with no findings suggestive of gangrenous change, hemorrhagic infarction or ischemic change. Detorsion of the twisted ovary was performed. CONCLUSION: Detection of tube torsion at MRI may be useful in the preoperative evaluation for surgical detorsion of twisted adnexa encountered in enlarged ovaries.",cancer
"Incidence of childhood central nervous system tumors in the Nordic countries. BACKGROUND: The incidence rates of childhood central nervous system (CNS) tumors in the Nordic countries remain among the highest in the world. Large geographical and temporal variations in the incidence rates of CNS tumors have been reported. Increasing incidence rates would be a public health concern, as they might indicate increased exposure to environmental risk factors. METHODS: All 3,983 children 0-14 years of age registered with a primary CNS tumor in 1985-2006 in the national cancer registries of the Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden were identified. Tumors were classified according to the International Classification of Childhood Cancer version 3 (ICCC-3). Join-point analysis was used to detect changes in trends and to estimate annual changes in incidence rates. RESULTS: The mean annual incidence rate of CNS tumors was 42 per million. No statistically significant change in time trends of incidence rates was observed during 1985-2006. Furthermore, the incidence by birth cohort was relatively stable during the study period. CONCLUSION: The incidence rates of childhood CNS tumors in the Nordic countries remain among the highest in the world. The stable incidence rates during the last 22 years indicate that major changes in environmental risk factors are unlikely.",cancer

"Implication of Kir4.1 channel in excess potassium clearance: an in vivo study on anesthetized glial-conditional Kir4.1 knock-out mice. The K(ir)4.1 channel is crucial for the maintenance of the resting membrane potential of glial cells, and it is believed to play a main role in the homeostasis of extracellular potassium. To understand its importance in these two phenomena, we have measured in vivo the variations of extracellular potassium concentration ([K(+)](o)) (with potassium-sensitive microelectrodes) and membrane potential of glial cells (with sharp electrodes) during stimulations in wild-type (WT) mice and glial-conditional knock-out (cKO) K(ir)4.1 mice. The conditional knockout was driven by the human glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter, gfa2. Experiments were performed in the hippocampus of anesthetized mice (postnatal days 17-24). Low level stimulation (<20 stimuli, 10 Hz) induced a moderated increase of [K(+)](o) (<2 mm increase) in both WT and cKO mice. However, cKO mice exhibited slower recovery of [K(+)](o) levels. With long-lasting stimulation (300 stimuli, 10 Hz), [K(+)](o) in WT and cKO mice displayed characteristic ceiling level (>2 mm increase) and recovery undershoot, with a more pronounced and prolonged undershoot in cKO mice. In addition, cKO glial cells were more depolarized, and, in contrast to those from WT mice, their membrane potential did not follow the stimulation-induced [K(+)](o) changes, reflecting the loss of their high potassium permeability. Our in vivo results support the role of K(ir)4.1 in setting the membrane potential of glial cells and its contribution to the glial potassium permeability. In addition, our data confirm the necessity of the K(ir)4.1 channel for an efficient uptake of K(+) by glial cells.",nocancer
"Early repeated 18F-FDG PET scans during neoadjuvant chemoradiation fail to predict histopathologic response or survival benefit in adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. This study evaluated the role of (18)F-FDG PET as an early predictor of histopathologic response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and overall survival in patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus undergoing multimodal therapy. METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the esophagus underwent pretreatment and an intratreatment (18)F-FDG PET scan in the second week of a 6-wk regimen of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Histopathologic response and overall survival were correlated with percentage change in (18)F-FDG uptake (%Deltamaximum standardized uptake value [%DeltaSUVmax]). RESULTS: In 16 patients (43%), treatment induced a histopathologic response (<10% viable tumor cells), which was associated with a significant (P < 0.05) survival benefit. The optimal reduction in (18)F-FDG uptake, which separated histopathologic responders and nonresponders, was a -26.4% DeltaSUVmax (receiver-operating-characteristic curve analysis). At this separation, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) were 62.5%, 71.4%, 62.5%, 71.4%, and 67.4%, respectively, for intratreatment (18)F-FDG PET scans. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of (18)F-FDG PET responders (>26.4% reduction in SUVmax), compared with (18)F-FDG PET nonresponders (<26.4% reduction in SUVmax), revealed no survival benefit for responders (P = 0.6812). CONCLUSION: The %DeltaSUVmax during the second week of induction chemoradiation did not correlate either with histopathologic response or with survival. Our results show that, in contrast to published reports on neoadjuvant chemotherapy, combined chemoradiotherapy in patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus lowers the predictive accuracy of early repeated (18)F-FDG PET in identifying histopathologic responders and those with chances for increased survival below clinically applicable levels.",cancer
"A multidimensional approach to the geriatric patient with chronic kidney disease. The prognostic evaluation of elderly patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) plays a key role in the decision analyses of care processes. It is increasingly evident that the prognosis of older patients with CKD is strongly affected by functional and cognitive status, body composition and nutrition, comorbidity and treatments and other factors that are not directly related to the index disease. The comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is a multidimensional diagnostic process intended to determine an elderly person?s medical, functional and psychosocial capacity and problems, with the objective of developing an overall plan for treatment and follow-up. The potential usefulness of the CGA in evaluating treatment and follow-up of older patients with CKD is unknown. In this paper we reported the efficacy of the Multidimensional Prognostic Index (MPI), calculated from information collected by a standardized CGA, in predicting mortality risk in older patients hospitalized with CKD. The CGA included 6 standardized scales: Activities of Daily Living (ADL), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ), Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), Exton-Smith score (ESS) and Cumulative Index Rating Scale (CIRS), as well as information on medication history and cohabitation, for a total of 63 items. The MPI was calculated from the integrated total scores and expressed as MPI 1 = low risk, MPI 2 = moderate risk and MPI 3 = severe risk of mortality. Higher MPI values were significantly associated with higher 1-year mortality in older patients with CKD. Moreover, MPI showed a greater discriminatory power than organ-specific prognostic indexes such as the estimated glomerular filtration rate. All of these findings support the concept that a multidimensional approach may be appropriate for the evaluation of older patients with CKD, as has been reported for patients with other pathological conditions.",nocancer

"First-line treatment with zoledronic acid as compared with clodronic acid in multiple myeloma (MRC Myeloma IX): a randomised controlled trial. BACKGROUND: Bisphosphonates reduce the risk of skeletal events in patients with malignant bone disease, and zoledronic acid has shown potential anticancer effects in preclinical and clinical studies. We aimed to establish whether bisphosphonates can affect clinical outcomes in patients with multiple myeloma. METHODS: Patients of age 18 years or older with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma were enrolled from 120 centres in the UK. Computer-generated randomisation sequence was used to allocate patients equally, via an automated telephone service, to receive 4 mg zoledronic acid as an infusion every 3-4 weeks or 1600 mg oral clodronic acid daily. Patients also received intensive or non-intensive induction chemotherapy. No investigators, staff, or patients were masked to treatment allocation, and bisphosphonate and maintenance therapy continued at least until disease progression. The primary endpoints were overall survival, progression-free survival, and overall response rate. We assessed between-group differences with Cox proportional hazards models for progression-free survival and overall survival, and with logistic regression models for overall response rate. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN68454111. FINDINGS: 1970 patients were enrolled between May, 2003, and November, 2007, of whom 1960 were eligible for intention-to-treat analysis: 981 in the zoledronic acid group (555 on intensive chemotherapy, 426 on non-intensive chemotherapy); and 979 on clodronic acid (556 on intensive chemotherapy, 423 on non-intensive chemotherapy). The treatment cutoff was Oct 5, 2009, with patients receiving bisphosphonates for a median of 350 days (IQR 137-632) before disease progression, with a median of 3.7 years' follow-up (IQR 2.9-4.7). Zoledronic acid reduced mortality by 16% (95% CI 4-26) versus clodronic acid (hazard ratio [HR] 0.84, 95% CI 0.74-0.96; p=0.0118), and extended median overall survival by 5.5 months (50.0 months, IQR 21.0 to not reached vs 44.5 months, IQR 16.5 to not reached; p=0.04). Zoledronic acid also significantly improved progression-free survival by 12% (95% CI 2-20) versus clodronic acid (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80-0.98; p=0.0179), and increased median progression-free survival by 2.0 months (19.5 months, IQR 9.0-38.0 vs 17.5 months, IQR 8.5-34.0; p=0.07). Rates of complete, very good partial, or partial response did not differ significantly between the zoledronic acid and clodronic acid groups for patients receiving intensive induction chemotherapy (432 patients [78%] vs 422 [76%]; p=0.43) or non-intensive induction chemotherapy (215 [50%] vs 195 [46%]; p=0.18). Both bisphosphonates were generally well tolerated, with similar occurrence of acute renal failure and treatment-emergent serious adverse events, but zoledronic acid was associated with higher rates of confirmed osteonecrosis of the jaw (35 [4%]) than was clodronic acid (3 [<1%]). INTERPRETATION: Consistent with the potential anticancer activity of zoledronic acid, overall survival improved independently of prevention of skeletal-related events, showing that zoledronic acid has treatment benefits beyond bone health. These findings support immediate treatment with zoledronic acid in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, not only for prevention of skeletal-related events, but also for potential antimyeloma benefits.

"Improvement of early 18F-FDG PET interpretation in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: importance of the reference background. This study investigated whether the reference background above which a residual mass is considered positive in the International Harmonization Project criteria should be modified for early (18)F-FDG PET evaluation. METHODS: In 92 patients with newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, the maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was measured on post-cycle 2 PET in the most intense residual mass (or, in the case of negative PET findings, in the area of most intense tumor uptake before therapy), in the mediastinal blood pool (MBP) and the liver, as potential reference background tissues. RESULTS: With MBP as a reference (SUVmax, 2.0 +/- 0.6), PET was unable to distinguish early responders from nonresponders. In contrast, with liver as a reference (SUVmax, 2.5 +/- 0.7), 2-y progression-free survival was significantly different between patients with PET-negative findings (81.8% [95% confidence interval, 71%-93%]) and patients with PET-positive findings (51.8% [95% confidence interval, 35%-69%], P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: When assessing early response, particularly in risk-adapted therapeutic trials, it seems preferable to refer to a background tissue (liver) with a higher level of uptake than that of current international criteria (MBP) which were designed for end-of-treatment evaluation.",cancer
"Profile of patients of leptospirosis in sub-Himalayan region of North India. CONTEXT: Leptospirosis is an emerging zoonosis world wide; it is being reported in many areas of south-east Asia now. A recent surge in the number of patients with leptospirosis has been noted in the Sub-Himalayan region of North India which was uncommon. We present here a case series of 13 patients who were positive for leptospirosis either by IgM Elisa or PCR method. AIMS: To study the profile of leptospirosis in a sub-Himalayan state of North India i.e. Himachal Pradesh. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This was a retrospective study of leptospira positive patients who were admitted in IGMC, Shimla. The study was conducted in Indira Gandhi Medical College, Shimla situated at a moderate altitude in North India. METHODS AND MATERIAL: All patients presenting in Medical College Hospital during three months from 1st August to 31st October who tested IgM positive or borderline or PCR positive for leptospirosis were taken into the study. Their presenting complaints, examination findings and lab findings were recorded and analyzed based on the Faine's criteria and modified Faine's criteria. Patients with clinical features of Leptospirosis and who tested positive for IgM Leptospirosis were taken as IgM lepto can be falsely positive. RESULTS: Out of total 13 patients there were 3 males and 10 females, age range was from 24 to 78 yrs and mean was 44 yrs. Predominant complaints were fever, jaundice, myalgia, and headache. All had contact with animals or contaminated environment. LFT's were deranged in 12 and renal functions were deranged in all. Ten had positive results for IgM against leptospira while 2 had borderline positive result. One patient was positive by PCR method using G1, G2 primers. Ten patients had Weil's syndrome and this was the main presentation of leptospirosis in our group, one had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and needed ventilator. There were no deaths. All responded to injectable ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline. Applying Faine's criteria only 7 were positive, but using modified Faine's criteria all 13 were positive for leptospirosis. CONCLUSIONS: Leptospirosis was unexpectedly found to be positive in many of our patients who were having pyrexia during the monsoons. A recent surge has been noted in the number of cases with leptospirosis in this state. The possibility of co-infection especially with scrub typhus must be considered in cases with atypical presentation and severe illness. Most of the patients were from rural background with poor hygienic conditions. There was no mortality and main complication was Weil's syndrome in 77 percent.",nocancer
"Diets with high or low protein content and glycemic index for weight-loss maintenance. BACKGROUND: Studies of weight-control diets that are high in protein or low in glycemic index have reached varied conclusions, probably owing to the fact that the studies had insufficient power. METHODS: We enrolled overweight adults from eight European countries who had lost at least 8% of their initial body weight with a 3.3-MJ (800-kcal) low-calorie diet. Participants were randomly assigned, in a two-by-two factorial design, to one of five ad libitum diets to prevent weight regain over a 26-week period: a low-protein and low-glycemic-index diet, a low-protein and high-glycemic-index diet, a high-protein and low-glycemic-index diet, a high-protein and high-glycemic-index diet, or a control diet. RESULTS: A total of 1209 adults were screened (mean age, 41 years; body-mass index [the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters], 34), of whom 938 entered the low-calorie-diet phase of the study. A total of 773 participants who completed that phase were randomly assigned to one of the five maintenance diets; 548 completed the intervention (71%). Fewer participants in the high-protein and the low-glycemic-index groups than in the low-protein-high-glycemic-index group dropped out of the study (26.4% and 25.6%, respectively, vs. 37.4%; P=0.02 and P=0.01 for the respective comparisons). The mean initial weight loss with the low-calorie diet was 11.0 kg. In the analysis of participants who completed the study, only the low-protein-high-glycemic-index diet was associated with subsequent significant weight regain (1.67 kg; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48 to 2.87). In an intention-to-treat analysis, the weight regain was 0.93 kg less (95% CI, 0.31 to 1.55) in the groups assigned to a high-protein diet than in those assigned to a low-protein diet (P=0.003) and 0.95 kg less (95% CI, 0.33 to 1.57) in the groups assigned to a low-glycemic-index diet than in those assigned to a high-glycemic-index diet (P=0.003). The analysis involving participants who completed the intervention produced similar results. The groups did not differ significantly with respect to diet-related adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In this large European study, a modest increase in protein content and a modest reduction in the glycemic index led to an improvement in study completion and maintenance of weight loss.

"Time trends in the prevalence of diabetes mellitus: ten year analysis from southern India (1994-2004) on 19,072 subjects with diabetes. OBJECTIVE: To assess the time trends in the prevalence of diabetes at our Centre from 1994-2004 (N: 19,072 individuals) on the following parameters: age group, sex, rural or urban area and individuals with freshly diagnosed diabetes versus known diabetes. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Analysis of data from electronic medical records at a referral Endocrine and Diabetes Centre in Southern India. METHODS: We have employed the period prevalence method and person-time risk to express the results. The concept of person-time risk can be estimated as the actual time-at-risk in years that all persons contributed to a study. The person-time can be estimated for each patient when a patient changed from diabetic free to diabetic patient. This can be captured for each patient from the variable onset of first diagnoses as a diabetic patient. Thus person-time is employed to derive information on the rate at which people acquire the disease. RESULTS: Between 1994 and 2004 however there is an increasing trend in the number of individuals in the young, particularly the 18-34 year group. Similarly there is a steadily increasing pattern in both urban and rural areas; the number from rural areas tended to increase compared to urban areas. The number of women with diabetes tended to increase over the 10-year period. CONCLUSION: Between 1994 and 2004 among persons with diabetes who presented at our Centre, there was a trend toward more number of younger persons, particularly women from rural areas.",nocancer

RESULTS: Overall hospital mortality was 3.9% with biological valves (n = 15; elective: 3.7% [n = 10]) versus 2.8% with mechanical valves (n = 8; elective: 1.4% [n = 3]). In patients 50 to 70 years, age greater than 65 years (relative risk: 3.3 [P = .0001]), clot (relative risk: 2.5 [P = .05]), coronary artery disease (relative risk:3.5 [P < .0001]), and degenerative etiology (relative risk: 0.4 [P = .006]) were independent risk factors for long-term survival (after postoperative day 30); there was no difference in long-term survival between biological and mechanical valves (relative risk: 0.9 [P = .74]). The linearized rate for valve/ascending aorta reoperation was 0.86%/pt-y (2 in 2310 pt-y) after mechanical valves and 2.5%/pt-y (4 in 1586 pt-y) after Bentall procedures with the biological valve. CONCLUSIONS: The choice of valve for aortic root reconstruction seems to have no influence on long-term outcome. Emergency operation and the presence of clot/atheroma have a significant impact on short-term outcome. Reoperation for either ascending aorta and/or aortic valve is low.",nocancer
Ineffective breathing pattern in children with congenital heart disease: definitions and outcomes. AIM: To check the content validity of operational definitions for respiratory indicators of ineffective breathing pattern of children with congenital heart disease. METHODS: A methodologic study performed with Brazilian expert nurses that assesses the item-objective congruence and adequacy of criteria of operational definitions for indicators of ineffective breathing pattern. RESULTS: Thirty two indicators presented item-objective congruence higher than 0.80. The content validity index higher than 0.80 was identified in at least 16 indicators for each criterion. CONCLUSION: Implementation of these concepts is helpful but they need to be kept under review.,nocancer
"Diagnostic challenges in the pathologic evaluation of Barrett esophagus. CONTEXT: Barrett esophagus represents an unstable epithelium resulting from chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease. Patients with Barrett esophagus routinely undergo endoscopic examination to detect dysplasia and early carcinoma. Although appropriate classification of Barrett esophagus and neoplasia is usually straightforward, persistent esophageal inflammation may induce epithelial changes that mimic, or mask, dysplasia. Recent data also indicate that specific molecular changes occur in nondysplastic Barrett mucosa and herald the development of dysplasia and/or carcinoma. OBJECTIVE: To describe problematic aspects of biopsy interpretation in tissue samples of the gastroesophageal junction and distal esophagus, including the diagnostic criteria for Barrett esophagus, the importance of the gastric cardia, and pitfalls to the diagnosis of dysplasia. Ancillary studies that have recently emerged as potential adjuncts to the evaluation of patients with Barrett esophagus will be briefly discussed. DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive review of the relevant literature indexed in PubMed (National Library of Medicine) was performed. CONCLUSIONS: Barrett esophagus is currently defined as the presence of intestinal metaplasia in samples obtained from an endoscopically evident abnormality in the distal esophagus. Diagnosis and grading of dysplasia in mucosal biopsies remain the most reliable method to assess risk for neoplastic progression, but its classification may be hindered by superimposed inflammatory changes and suffers from considerable interobserver variability. Therefore, immunohistochemical studies and molecular assessment for TP53, CDKN2A , and DNA content abnormalities have emerged as potential adjuncts to the detection of dysplasia.",cancer
"The traumatic roots of containment: the evolution of Bion's metapsychology. W. R. Bion wrote repeatedly about his World War I experiences as a tank officer, thus engaging in historicizing a traumatic emotional experience. A close reading of the many layers in these writings suggests that the war experiences influenced the metapsychology he created. The author argues that haunting questions regarding the ability of the mind to survive trauma led Bion to elaborate on the process of containing emotional experience, and hence to address the lack of an intricate theory of thinking in psychoanalytic metapsychology and to offer a vision of a mind struggling to survive, culminating in the growth of a postmodern consciousness.",nocancer
"Food consumption patterns of young preschoolers: are they starting off on the right path? OBJECTIVE: To describe the food consumption patterns of US children aged 2 and 3 years. DESIGN: Descriptive analysis of data collected in the Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study 2008 based on a single 24-hour dietary recall collected by telephone. SUBJECTS: A national random sample of children aged 2 and 3 years (n=1,461). STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: The percentage of children consuming foods from specific food groups was estimated for the full sample of children aged 2 and 3 years and separately by year of age. RESULTS: About a third of 2-year-olds and a quarter of 3-year-olds consumed whole milk at least once in a day. About 70% of 2- and 3-year-olds consumed vegetables as a distinct food item at least once in day. French fries and other fried potatoes were the most commonly consumed vegetable. Almost three quarters of children (73%) consumed fruit as a distinct food item at least once in a day, and 59% consumed 100% juice. Fresh fruit was the most commonly consumed type of fruit. About 85% of children consumed some type of sweetened beverage, dessert, sweet, or salty snack in a day. Percentages of children consuming such foods were consistently higher for 3-year-olds than for 2-year-olds. CONCLUSIONS: Parents and caregivers should be encouraged to expose young children to a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, and healthier fats, and to limit consumption of low-nutrient, energy-dense foods and beverages. Dietary guidance should stress the fact that children in this age group have high nutrient needs and relatively low energy requirements, leaving little room for such foods. Parents need advice that is specific, practical, and actionable.",nocancer
"Oxidative stress and aging. The fountain of youth has always been a myth for mankind. Aging is a physiologic state in which a progressive decline of organ functions is accompanied with the development of age-related diseases. The causes of aging remain unknown, probably being related to a multifactorial process. To date, the free radical and mitochondrial theories seem to be the 2 most prominent theories on aging and have survived the test of time. Such theories claim that oxidative stress within mitochondria can lead to a vicious cycle in which damaged mitochondria produce increased amounts of reactive oxygen species, leading in turn to progressive augmentation in damage. If aging results from oxidative stress, it may be corrected by environmental, nutritional and pharmacological strategies. This review summarizes the role of free radicals and oxidative stress in developing aging in kidney and human pathologies.",nocancer
"Regularized antenna profile adaptation in online hyperthermia treatment. PURPOSE: Online optimization of annular-phased-array hyperthermia (HT) is based on planning tools and magnetic resonance (MR) thermometry. Until now, the method has been validated in phantoms. Further developments and extensions are required for clinical purposes. In particular, the problem of deducing the electric field distribution inside the patient from MR thermometry is ill-posed, which leads to an amplification of measurement errors. A method to overcome this difficulty is proposed. METHODS: The authors utilized a regularized Gauss-Newton algorithm with a fast bioheat transfer equation (BHTE) approximation to identify the field parameters. To evaluate the method, simulations with patient models are conducted and a treatment data set obtained from a heat treatment performed in the hybrid HT-MR system at the Charite Medical School is used to visualize the error amplification. RESULTS: The regularization leads to a significantly improved accuracy of the predicted electric fields and temperatures compared to an unregularized approach. The BHTE approximation enables highly accurate temperature predictions in real-time. CONCLUSIONS: Regularization proves to be necessary to identify electromagnetic field parameters. The proposed method is able to reproduce measurements without overfitting to the noise in the MR measurements and results in an improved treatment planning.",cancer

"The influence of storage period on the antioxidants level of red blood cells and the plasma before transfusion. Stored blood is used for transfusion in humans but peroxidative processes occur in stored blood before transfusion. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of the length of storage on plasma antioxidant levels and RBCs antioxidant enzyme activity. Blood collected from 15 donors and preserved with anticoagulant (citerate phosphate, dextrose adenine (CPDA-1) were examined. The concentration of total antioxidant status (TAS), malondialdehyde (MDA) and potassium (K+) in the plasma as well as glutathione peroxidise (GSH- Px), glutathione superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities in erythrocytes were determined on days 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 of storage. Day 1 of the study is the day of donation. A 24.8% increase in plasma concentration of MDA and 15.8% increase in the concentration K+ on day 15 were recorded (p < 0.05). A 27% decrease in the plasma concentration of TAS was observed on day 20 compared with day 1 (p < 0.05). Similarly GSH-Px activity is stored RBC decreased by 17.1%, on day 15 (p < 0.05). SOD activities reduced by 17.1% on day 20, CAT activities reduced by 12.6% on day 15 (in each case p < 0.05). In this study blood stored in CPDA-1 shows that those glutathione-dependent antioxidant enzymes systems in erythrocytes and antioxidant defence in plasma were depleting gradually depending on the day of storage. We concluded based on our finding that 10 days period can be considered a safe storage limits for transfusion in relation to oxidative stress the RBCs were subjected in the storage medium.",nocancer
"Incidence and risk factors of renal dysfunction after thoracic endovascular aortic repair. OBJECTIVES: The risk of renal failure after thoracic endovascular aortic repair is not widely established. The aim of this study was to assess the incidence and risk factors of renal failure. METHODS: Between 1998 and 2008, 175 consecutive patients underwent 210 procedures at 2 tertiary academic institutions. Similar nephroprotective protocols and intravascular ultrasound were used. Retrospective analysis was performed. Generalized linear model was used to identify factors associated with change in postoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate. RESULTS: Underlying aortic diseases included 103 aneurysms, 72 dissections, 21 transections, and 14 penetrating ulcers. Median preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate was 65 mL . min(-1) . 1.73 m(-2). Contrast media averaged 108.7 +/- 69.8 mL. Median estimated glomerular filtration rates within 48 hours and 30 days were 69 and 67 mL . min(-1) . 1.73 m(-2), respectively. Rates of acute renal dysfunction risk (>25% estimated glomerular filtration rate decrease), acute kidney injury (>50% estimated glomerular filtration rate decrease), acute kidney function failure (>75% estimated glomerular filtration rate decrease), and hemodialysis were 9.8% (19/193), 1.6% (3/193), 0% (0/193), and 0.5% (1/193), respectively. Rates of renal dysfunction at 1 month and 6 months were 13.3% (10/75) and 17.7% (6/34), respectively. Risk factors for acute renal dysfunction were intraoperative hypotension, stroke, sepsis, lengthy procedures, and number of stents; at 1 and 6 months they were increased age, male gender, African American race, diabetes mellitus, chronic pulmonary disease, smoking, and zone 0 to 1 graft deployment. Obesity was nephroprotective. CONCLUSIONS: Thoracic aortic endograft has a significant rate of renal dysfunction; however, it is lower in this cohort than in previous smaller series. Routine use of intravascular ultrasound and reduced contrast may have contributed to lower rates of renal insufficiency.",nocancer

"Calcium and magnesium in drinking water and risk of death from kidney cancer. The possible association between the risk of kidney cancer development and the levels of calcium and magnesium in drinking water from municipal supplies was investigated in a matched cancer case-control study in Taiwan. All eligible kidney cancer deaths (1778 cases) of Taiwan residents from 1999 through 2008 were compared with deaths from other causes (1778 controls), and the levels of calcium and magnesium in drinking water of these residents were determined. Data on calcium and magnesium levels in drinking water throughout Taiwan were obtained from the Taiwan Water Supply Corporation (TWSC). The control group consisted of individuals who died from other causes, and the controls were pair-matched to the cancer cases by gender, year of birth, and year of death. The adjusted odd ratios for death attributed to kidney cancer for individuals with higher calcium levels in their drinking water, as compared to the lowest tertile, were 0.89 (95% CI = 0.72-1.11) and 0.78 (95% CI = 0.62-0.98), respectively. The adjusted odd ratios were not statistically significant for the relationship between magnesium levels in drinking water and kidney cancer development. The results of the present study demonstrate that there may be a significant protective effect of calcium intake from drinking water against the risk of death due to kidney cancer.",cancer
"Correlation of pepsin-measured laryngopharyngeal reflux disease with symptoms and signs. OBJECTIVE: Pepsin detection in throat sputum has been posited as a reliable biological marker of laryngopharyngeal reflux disease (LPRD). This study was designed to further correlate pepsin concentration with symptoms and signs of LPRD. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Nanfang Hospital of Southern Medical University. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fifty-six laryngitis patients were divided into a reflux laryngitis group and a chronic laryngitis group based on the reflux symptom index (RSI), reflux finding score (RFS), and proton pump inhibitor treatment for two weeks. Oral and hypopharyngeal secretions from the study patients and from 15 healthy subjects were collected. Thirty-six obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients were divided into a mild-moderate group and a severe group by the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). Bedtime and first-morning oral secretions were collected. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the pepsin concentration. RESULTS: In laryngitis patients, the total score of RSI and RFS (P < 0.05), and the symptoms, including clearing throat often, coughing, and sensing a lump in the throat (P < 0.006), were more severe in the pepsin-positive group. No significant differences were found between the oral and hypopharyngeal secretions. In OSA, pepsin levels in the first-morning oral secretions were correlated with AHI, mean SaO(2), and mini SaO(2) (P < 0.01). However, RSIs were not significantly correlated with these indicators. CONCLUSION: Higher levels of pepsin in sputum were associated with higher RSI and RFS in cases of laryngitis. There was no relationship between pepsin levels and RSI in cases of OSA. There were no differences of pepsin concentration in sputum collection methods or in collection timing.",nocancer

"Follow-up in a long-term randomized trial with neoadjuvant chemotherapy for squamous cell cervical carcinoma. OBJECTIVE: To assess the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy to achieve radical surgery in a larger number of patients with locally advanced/or bulky Stage IB cervical carcinoma. We conducted a trial to determine whether neoadjuvant chemotherapy would improve disease-free survival and overall survival in Stage IB-III cervical cancer. DESIGN: Prospective randomized clinical study with long-term follow-up. SETTING: Department of Gynecology, Perinatology and Child Health, II Faculty University of Rome ""La Sapienza"". METHODS: 288 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix, FIGO Stage IB-IIIB were randomized to one of the following treatments: three courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin, vincristine, bleomycin (NACT arm; n = 159); conventional surgery or exclusive radiotherapy (CONV arm; n = 129). There was no difference in age, FIGO stage, tumor size and lymph node involvement between the two groups (p = ns). Two hundred and thirty-four patients in Stage IB-IIb (n = 129 NACT arm and n = 105 CONV arm) and 24 patients in Stage III (NACT arm) who proved to be chemosensitive underwent radical hysterectomy. Six Stage III patients, non responders to chemotherapy, and 24 patients, Stage III of the CONV arm, underwent radiotherapy. Follow-up extended for seven years. RESULTS: The study was performed on disease-free survival related to several prognostic factors: age, FIGO stage, tumor size, grading, parametrial involvement, lymph node status and surgical margins. Recurrence of disease occurred in 49 (32.1%) patients of the NACT arm (n = 153) and in 39 (37.1%). patients of the CONV arm (n = 105). Statistically significant differences in the recurrence of the disease were related to FIGO stage (p < 003), grading (p < .05), parametrial involvement (p < .002) lymph node status (p < .0001) and tumor size (p <.002). No statistical significance was related to age and surgical margins (p = ns).

"Can cord formation in BACTEC MGIT 960 medium be used as a presumptive method for identification of M. tuberculosis complex? BACKGROUND: Serpentine cord formation in BACTEC MGIT 960 medium was evaluated as a rapid method for the presumptive identification of M. tuberculosis complex (MTBC). MATERIAL & METHODS: Total 2527 samples were processed for AFB culture using MGIT 960 TB system over a period of three months. AFB smears were prepared from 1000 MGIT tubes flagged positive by the MGIT instrument and stained by ZN method to examine presence or absence of serpentine cording. The cord formation was compared with PNBA [p-nitro benzoic acid] test on MGIT system and all controversial cases were further evaluated by NAP [p-nitro-a-acetylamino-phydroxypropiophenone] test on BACTEC 460 TB system. RESULTS & DISCUSSION: Of the 1000 culture positives, 904 (90.4%) were identified as mycobacteria, of which 869 (96%) showed cording by smear microscopy. One (0.1%) was identified as nocardia. In the remaining 95 (9.5%) cases, primary smear made from MGIT vial was negative. Of 869 cultures showing serpentine cord formation, 842 were confirmed as MTBC and 27 as NTM by PNBA assay on MGIT 960 TB system. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values are found to be 99.6%, 54%, 96% and 91% respectively. An average detection time for PNBA assay was found to be eight days whereas cording results were available on the same day of culture positivity. CONCLUSION: Though highly sensitive it is not very specific and hence cannot be the only test for presumptive diagnosis of MTBC.",nocancer
"Radiation bowel disease and its clinical implication. Pre-operative radiotherapy may induce radiation colitis and tumour regression. Histological evaluation of radiation colitis needs to be reproducible to assess disease progression. The severity of radiation colitis can be assessed and graded according to its histological features. Increased severity of disease appears to be associated with a higher degree of cellular atypia and a lesser eosinophilic infiltrate. The severity of histological changes does not appear to be associated with post-operative complications. Tumour regression is an interesting phenomenon, the histological grading of which is of prognostic importance. Patients treated with long course radiotherapoy appear to have more incidences of postoperative complications. However, these are though to be related to the degree of tumour regression rather than to the type of radiotherapy.",cancer
"Pelvic tuberculosis continues to be a disease of dilemma--case series. Tuberculosis (TB) has become a global epidemic again with emergence of HIV/AIDS and multi-drug resistant strains of TB. Female genital tuberculosis (GT) is typically a disease of young women and its occurrence in post menopausal women is rare. Amongst the genital disorders, GT is the most baffling especially because of its various presentations. So GT is notorious for evading diagnosis. A series of cases of females GT between the age 25 yrs to 40 yrs is being reported with women having spectrum of clinical features, creating diagnostic dilemma and so final diagnosis by histopathology after laparotomy. So a high degree of suspicion aided by intensive investigations may be required for the diagnosis of GT. Medical therapy is the main treatment, however some do need surgery. Research needs to be continued for early establishment of timely diagnosis of GT and modalities of effective therapies.",nocancer
"Ipilimumab: unleashing the power of the immune system through CTLA-4 blockade. Malignant melanoma is rising faster in incidence than any other malignancy. Long-term remission or ""cure"" is rare and is almost exclusively limited to therapies that stimulate an immune antitumor response. Ipilimumab is a novel targeted human immunostimulatory monoclonal antibody that blocks cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen4 (CTLA-4), an immune-inhibitory site expressed on activated T cells. Ipilimumab is well tolerated as an outpatient infusion therapy. Multiple studies have confirmed significant antimelanoma activity. A randomized trial has documented a survival benefit when ipilimumab was compared to a gp-100 vaccine only arm. The unique mechanism of action of ipilimumab makes assessment of response by conventional criteria difficult. Benefit from ipilimumab can occur after what would be considered progression with World Health Oganization (WHO) or Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. New immune response criteria have been proposed. Therapeutic responses peak between 12 and 24 weeks, with slow responses continuing up to and beyond 12 months. The major drug- related adverse side effects (10%-15% grade 3 or above) are immune-related and consist most commonly of rash, colitis, hypophysitis, thyroiditis, and hepatitis. Colonic perforation can occur and patients with diarrhea have to be monitored carefully with strict adherence to treatment algorithms. Algorithms for the treatment of other adverse side effects have been developed. The treatment of immune-related side effects with immunosuppressive agents, such as corticosteroids, does not appear to impair antitumor response. With proper monitoring and management of side effects, ipilimumab is an extremely safe drug to administer. The benefits of ipilimumab will most certainly extend to other malignancies in the near future.",cancer
"A benign metastasizing leiomyoma involving a nodule in the pulmonary artery: case and literature review. Benign metastasizing leiomyoma (BML) is a rare disease defined as a primary benign uterine tumor with ""metastatic"" lesions preferentially occurring in the lung, pelvis and lymph nodes. There are few reports about local recurrence after initial surgery. We report a case of a BML with local recurrence and metastasis growing into the wall of the left pulmonary artery, diagnosed 11 years after initial hysterectomy. A 55-year-old woman complaining of abdominal discomfort, heaviness and asthenia was admitted to our hospital for investigation of a voluminous uterine mass with high vascularization and three pulmonary nodules. The resection of the mass by laparotomy was complicated by uncontrolled severe hemorrhage due to vascular proliferation, requiring multiple transfusions, packing the cavity and postoperative uterine artery embolization. Three months later the patient underwent a left upper lobe lobectomy with the aim of removing the largest pulmonary nodule, a nodule a located in the lingular branch of the left pulmonary artery. The comparison of hysterectomy and lobectomy pieces showed a similar aspect, leading thus to the diagnosis of BML. Awareness of this rare entity should potentially avoid under-diagnosis and difficulties due to hemorrhage during surgery.",cancer

"Glycemic control and weight reduction without causing hypoglycemia: the case for continued safe aggressive care of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and avoidance of therapeutic inertia. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major and growing concern in the United States, in large part because of an epidemic of obesity in America and its relation to type 2 DM. In affected patients, postprandial glucose may be an early indicator of glucose intolerance or a prediabetes condition, which may be a better predictor of cardiovascular risk than impaired fasting glucose level. Treating patients who have early signs of hyperglycemia, including elevated postprandial glucose level, with intensive glucose control that does not lead to weight gain, and ideally may be associated with weight reduction, may be vital to preventing or reducing later cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Because hypoglycemia is an important complication of current DM treatments and may cause acute secondary adverse cardiovascular outcomes, not causing hypoglycemia is mandatory. Given that weight loss can significantly lower cardiovascular risk and improve other cardiovascular risk factors in patients with type 2 DM and that medications are available that can result in weight reduction without leading to hypoglycemia, the successful treatment of patients with type 2 DM should be individualized and should address the complete pathophysiologic process. This review is a hypothesis article that presents arguments against general approaches to the treatment of type 2 DM. An algorithm is presented in which the goal for managing patients with type 2 DM is to lower the blood glucose level as much as possible for as long as possible without causing hypoglycemia. In addition, body weight should ideally be improved, reducing cardiovascular risk factors and avoiding therapeutic inertia.",nocancer
"Dimensional versus categorical use of the PHQ-9 depression scale among persons with non-small-cell lung cancer: a pilot study including quality-of-life comparisons. The debate over the relative usefulness of categorical (yes/no) versus dimensional (continuous scales) assessments for determining mental illness has been running strong for nearly a half century. In order to address the utility of each of these assessment methods within the cancer population, in the present study, the dimensional and categorical scoring systems of the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression were compared among patients (n = 14) in the pretreatment stages for locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Also included in the study was an additional dimensional measure of depression, the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). As predicted, dimensional assessments resulted in higher estimates of depression than did the categorical assessment. As predicted, the dimensional depression assessments, including the PHQ-9 and the BDI-II, which showed depression prevalence rates of 43% and 36%, respectively, produced higher estimates of depression than did the categorical system of the PHQ-9, whose use did not result in any patients being diagnosed with major depression or other depression. Also, as predicted, in terms of quality of life, patients found to be depressed by both the BDI-II and the dimensional PHQ-9 reported significantly worse physical, functional, and emotional well-being than did their nondepressed counterparts. Study findings suggest a need for further investigation into the possibility that patients who score highly on the dimensional scoring system of the PHQ-9 but at values below threshold on the more commonly accepted categorical scoring system of the same measure would benefit from consideration for psychotherapeutic treatment.",cancer
"Veteran tobacco use, low-density lipoprotein, and glycated hemoglobin levels.

Descriptive statistics and two repeated measures ANCOVA were performed to determine the demographic characteristics of the sample and the relationships between the independent variable of tobacco use group on the dependent variables of LDL cholesterol and HbA1c levels, during the years 2003 through 2007. There was no statistically significant relationship between tobacco use and LDL levels when controlling for weight. There was a statistically significant difference in the tobacco use groups and HbA1c levels. Current smokers had higher HbA1c levels than did former smokers throughout the observational period, but the difference was statistically significant only for the years 2003 and 2007.

"Checking in healthcare safety: theoretical basis and practical application. PURPOSE: Healthcare includes important processes such as checking to reduce errors. Checking is a prescribed part of many patient care activities with many checks being performed during one hospital admission. Some may be standard but unwritten practices, whereas others are laid down in official guidance. Errors in the bedside checking procedure are the commonest cause of mis-transfusion, so more thorough checking could prevent adverse events. This paper aims to explore and enhance understanding regarding healthcare checking procedures. In doing so it seeks to identify a further research agenda. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The computerised databases CINAHL, PsycLIT, EMBASE, PubMed, PsycINFO and MEDLINE were searched using specific indexing terms and free text including ""bedside, peri-operative safety, theatre checking and checklists"". Only English publications were included. FINDINGS: Like any human activity, checking is part of personality and behaviour. There are several psychological factors relevant to patient safety, including: memory, prospective memory, automaticity and responsibility. All are relevant to healthcare. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: Bandolier criteria have not explicitly been used within this review but have been met. It would be beneficial for future reviews to explicitly state how Bandolier criteria are met. This would possibly enhance the publications' scientific quality. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: There is much to learn regarding interacting factors that influence healthcare checking procedures and ultimately checking performance. The authors recommend that relationships between checking and personality should be explored. Furthermore, exploring how healthcare ""mindfulness"" might be promoted and what reminder/checking strategies healthcare staff already use in their day-to-day work routines should be examined. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: Several psychological factors involved in checking and its relevance to healthcare and patient safety are identified. Additionally, recommendations for further research are indicated.",nocancer
"Tephrosin-induced autophagic cell death in A549 non-small cell lung cancer cells. Anticancer effect of tephrosin (1) has been documented; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the cytotoxicity of tephrosin in cancer cells remain unclear. In the present paper, the proliferation inhibition rate of several cancer cells was tested using the MTT assay; cell cycle, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were determined by flow cytometry; poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage and heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) expression were evaluated by Western blotting; autophagy was examined by confocal microscopy and light chain 3 (LC3) conversion assay. The results showed that exposure of the cells to tephrosin induced significant proliferation inhibition in a dose-dependent manner, especially on A549 with G(2)/M being arrested. Tephrosin was not found to induce cell apoptosis as PARP cleavage was not detected after 24 h treatment, but the formation of acidic vesicular organelle of autophagy character was found, and autophagy was further confirmed by the increase in the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I. It was observed that tephrosin induced ROS generation and Hsp90 expression inhibition. These results indicate that tephrosin induces A549 cancer cell death via the autophagy pathway, and the roles of ROS generation and Hsp90 expression inhibition in this process need further study in the future.",cancer
"The joint effect of hOGG1 single nucleotide polymorphism and smoking habit on lung cancer in Taiwan. AIM: To evaluate the association and interaction among human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (hOGG1) genotypic polymorphism, smoking status and lung cancer risk in Taiwan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The gene for hOGG1 was analyzed via polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) in 358 patients with lung cancer and 716 healthy controls recruited from the China Medical Hospital. RESULTS: The hOGG1 codon 326 genotypes were not differently distributed between the lung cancer and control groups (p=0.0809). However, the C allele of hOGG1 codon 326 was significantly (p=0.0198) more frequently found in controls than in cancer patients. We further analyzed the joint effect of genetics and smoking on lung cancer risk and found an interaction between hOGG1 codon 326 genotypes and smoking status. The hOGG1 codon 326 C allele-bearing genotypes were significantly associated with lung cancer risk only in the smoker group (p=0.0132), but not in the non-smoker group (p=0.06588). CONCLUSION: Our results provide evidence that the C allele of hOGG1 codon 326 may have a joint effect with smoking on the development of lung cancer.",cancer
"Dietary fatty acids and the aging brain. Aging contributes to physiological decline and vulnerability to disease. In the brain, even with minimal neuronal loss, aging increases oxidative damage, inflammation, demyelination, impaired processing, and metabolic deficits, particularly during pathological brain aging. In this review, the possible role of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the prevention of age-related disruption of brain function is discussed. High-fat diabetogenic diets, cholesterol, and the omega-6 fatty acid arachidonate and its prostaglandin metabolites have all been implicated in promoting the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Evidence presented here shows DHA acts to oppose this, exerting a plethora of pleiotropic activities to protect against the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.",nocancer
"IL-2-activated haploidentical NK cells restore NKG2D-mediated NK-cell cytotoxicity in neuroblastoma patients by scavenging of plasma MICA. NK group 2D (NKG2D)-expressing NK cells exhibit cytolytic activity against various tumors after recognition of the cellular ligand MHC class I chain-related gene A (MICA). However, release of soluble MICA (sMICA) compromises NKG2D-dependent NK-cell cytotoxicity leading to tumor escape from immunosurveillance. Although some molecular details of the NKG2D-MICA interaction have been elucidated, its impact for donor NK (dNK) cell-based therapy of solid tumors has not been studied. Within an ongoing phase I/II trial, we used allogeneic IL-2 activated dNK cells after haploidentical stem cell transplantation for immunotherapy of patients with high-risk stage IV neuroblastoma. NKG2D levels on activated dNK cells increased strongly when compared with freshly isolated dNK cells and correlated with enhanced NK-cell cytotoxicity. Most importantly, elevated sMICA levels in patients plasma correlated significantly with impaired dNK-cell-mediated cytotoxicity. This effect could be reversed by high-dose infusion of activated dNK cells, which display high levels of surface NKG2D. Our data suggest that the provided excess of NKG2D leads to clearance of sMICA and preserves cytotoxicity of dNK cells via non-occupied NKG2D. In conclusion, our results identify this tumor immune escape mechanism as a target to improve immunotherapy of neuroblastoma and presumably other tumors.",cancer
"Malignant fibrous histiocytoma like pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma with laryngeal cancer as a second primary neoplasm: a case report. BACKGROUND: Leiomyosarcoma is one of the most common sarcomas arising in the soft tissue and somatic organs. Pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma (P-LMS) may be easily confused with a malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) as both may share nonspecific morphologic features. It is reported that the larynx is the most common site for a second primary neoplasm (SPN) in a patient with a head and neck malignancy, although an SPN of the larynx following a P-LMS is extremely rare. CASE: A 57-year-old male initially underwent fine needle aspiration (FNA) of a soft tissue tumor (STS) located in the left upper arm. FNA showed the presence of clustered, large tumor cells with clear, eosinophilic and ill-defined cytoplasm and pleomorphic nuclei. A diagnosis of an undifferentiated malignant tumor was made. Histology showed the presence of MFH. This diagnosis was changed to P-LMS following a lung metastasis. A laryngeal biopsy 37 months after the initial biopsy was performed and showed squamous carcinoma. This squamous carcinoma was presumed to be an SPN. CONCLUSION: This is the first case report of a patient with a P-LMS who then developed laryngeal squamous carcinoma as an SPN.",cancer
"Alcohol-related seizures. The term alcohol-related seizures (ARS) is used to refer to all seizures in the aggregate associated with alcohol use, including the subset of alcohol withdrawal seizures (AWS). From 20% to 40% of patients with seizure who present to an emergency department have seizures related to alcohol abuse. However, it is critical to avoid prematurely labeling a seizure as being caused by alcohol withdrawal before performing a careful diagnostic evaluation. Benzodiazepines alone are sufficient to prevent AWS. The alcoholic patient with a documented history of ARS, who experiences a single seizure or a short burst of seizures should be treated with lorazepam, 2 mg intravenously.",nocancer
"Retropleural teratoma presenting as an abdominal mass in a 9-month-old boy. BACKGROUND: Teratomas are rare tumors that present most commonly in the anterior mediastinum and retroperitoneum. To date, the retropleural primary site has not been reported. CASE PRESENTATION: A 9-month-old boy presented with a large, painless, right-sided abdominal mass. Laboratory values, including tumor markers alpha-fetoprotein and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin, were within normal limits. Diagnostic imaging, including abdominal ultrasound, computed tomographic scan, and magnetic resonance imaging, suggested a large retroperitoneal mass consistent with a teratoma. Because the mass was thought to be arising from the retroperitoneum, an abdominal approach was chosen. After adequate exposure, it became clear that the tumor was arising from above the diaphragm. The diaphragm was incised, and the pleural cavity was entered. The tumor was found in the retropleural space where it was dissected away from the inferior vena cava, aorta, and chest wall. The patient recovered without complications. RESULTS: Histologic examination revealed a mature cystic teratoma with no malignant features. The patient has been disease-free at 7-year follow-up, based upon both clinical examination and diagnostic imaging. CONCLUSION: This is the first case report of a teratoma arising from the retropleural space. Preoperative imaging may be inaccurate for guiding surgical planning because the diaphragm may not be clearly visualized with current diagnostic techniques. Surgeons should be cautious regarding the location of tumors that arise near the diaphragm and should plan surgical resection carefully.",cancer
"Variability in the measurement of hospital-wide mortality rates. BACKGROUND: Several countries use hospital-wide mortality rates to evaluate the quality of hospital care, although the usefulness of this metric has been questioned. Massachusetts policymakers recently requested an assessment of methods to calculate this aggregate mortality metric for use as a measure of hospital quality. METHODS: The Massachusetts Division of Health Care Finance and Policy provided four vendors with identical information on 2,528,624 discharges from Massachusetts acute care hospitals from October 1, 2004, through September 30, 2007. Vendors applied their risk-adjustment algorithms and provided predicted probabilities of in-hospital death for each discharge and for hospital-level observed and expected mortality rates. We compared the numbers and characteristics of discharges and hospitals included by each of the four methods. We also compared hospitals' standardized mortality ratios and classification of hospitals with mortality rates that were higher or lower than expected, according to each method. RESULTS: The proportions of discharges that were included by each method ranged from 28% to 95%, and the severity of patients' diagnoses varied widely. Because of their discharge-selection criteria, two methods calculated in-hospital mortality rates (4.0% and 5.9%) that were twice the state average (2.1%). Pairwise associations (Pearson correlation coefficients) of discharge-level predicted mortality probabilities ranged from 0.46 to 0.70. Hospital-performance categorizations varied substantially and were sometimes completely discordant. In 2006, a total of 12 of 28 hospitals that had higher-than-expected hospital-wide mortality when classified by one method had lower-than-expected mortality when classified by one or more of the other methods. CONCLUSIONS: Four common methods for calculating hospital-wide mortality produced substantially different results. This may have resulted from a lack of standardized national eligibility and exclusion criteria, different statistical methods, or fundamental flaws in the hypothesized association between hospital-wide mortality and quality of care.

"Evaluation and management of the renal mass. The evaluation and management of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has evolved in recent decades in response to the changing clinical presentation of the disease. Traditional teaching suggested that RCC usually presents with signs or symptoms. However, RCC discovered this way was usually locally advanced and often metastatic, requiring radical nephrectomy in most cases but often having a poor prognosis. As contemporary general medical practice began routinely using axial body imaging in the evaluation of many nonspecific abdominal complaints, today more than 70% of RCC cases identified are ""screen-detected"" as incidental findings having no attributable symptoms. This change has prompted a significant RCC stage migration over the past 20 years, with most kidney tumors seen in 2010 being smaller, organ-confined, and appropriate for nephron-sparing approaches with the anticipation of a favorable outcome. The approach to addressing patients with these incidentally detected, often localized, small renal masses raises different concerns than those for traditional patients presenting with symptomatic RCC. This article reviews the modern epidemiology of RCC, outlines the components of the evaluation of the incidental renal mass, details the current options of management, and discusses the long-term expectations for these patients.",cancer

"The use of zein and Shuanghuangbu for periodontal tissue engineering. AIM: Tissue engineering is a promising area with a broad range of applications in the fields of regenerative medicine and human health. The emergence of periodontal tissue engineering for clinical treatment of periodontal disease has opened a new therapeutic avenue. The choice of scaffold is crucial. This study was conducted to prepare zein scaffold and explore the suitability of zein and Shuanghuangbu for periodontal tissue engineering. METHODOLOGY: A zein scaffold was made using the solvent casting/particulate leaching method with sodium chloride (NaCl) particles as the porogen. The physical properties of the zein scaffold were evaluated by observing its shape and determining its pore structure and porosity. Cytotoxicity testing of the scaffold was carried out via in vitro cell culture experiments, including a liquid extraction experiment and the direct contact assay. Also, the Chinese medicine Shuanghuangbu, as a growth factor, was diluted by scaffold extract into different concentrations. This Shuanghuangbu-scaffold extract was then added to periodontal ligament cells (PDLCs) in order to determine its effect on cell proliferation. RESULTS: The zein scaffold displayed a sponge-like structure with a high porosity and sufficient thickness. The porosity and pore size of the zein scaffold can be controlled by changing the porogen particles dosage and size. The porosity was up to 64.1%-78.0%. The pores were well-distributed, interconnected, and porous. The toxicity of the zein scaffold was graded as 0-1. Furthermore, PDLCs displayed full stretching and vigorous growth under scanning electronic microscope (SEM). Shuanghuangbu-scaffold extract could reinforce proliferation activity of PDLCs compared to the control group, especially at 100 microg x mL(-1) (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: A zein scaffold with high porosity, open pore wall structure, and good biocompatibility is conducive to the growth of PDLCs. Zein could be used as scaffold to repair periodontal tissue defects. Also, Shuanghuangbu-scaffold extract can enhance the proliferation activity of PDLCs. Altogether, these findings provide the basis for in vivo testing on animals.",nocancer
The relationship between bcl-2 oncogene expression and clinicopathological criteria in various stages of cervical neoplasia in Egyptian women. PURPOSE: To assess the degree of bcl-2 expression in the various stages of cervical neoplasia in a sample population of Egyptian women and relate the findings to clinicopathological criteria of invasive cervical cancer. METHODS: Bcl-2 protein expression was assessed by immuno-histochemistry in 40 patients with cervical neoplasia (intraepithelial and invasive) in comparison to 20 patients with benign changes. Patients with invasive disease were followed up 2 years later and the outcome was correlated to the bcl-2 status at the time of diagnosis. RESULTS: Bcl-2 expression increased from 20% in normal cervical tissue to 42.9% in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade II then dropped to 33% in invasive disease. Bcl-2 was not expressed (0%) in patients with advanced disease stage and grade nor in patients with lympho-vascular space invasion. CONCLUSION: Bcl-2 expression is reduced along the spectrum from benign towards invasive disease of the cervix. The maximum expression found in CIN II may suggest increased potential of progression to CIN III.,cancer

"Fine needle aspiration of parapharyngeal space adult rhabdomyoma: a case report. BACKGROUND: Rhabdomyomas are rare benign tumors of striated muscle and include cardiac and extracardiac types. Extracardiac rhabdomyomas are divided in three subtypes (adult, fetal, genital). The adult type is usually found in the head and neck regions of elderly persons. Misinterpretations in initial diagnosis of adult rhabdomyomas on fine needle aspiration have been reported. CASE: A 64-year-old man presented with gurgling and difficulty swallowing for approximately 3 months. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a 5.8-cm solid mass located in the right parapharyngeal space. Fine needle aspiration smears were cellular, showing cohesive clusters of cells with scattered individual cells. Cells had abundant eosinophilic glassy cytoplasm, peripherally placed round nuclei, and prominent nucleoli. Many traversing vessels were noted, but cross-striations were not seen. The cell block demonstrated clusters of cells with abundant eosinophilic granular cytoplasm, some with clear and/or vacuolated cytoplasm, and possible cross-striations. Tumor cells were positive for desmin. The lesion closely resembled normal muscle tissue. Electron microscopy showed many cells containing actin and myosin filaments with Z-band material. CONCLUSION: Correct diagnosis can be achieved with a combination of awareness of the lesion, familiarity with the characteristic cytologic features, and application of appropriate immunohistochemistry markers. Classic electron microscopic findings can support the diagnosis.",cancer
"Recognition of military-specific physical activities with body-fixed sensors. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate an algorithm for recognizing military-specific, physically demanding activities using body-fixed sensors. To develop the algorithm, the first group of study participants (n = 15) wore body-fixed sensors capable of measuring acceleration, step frequency, and heart rate while completing six military-specific activities: walking, marching with backpack, lifting and lowering loads, lifting and carrying loads, digging, and running. The accuracy of the algorithm was tested in these isolated activities in a laboratory setting (n = 18) and in the context of daily military training routine (n = 24). The overall recognition rates during isolated activities and during daily military routine activities were 87.5% and 85.5%, respectively. We conclude that the algorithm adequately recognized six military-specific physical activities based on sensor data alone both in a laboratory setting and in the military training environment. By recognizing type of physical activities this objective method provides additional information on military-job descriptions.",nocancer
"Neural representations of relevant and irrelevant features in perceptual decision making. Although perceptual decision making activates a network of brain areas involved in sensory, integrative, and motor functions, circuit activity can clearly be modulated by factors beyond the stimulus. Of particular interest is to understand how the network is modulated by top-down factors such as attention. Here, we demonstrate in a motion coherence task that selective attention produces marked changes in the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response in a subset of regions within a human perceptual decision-making circuit. Specifically, when motion is attended, the BOLD response decreases with increasing motion coherence in many regions, including the motion-sensitive area MT+, the intraparietal sulcus, and the inferior frontal sulcus. However, when motion is ignored, the negative parametric response in a subset of this circuit becomes positive. Through both modeling and connectivity analyses, we demonstrate that this inversion both reflects a top-down influence and segregates attentional from accumulation regions, thereby permitting us to further delineate the contributions of different regions to the perceptual decision.",nocancer
"The Kore complex: on a woman's inheritance of her mother's failed Oedipus complex. The Greek myth of Kore/Persephone captures a particular psychopathology of women who are torn between a deadened and often asexual husband (Hades) and an ongoing close relationship with a caretaking mother (Demeter). Psychoanalytic work often reveals that these women live in the shadow of their mothers' failed oedipal complex. Their identificatory preoccupation with maternal object preservation disrupted or distorted their oedipal development, and ever since continues to serve as a defense against sexual strivings. Thus, these women are trapped in a Kore complex: as maiden caretakers, they remain attached to and torn between a ""grain mother"" and a grandfather transference object.",nocancer
"Management of primary rectal cancer by surgeons in Atlantic Canada: results of a regional survey. BACKGROUND: We sought to determine the current practice patterns of general surgeons in Atlantic Canada in the management of primary rectal cancer in relation to surgeon-specific variables. METHODS: We sent mail-out surveys to all practising general surgeons (n = 183) in Atlantic Canada to determine screening preferences, preoperative assessment, the use of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy, surgical therapy for rectal cancer and surgeon demographics. We analyzed the responses using chi(2) tests. RESULTS: The response rate was 98 (54%) after 2 mail-outs; there were 82 (49%) eligible responses. Surgeons in practice for 21 years or more were more likely than those with fewer than 21 years of practice to order preoperative ultrasonography of the liver and were less likely to order preoperative computed tomography. Endorectal ultrasonography was ordered routinely by 23% of surgeons, whereas 71% of surgeons would order it if time and resources were available. Surgeons who were not certified by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada were significantly more likely than those who were certified to use neoadjuvant therapy in all patients with rectal cancer (43% v. 12%; p = 0.031). Surgeons who performed more than 10 rectal cancer surgeries per year were significantly more likely than those who performed 10 or fewer surgeries per year to use neoadjuvant treatment for T3 tumours (94% v. 61%; p = 0.007). Surgeons with medical or radiation oncology services in their communities were significantly more likely than those without such services to recommend neoadjuvant treatment in T3 rectal tumours and rectal tumours with pathologic lymph nodes. CONCLUSION: We found significant variation in the management of rectal cancer depending on surgeon-specific variables. The implications of these differences on the outcomes of patients with rectal cancer are unknown.",cancer
"Merkel cell carcinoma. Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare, highly aggressive neuroendocrine cutaneous neoplasm with a variable clinical presentation. Histologically, it is a predominantly dermal-based lesion composed of monotonous small round cells with scanty cytoplasm, often difficult to differentiate from small round cell tumors, metastatic small cell carcinoma, blastic hematologic malignancies, and melanoma. The malignant cells express both epithelial and neuroendocrine immunohistochemical markers, a unique feature that helps differentiate this neoplasm from other entities. The pathogenesis of Merkel cell carcinoma has remained a mystery despite its association with various chromosomal abnormalities and with growth signaling and apoptotic pathways. The discovery of the Merkel cell polyomavirus suggests another clue to its pathogenesis. This virus integrates into band 3p14 and promotes carcinogenesis by altering the activity of tumor suppressor and cell cycle regulatory proteins. This discovery of the Merkel cell polyomavirus may greatly enhance our understanding of this rare aggressive neoplasm and allow further advancements in treatment.",cancer
"The novel quinolone CHM-1 induces DNA damage and inhibits DNA repair gene expressions in a human osterogenic sarcoma cell line. 20-Fluoro-6,7-methylenedioxy-2-phenyl-4-quino-lone (CHM-1) has been reported to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in many types of cancer cells. However, there is no available information to show CHM-1 affecting DNA damage and expression of associated repair genes. Herein, we investigated whether or not CHM-1 induced DNA damage and affected DNA repair gene expression in U-2 OS human osterogenic sarcoma cells. The comet assay showed that incubation of U-2 OS cells with 0, 0.75, 1.5, 3 and 6 muM of CHM-1 led to a longer DNA migration smear (comet tail). DNA gel electrophoresis showed that 3 muM of CHM-1 for 24 and 48 h treatment induced DNA fragmentation in U-2 OS cells. Real-time PCR analysis showed that treatment with 3 muM of CHM-1 for 24 h reduced the mRNA expression levels of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR), breast cancer 1, early onset (BRCA1), 14-3-3sigma (14-3-3sigma), DNA-dependent serine/threonine protein kinase (DNA-PK) and O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) genes in a time-dependent manner. Taken together, the results indicate that CHM-1 caused DNA damage and reduced DNA repair genes in U-2 OS cells, which may be the mechanism for CHM-1-inhibited cell growth and induction of apoptosis.",cancer
"Greater pressor reactivity in women with pre-eclampsia is not related to specific psychological or emotional stressors. To investigate whether emotional or psychosocial factors could be significantly related with the development of pre-eclampsia, 15 pregnant women with early diagnosis of pre-eclampsia and 15 normotensive pregnant controls of comparable age (23-37 yr.), gestational age (10-37 wk.), parity (70% primiparous), amount of instruction, and marital status underwent a blood pressure monitoring during a specific psychological assessment based on a semistructured interview followed by the administration of three different questionnaires: the Symptom Checklist 90-Revised, the Perceived Stress Questionnaire-Recent, and the Questionnaire about Social Relationships. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were measured at 2-min. intervals by an automatic device both during the interview and the questionnaires' administration. Both systolic and diastolic responses were significantly increased in both groups during the interview (deltaSBP = 15 vs. 10%; deltaDBP=28 vs. 15.8%), whereas no differences were observed in blood pressure while answering questionnaires. Conversely, differences in questionnaire responses between groups were not statistically significant. Present results confirm a greater pressor reactivity in these women with pre-eclampsia but does not specifically support that this was related to psychological or emotional stress.",nocancer
"Cerebrospinal fluid cytologic findings of a pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma: a case report. BACKGROUND: Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) is a rare astrocytic neoplasm with a relatively favorable prognosis. Characteristic histologic features include pleomorphic tumor cells and lipidized cells expressing glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), corresponding to a World Health Organization grade 2 tumor. Cytologic features of PXA have been rarely described, only in squash specimens, but only 2 cases are reported in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CASE: A 45-year-old woman complained of severe headaches and diplopia. Computed tomography of the central nervous system revealed a supracallous periventricular tumor mass suggestive of either a lymphoma or a metastatic carcinoma. CSF revealed 18 cells/mm3 and contained numerous tumor cells highly pleomorphic in size and shape. Some atypical cells of moderate size were closely packed with well-defined cytoplasmic limits and a vacuolated appearance, suggesting an epithelial proliferation. On immunocytochemistry atypical cells were positive for GFAP, S100 protein and synaptophysin but were negative for pancytokeratins and epithelial membrane antigen. A primitive glial proliferation was found, and paraffin-embedded tumor tissue obtained by biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of anaplastic PXA. CONCLUSION: Observation of PXA in CSF might cause some differential diagnosis problems, especially with a metastatic epithelial malignancy. We present a case of anaplastic PXA with an unusual periventricular location and its cytologic features in CSF.",cancer
"The metabolic syndrome and associated risk factors in an urban industrial male population in South India. BACKGROUND: The metabolic syndrome is characterized by clustering of risk factors, which predisposes subjects to increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Objectives of this study were to estimate prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and determine the association of risk factors with the metabolic syndrome in an urban industrial male population in Chennai, India. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey for male employees working in an industrial unit. The survey included questionnaire for risk factors, anthropometric and blood pressure measurements. Blood samples were collected for the fasting plasma glucose, serum cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides. The metabolic syndrome was defined using International Diabetes Federation (IDF) and American Heart Association (AHA)/National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) criteria. RESULTS: The total numbers of male subjects included in the study were 1077. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome was 41.3% and 51.4% using IDF and AHA/NHLBI criteria respectively. Risk factors were age above 35 years, family history of diabetes and body mass index (BMI) above 23.9 kg/m2. The consumption of more than three servings of fruits and vegetables was protective. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome was very high in select industrial population in south India. Higher BMI and low intake of fruits and vegetables are modifiable by life style modification.

"The treatment of open femoral fractures with bone loss. The results of the treatment of 31 open femoral fractures (29 patients) with significant bone loss in a single trauma unit were reviewed. A protocol of early soft-tissue and bony debridement was followed by skeletal stabilisation using a locked intramedullary nail or a dynamic condylar plate for diaphyseal and metaphyseal fractures respectively. Soft-tissue closure was obtained within 48 hours then followed, if required, by elective bone grafting with or without exchange nailing. The mean time to union was 51 weeks (20 to 156). The time to union and functional outcome were largely dependent upon the location and extent of the bone loss. It was achieved more rapidly in fractures with wedge defects than in those with segmental bone loss. Fractures with metaphyseal defects healed more rapidly than those of comparable size in the diaphysis. Complications were more common in fractures with greater bone loss, and included stiffness of the knee, malunion and limb-length discrepancy. Based on our findings, we have produced an algorithm for the treatment of these injuries. We conclude that satisfactory results can be achieved in most femoral fractures with bone loss using initial debridement and skeletal stabilisation to maintain length, with further procedures as required.",nocancer
"TH17 is involved in the remarkable regression of metastatic malignant melanoma to topical diphencyprone. The authors provide an update on a previously reported patient with in-transit metastatic melanoma of the scalp treated with topical diphencyprone (DPCP). Molecular studies implicate the thymus-derived TH17 lymphocyte subset in a remarkable immunotherapeutic regression. The authors performed RT-PCR of total RNA from paraffin-embedded tissue before and after treatment with DPCP. Before treatment with DPCP, the authors found elevated expression of IL 17C/D/E/F; after treatment there was no detectable expression. Conversely, increased expression of PLZF/CD27 and CTLA4 was seen after treatment with no expression before treatment. No expression of IL17A/B, CD7, RORgTand FoxP3 were before or after treatment. Conclusions are limited to only the time samples were obtained. Remarkable regression of an in-transit metastatic melanoma treated with the immunomodulatory agent DPCP showed gain and loss of gene expression of the TH17 pathway. Further study of this pathway from NK to NK-T to TH7 and TH1 cells both with and without accessory or dendritic cells will improve understanding of contact sensitizers as topical immunomodulators.",cancer
"A new approach for identifying patients with ovarian epithelial neoplasms based on high-resolution mass spectrometry. We investigated the serum profiles of patients with ovarian neoplasm using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) to obtain serum ""fingerprints"" for use in identifying patients with these neoplasms. We used HPLC-HRMS to analyze serum samples from patients with ovarian neoplasms and control subjects. Serum samples from 145 patients were analyzed, including 85 with ovarian epithelial neoplasms. We also compared the results of this serum-fingerprinting approach with the results of the CA-125 test and imaging. Fingerprinting successfully permitted the separation of control patients and patients with ovarian neoplasms. The sensitivity and specificity of the test were between 96% and 100%. When the results of this test were concordant with the results of the CA-125 test, 99% of serum samples were correctly classified as being from a patient with an ovarian neoplasm or with no ovarian neoplasm. We found that a metabolite of molecular weight 472 is the main metabolite in the separation of patients with ovarian neoplasms from control subjects. HPLC-HRMS serum profiling could become a screening test for ovarian neoplasms.",cancer

"Environmental cues to UV radiation and personal sun protection in outdoor winter recreation. OBJECTIVE: To predict the prevalence of UV radiation (hereinafter, UV) at North American ski resorts using temporal, seasonal, altitudinal, and meteorological factors and associate UV with a set of adult sun protection behaviors. DESIGN: Ultraviolet radiation observations and cross-sectional survey of adults on sun protection were collected. SETTING: Data were collected at 32 high-altitude ski areas located in western North America from 2001 through 2003. PARTICIPANTS: The sample consisted of 3937 adult skiers or snowboarders. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measurements of direct, reflected, and diffuse UV were performed at 487 measurement points using handheld meters and combined with self-reported and observed sun protection assessed for adults interviewed on chairlifts. RESULTS: The strongest predictors of UV were temporal proximity to noon, deviation from winter solstice, and clear skies. By contrast, altitude and latitude had more modest associations with UV and temperature had a small positive relationship with UV. Guest sun safety was inconsistently associated with UV: UV was positively related to adults wearing more sunscreen, reapplying it after 2 hours, and wearing protective eyewear, but fewer adults exhibited many of the other sun protection behaviors, such as wearing hats and protective clothing or using lip balm, on days when UV was elevated. Guests took more sun safety precautions on clear-sky days but took steps to maintain body warmth on inclement days. CONCLUSIONS: In future sun safety promotions, adults should be encouraged to wear sunscreen on cloudy days because UV is still high and conditions can change rapidly. They need reminders to rely more on season and time of day when judging UV and the need for sun safety.",cancer
"Complex thoracic aortic disease: single-stage procedure with the frozen elephant trunk technique. OBJECTIVE: Extensive thoracic aortic aneurysms represent a challenging pathology in cardiac surgery. The frozen elephant trunk procedure, combining conventional surgery with endovascular techniques, allows single-stage treatment for such pathology. Here we present our surgical technique and results with the single-stage frozen elephant trunk procedure. METHODS: Between January 2007 and December 2009, 67 patients were treated with the frozen elephant trunk procedure in our institution. Mean age was 61 +/- 11 years. Indications for surgery included chronic aneurysm (n = 22, 32.8%), acute type A dissection (n = 4, 6.0%), acute type B dissection (n = 2, 3.0%), chronic type A dissection (n = 30, 44.8%), and chronic type B dissection (n = 9, 13.4%). Thirty-six patients (53.7%) had undergone 38 previous cardiac or aortic operations. Thirty-two associated aortic and cardiac operations were performed. Brain protection was achieved by means of antegrade selective cerebral perfusion and moderate hypothermia (26 degrees C) in all cases. RESULTS: In-hospital mortality was 13.4%. Postoperatively, permanent neurologic dysfunction (coma) occurred in 5 cases (7.5%), paraplegia in 2 (3.2%), and paraparesis in 3 (4.9%). Follow-up was 100% complete, with mean duration of 11.1 +/- 8.4 months. The 1- and 2-year survivals were 76.7 +/- 5.6% and 70.3 +/- 8.0%, respectively. Ten patients (14.9%) required endovascular completion 2.3 +/- 3.1 months after the first procedure, with 100% technical and procedural success. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the conventional elephant trunk technique, the frozen elephant trunk technique offers a potentially curative single-stage procedure for patients with extensive thoracic aortic disease, with encouraging short-term and midterm results.",nocancer
"Fetal lung interstitial tumor (FLIT): A proposed newly recognized lung tumor of infancy to be differentiated from cystic pleuropulmonary blastoma and other developmental pulmonary lesions. The differential diagnosis of congenital lung lesions includes a variety of pulmonary malformations, and uncommon or rare neoplasms such as the pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) and congenital peribronchial myofibroblastic tumor (CPMT). Although most of the congenital lesions have a predominantly cystic appearance, the exceptions of a more solid process are the type 3 congenital cystic adenomatoid or pulmonary airway malformation (CCAM-CPAM) and the CPMT. The clinical and pathologic features of a unique solid or mixed solid/cystic lung mass composed of immature interstitial mesenchyme in association with irregular airspace-like structures mimicking abnormal incompletely developed lung are presented in this report of 10 infants (7 males, 3 females) whose tumor-like lesions were detected in the prenatal period to 3 months of age (median, 1-day old). A lobectomy was done in all 10 infants and 1 infant received adjuvant chemotherapy. One of the surgical resections occurred as an ex utero, antenatal procedure because of fetal ascites. There have been no reported recurrences in those patients with greater than 12 months of follow-up ranging from 15 to 182 months (9 cases). Because of the morphologic resemblance of this mass-like lesion to fetal lung at 20 to 24 weeks gestation (as though any further pulmonary development was arrested in these localized lesions), we are proposing the designation of fetal lung interstitial tumor (FLIT) whose pathogenetic relationship, if any, to type 1 (cystic) pleuropulmonary blastoma remains uncertain to date.",cancer
"The tragedy of Haiti: A reason for major cultural change. With the recent earthquake in Haiti, it is most befitting to discuss my travel to this poor country more than a decade ago. The travel was a mission that examined the health status and the education of residents in the capital city of Port- au-Prince. After close observation, it seems that the health and educational status then, today and since the tragedy, is basically the same with less, if any, possible improvement. This article examines the present state of health and education of the Haitian people, in the wake of its recent tragedy. Although, the people were very poor in economics, they were rich in culture and exhibited polite mannerisms that made me feel overly welcomed in their homes and to the few resources they had to offer It appears that in past years, this country was and still is noted as the poorest country in the Americas, however, it is not the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. On many occasions, it has been publicly and widely reported that Haiti experienced political violence throughout its history. The government of Haiti is known for corruption. It also appears that an earthquake the magnitude of 7.0 would not have easily destroyed so many of its infrastructure and people, if in the past, the surrounding countries, including the United States, would have assisted in providing this country with safer and stronger foundations for buildings and especially shelter for the residents and the many visitors who were the true victims. Despite the repressive regime, Haiti's location, history and culture were very attractive to tourists in the 1960s and 1970s. Visitors returned home with memorable artifacts that included cave paintings, wood statues (figurines) and hand made jewelry.",nocancer
"The horror of being deaf and in prison. Being Deaf and in prison is a horror. The main fear of prison inmates, whether Deaf or hearing, is that they will be raped, killed, or subjected to other forms of violence. Such fears are based in reality. The recent overcrowding of jails and prisons has increased these problems significantly. A major reason for this situation is the blatant violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act by most jails and prisons in the United States. This includes the failure to provide interpreting services for necessary activities and facilities such as religious services, educational programs, vocational training, faith-based prisons, and mental health treatment for addiction. The author discusses other problems faced by inmates who are Deaf and offers suggestions for correcting injustices faced by those who are Deaf in American jails and prisons.",nocancer

"The impact of 68Ga-DOTATOC positron emission tomography/computed tomography on the multimodal management of patients with neuroendocrine tumors. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of 68Ga-DOTATOC positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) on the multimodal management of neuroendocrine tumors (NET). BACKGROUND: Establishment of the extent and progression of NET are necessary to decide which treatment option to choose. However, morphological imaging with CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often inadequate in identifying the primary tumor and/or in detecting small metastatic lesions. METHODS: In total, 52 patients (27 women and 25 men) with histologically proven NET could be included in the protocol of comparison between 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT and CT and/or MRI. The examinations were performed in terms of tumor staging and, in some instances, also of primary tumor site identification to evaluate the patient's eligibility for treatment. Each patient presented with either CT and/or MRI performed elsewhere and consecutively underwent 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT in our institution. RESULTS: In all 52 patients, 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT demonstrated pathologically increased uptake for at least 1 tumor site, yielding a sensitivity of 100% on a patient basis. In 3 of 4 patients with unknown primary tumor site, 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT visualized the primary tumor region (jejunum, ileum, and pancreas, respectively) not identified on CT and/or MRI. 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT detected additional hepatic and/or extrahepatic metastases in 22 of the 33 patients diagnosed with hepatic metastases on CT and/or MRI. Of the 15 patients evaluated for liver transplantation, we omitted 7 (46.6%) from further screening because of evidence of metastatic deposits not seen by conventional imaging. Overall, 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT altered our treatment decision based on CT and/or MRI alone, in 31 (59.6%) of the 52 patients. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT proved clearly superior to CT and/or MRI for detection and staging of NET. More important, 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT impacted our treatment decision in more than every second patient.",cancer
"Minimally invasive video-assisted thyroidectomy versus conventional thyroidectomy: a cost-effective analysis. OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost of minimally invasive video-assisted thyroidectomy (MIVAT) with conventional thyroidectomy. STUDY DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness study and chart review. SETTING: Academic university hospital. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Pediatric and adult patients referred to the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery for suspicious thyroid nodules, goiters, or known carcinomas. A tertiary care hospital's billing department was queried for all hemithyroidectomies and total thyroidectomies completed by the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery between January 5, 2006, and November 1, 2007. The charges, including surgery, hospital, pathology, and anesthesia, for minimally invasive video-assisted thyroidectomy (MIVAT) and traditional or minimally invasive open thyroidectomies meeting MIVAT inclusion criteria were then reviewed retrospectively and compared statistically. RESULTS: A total of 185 thyroidectomies were performed, 50.3 percent of which met criteria for MIVAT. Length of stay (days) was significantly shorter for patients undergoing MIVAT hemithyroidectomy (mean difference -0.8; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] -1.08 to -0.52) and not significantly different between groups for total thyroidectomy (mean difference 0.1; 95% CI -0.36 to 0.56). Mean anesthesia cost (U.S.$) was similar between groups for hemi- and total thyroidectomies. MIVAT mean pathology cost was significantly less than open thyroidectomy for hemithyroidectomy (mean difference -89.9; 95% CI -179.01 to -0.79) and approached significance for total thyroidectomy. There was no significant difference in hospital cost and total cost for hemithyroidectomy and total thyroidectomy. CONCLUSION: In a group of matched cohorts, the cost of MIVAT appears to be equal to that of open thyroidectomy.",nocancer
"Prehospital rapid sequence intubation improves functional outcome for patients with severe traumatic brain injury: a randomized controlled trial. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether paramedic rapid sequence intubation in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) improves neurologic outcomes at 6 months compared with intubation in the hospital. BACKGROUND: Severe TBI is associated with a high rate of mortality and long-term morbidity. Comatose patients with TBI routinely undergo endo-tracheal intubation to protect the airway, prevent hypoxia, and control ventilation. In many places, paramedics perform intubation prior to hospital arrival. However, it is unknown whether this approach improves outcomes. METHODS: In a prospective, randomized, controlled trial, we assigned adults with severe TBI in an urban setting to either prehospital rapid sequence intubation by paramedics or transport to a hospital emergency department for intubation by physicians. The primary outcome measure was the median extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSe) score at 6 months. Secondary end-points were favorable versus unfavorable outcome at 6 months, length of intensive care and hospital stay, and survival to hospital discharge. RESULTS: A total of 312 patients with severe TBI were randomly assigned to paramedic rapid sequence intubation or hospital intubation. The success rate for paramedic intubation was 97%. At 6 months, the median GOSe score was 5 (interquartile range, 1-6) in patients intubated by paramedics compared with 3 (interquartile range, 1-6) in the patients intubated at hospital (P = 0.28).The proportion of patients with favorable outcome (GOSe, 5-8) was 80 of 157 patients (51%) in the paramedic intubation group compared with 56 of 142 patients (39%) in the hospital intubation group (risk ratio, 1.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.64; P = 0.046). There were no differences in intensive care or hospital length of stay, or in survival to hospital discharge. CONCLUSIONS: In adults with severe TBI, prehospital rapid sequence intubation by paramedics increases the rate of favorable neurologic outcome at 6 months compared with intubation in the hospital.",nocancer
"Impact of prolonged fraction delivery times simulating IMRT on cultured nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell killing. PURPOSE: To determine the impact of prolonged fraction delivery times (FDTs) simulating intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) on cultured nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cell killing. METHODS AND MATERIAL: Cultured NPC cell lines CNE1 and CNE2 were used in this study. The biological effectiveness of fractionated irradiation protocols simulating conventional external beam radiotherapy and IMRT (FDT of 15, 36, and 50 minutes) was estimated with standard colony assay, and the differences in cell surviving fractions after irradiation with different protocols were tested by use of the paired t test. The impact degree of prolonged FDTs (from 8 to 50 minutes) on cell killing was also assessed by the dose-modifying factors, which were estimated by comparing the effectiveness of intermittently delivered 2 Gy with that of continuously delivered 1.5 to 2 Gy. RESULTS: The cell surviving fractions of both CNE1 and CNE2 after fractionated irradiation simulating IMRT were higher than those simulating conventional external beam radiotherapy (p < 0.05). The dose-modifying factors for a fraction dose of 2 Gy increased from 1.05 to 1.18 for CNE1 and from 1.05 to 1.11 for CNE2 with the FDT being prolonged from 15 to 50 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the prolonged FDTs simulating IMRT significantly decreased the cell killing in both CNE1 and CNE2 cell lines, and these negative effects increased with the FDT being prolonged from 15 to 50 minutes. These effects, if confirmed by in vivo and clinical studies, need to be considered in designing IMRT treatments for NPC.",cancer
"Thrombolysis in very elderly people: controlled comparison of SITS International Stroke Thrombolysis Registry and Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive. OBJECTIVE: To assess effect of age on response to alteplase in acute ischaemic stroke. DESIGN: Adjusted controlled comparison of outcomes between non-randomised patients who did or did not undergo thrombolysis. Analysis used Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test and proportional odds logistic regression analysis. SETTING: Collaboration between International Stroke Thrombolysis Registry (SITS-ISTR) and Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive (VISTA). PARTICIPANTS: 23 334 patients from SITS-ISTR (December 2002 to November 2009) who underwent thrombolysis and 6166 from VISTA neuroprotection trials (1998-2007) who did not undergo thrombolysis (as controls). Of the 29 500 patients (3472 aged >80 (""elderly,"" mean 84.6), data on 272 patients were missing for baseline National Institutes of Health stroke severity score, leaving 29 228 patients for analysis adjusted for age and baseline severity. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Functional outcomes at 90 days measured by score on modified Rankin scale. RESULTS: Median severity at baseline was the same for patients who underwent thrombolysis and controls (median baseline stroke scale score: 12 for each group, P=0.14; n=29 228). The distribution of scores on the modified Rankin scale was better among all thrombolysis patients than controls (odds ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.5 to 1.7; Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel P<0.001). The association occurred independently among patients aged </=80 (1.6, 1.5 to 1.7; P<0.001; n=25 789) and in those aged >80 (1.4, 1.3 to 1.6; P<0.001; n=3439). Odds ratios were consistent across all 10 year age ranges above 30, and benefit was significant from age 41 to 90; dichotomised outcomes (score on modified Rankin scale 0-1 v 2-6; 0-2 v 3-6; and 6 (death) v rest) were consistent with the results of the ordinal analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Outcome in patients with acute ischaemic stroke is significantly better in those who undergo thrombolysis compared with those who do not. Increasing age is associated with poorer outcome but the association between thrombolysis treatment and improved outcome is maintained in very elderly people. Age alone should not be a barrier to treatment.",nocancer

"Obtusilactone A and (-)-sesamin induce apoptosis in human lung cancer cells by inhibiting mitochondrial Lon protease and activating DNA damage checkpoints. Several compounds from Cinnamomum kotoense show anticancer activities. However, the detailed mechanisms of most compounds from C. kotoense remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the anticancer activity of obtusilactone A (OA) and (-)-sesamin in lung cancer. Our results show that human Lon is upregulated in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, and downregulation of Lon triggers caspase-3 mediated apoptosis. Through enzyme-based screening, we identified two small-molecule compounds, obtusilactone A (OA) and (-)-sesamin from C. kotoense, as potent Lon protease inhibitors. Obtusilactone A and (-)-sesamin interact with Ser855 and Lys898 residues in the active site of the Lon protease according to molecular docking analysis. Thus, we suggest that cancer cytotoxicity of the compounds is partly due to the inhibitory effects on Lon protease. In addition, the compounds are able to cause DNA double-strand breaks and activate checkpoints. Treatment with OA and (-)-sesamin induced p53-independent DNA damage responses in NSCLC cells, including G(1) /S checkpoint activation and apoptosis, as evidenced by phosphorylation of checkpoint proteins (H2AX, Nbs1, and Chk2), caspase-3 cleavage, and sub-G(1) accumulation. In conclusion, OA and (-)-sesamin act as both inhibitors of human mitochondrial Lon protease and DNA damage agents to activate the DNA damage checkpoints as well induce apoptosis in NSCLC cells. These dual functions open a bright avenue to develop more selective chemotherapy agents to overcome chemoresistance and sensitize cancer cells to other chemotherapeutics.",cancer
"A physiologic and pharmacological basis for implementation of incretin hormones in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Progressive deterioration of beta-cell function is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Together with increasing insulin resistance in peripheral tissues (in both the liver and the skeletal muscle), the inability of pancreatic insulin secretion to manage fasting and postprandial glucose levels results in hyperglycemia. Currently available oral antidiabetes agents improve glycemic parameters, but no single drug addresses the numerous pathophysiologic defects known to contribute to hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 DM. Dysregulation in the incretin system is another component of the pathophysiologic processes that lead to DM. Agents used to correct defects in the incretin system, such as glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors, offer the potential to restore glucose-dependent insulin secretion and improve beta-cell function. Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists also promote weight loss and provide beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk factors. A new approach that promotes the selection of pharmacotherapy for the treatment of patients with DM, with the goal of slowing or reversing the natural history of the disease, may be in order. Clinicians can select agents to address specific pathophysiologic defects to improve glycemia, with the hope of preventing the development of complications.",nocancer
"Geriatric nephrology. The great increase in the number of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) can be explained by a number of reasons. Elderly patients present typical and peculiar clinical features, and nephrologists have to consider the frequent clinical complications related to old age, such as malnutrition and cachexia, cognitive impairment and physical dependence with walking disability and depression. All of these factors have led to the birth of geriatric nephrology. Geriatric nephrology needs to take into account the high prevalence of diabetes and vascular disease in the elderly, which is related to a poor prognosis, mainly related to cerebrocardiovascular mortality. Best everyday clinical practice should include an accurate evaluation of patients, including quality of life, to select the best therapeutic approach for each individual case. A careful and reasonable use of drugs in the elderly is also of importance.",nocancer
"Urban transitions: on urban resilience and human-dominated ecosystems. Urbanization is a global multidimensional process paired with increasing uncertainty due to climate change, migration of people, and changes in the capacity to sustain ecosystem services. This article lays a foundation for discussing transitions in urban governance, which enable cities to navigate change, build capacity to withstand shocks, and use experimentation and innovation in face of uncertainty. Using the three concrete case cities--New Orleans, Cape Town, and Phoenix--the article analyzes thresholds and cross-scale interactions, and expands the scale at which urban resilience has been discussed by integrating the idea from geography that cities form part of ""system of cities"" (i.e., they cannot be seen as single entities). Based on this, the article argues that urban governance need to harness social networks of urban innovation to sustain ecosystem services, while nurturing discourses that situate the city as part of regional ecosystems. The article broadens the discussion on urban resilience while challenging resilience theory when addressing human-dominated ecosystems. Practical examples of harnessing urban innovation are presented, paired with an agenda for research and policy.",nocancer

"Expression of cytokines in cervical stroma in patients with high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia after treatment with intralesional interferon alpha-2b. Conservative treatment with interferons (IFNs) has the advantage of preserving reproductive capacity in patients with grade 2 or 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). The objective of this work was to study patients with high-grade CIN treated with intralesional IFN alpha-2b and to analyze the expression of Th1, Th2 and Th3 cytokines in cervical stroma. We observed that patients with a satisfactory response (60%) to treatment with IFN alpha-2b expressed more Th1 (IFN-gamma TNF-alpha, IL-2) cytokines, with a significant reduction in the viral load of high-risk human papillomavirus (p = 0.0313).

"C-2 anterior plate-screw fixation: a quantitative anatomical and morphometric evaluation. OBJECTIVES: Discectomy and inter-vertebral body fusion combined with the anterior plate-screw fixa tion is the common procedure in cervical spine surgery. But the anterior plate-screw fixation of the C2 spine has been the uncommon surgical procedure. In this study, we analyze the anatomy of the C2 body relevant to C2 anterior plate-screw fixation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighty-six dried C2 spines were evaluated directly for this study. Measurements were made on the C2 body width and midsagittal anteroposterior (AP) depth and the anteroposterior parasagittal depth 5 mm lateral to midline on the inferior endplates, in addition to on the middle body. Measurements also were made of anteroposterior parasagittal vertebral depth with both medial and lateral inclination of 10 degrees, with respect to the parasagittal plane of the vertebral body. RESULTS: The ideal maximum screw length and trajectory was found to be AP medial parasagittal depth of inferior surface of the C2 body [Right: 13.7 +/- 1.4 mm (11.0-17.9), Left: 13.6 +/- 1.5 mm (10.7-17.8)]. CONCLUSIONS: We report the measurements of the vertebral body of the C2. We think these measurements provide guidelines for operating on the anterior C2 spine, and enhance the confidence interval for the surgeon (Tab. 3, Fig. 1, Ref. 24).",nocancer

"Surveillance of screening-detected cancers (colon and rectum, breast, and cervix) - United States, 2004-2006. PROBLEM/CONDITION: Population-based screening is conducted to detect diseases or other conditions in persons before symptoms appear; effective screening leads to early detection and treatment, thereby reducing disease-associated morbidity and mortality. Based on systematic reviews of the evidence of the benefits and harms and assessments of the net benefit of screening, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends population-based screening for colon and rectum cancer, female breast cancer, and uterine cervix cancer. Few publications have used national data to examine the stage at diagnosis of these screening-amenable cancers. REPORTING PERIOD COVERED: 2004-2006. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEMS: Data were obtained from cancer registries affiliated with CDC's National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) and the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. Combined data from the NPCR and SEER programs provide the best source of information on national population-based cancer incidence. Data on cancer screening were obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. This report provides stage-specific cancer incidence rates and screening prevalence by demographic characteristics and U.S. state. RESULTS: Approximately half of colorectal and cervical cancer cases and one third of breast cancer cases were diagnosed at a late stage of disease. Incidence rates of late-stage cancer differed by age, race/ethnicity, and state. Incidence rates of late-stage colorectal cancer increased with age and were highest among black men and women. Incidence rates of late-stage breast cancer were highest among women aged 60-79 years and black women. Incidence rates of late-stage cervical cancer were highest among women aged 50-79 years and Hispanic women. The percentage of persons who received recommended screening differed by age, race/ethnicity, and state. INTERPRETATION: Differences in late-stage cancer incidence rates might be explained partially by differences in screening use. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: The findings in this report emphasize the need for ongoing population-based surveillance and reporting to monitor late-stage cancer incidence trends. Screening can identify colorectal, cervical, and breast cancers in earlier and more treatable stages of disease. Multiple factors, including individual characteristics and health behaviors as well as provider and clinical systems factors, might account for why certain populations are underscreened. Cancer control planners, including comprehensive cancer-control programs, can use late-stage cancer incidence and screening prevalence data to identify populations that would benefit from interventions to increase screening utilization and to monitor performance of early detection programs.",cancer
"Phenotypic heterogeneity among tumorigenic melanoma cells from patients that is reversible and not hierarchically organized. We investigated whether melanoma is hierarchically organized into phenotypically distinct subpopulations of tumorigenic and nontumorigenic cells or whether most melanoma cells retain tumorigenic capacity, irrespective of their phenotype. We found 28% of single melanoma cells obtained directly from patients formed tumors in NOD/SCID IL2Rgamma(null) mice. All stage II, III, and IV melanomas obtained directly from patients had common tumorigenic cells. All tumorigenic cells appeared to have unlimited tumorigenic capacity on serial transplantation. We were unable to find any large subpopulation of melanoma cells that lacked tumorigenic potential. None of 22 heterogeneously expressed markers, including CD271 and ABCB5, enriched tumorigenic cells. Some melanomas metastasized in mice, irrespective of whether they arose from CD271(-) or CD271(+) cells. Many markers appeared to be reversibly expressed by tumorigenic melanoma cells.",cancer

"Lack of HER2 overexpression and amplification in small intestinal adenocarcinoma. HER2 overexpression and amplification have been studied as a therapeutic and prognostic target in a number of human cancers, including esophageal, gastric, and colorectal adenocarcinomas. However, HER2 status has not been well investigated in primary small intestinal adenocarcinoma, probably because of its rarity. In this study, we conducted immunohistochemical analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for HER2 on 49 primary nonampullar small intestinal adenocarcinomas. The results showed a complete lack of HER2 protein expression in 47 cases (96%) by immunohistochemical analysis. Only 2 cases (4%) showed a 1+ staining pattern. No tumors exhibited 2+ or 3+ HER2 immunoreactivity. By FISH, none of the tumors, including those with 1+ HER2 immunoreactivity, exhibited HER2 gene amplification. These observations demonstrate that HER2 protein overexpression and gene amplification are infrequent events, if they occur at all, in small intestinal adenocarcinoma. Thus, routine immunohistochemical and/or FISH testing for HER2 for potential targeted anti-HER2 therapy may not be beneficial for patients with primary small intestinal adenocarcinoma.",cancer

"Paget's disease of the vulva detected in vulvar and vaginal brushing smears: a case report. BACKGROUND; Vulvar Paget's disease comprises only 1-8% of malignant vulvar tumors. It is associated with an underlying carcinoma in 20-30% of cases. Clinically, it manifests as erythematous areas with hyperkeratotic plaques, accompanied by pruritus. Histologically, it is characterized by large, pale cells with mucicarmine-positive cytoplasm, isolated or in aggregates, in the epidermis. CASE: A 75-year-old woman presented with erythematous plaques covering the entire vulvar, vaginal and perianal area and pruritus. Smears were taken from all 3 sites and stained with Papanicolaou stain. Additionally, biopsies were taken from the vulva, vagina and outer borders of the lesion and were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and also for periodic acid-Schiff stain, CK7, CEA, S-100 and CK20. The cytologic examination revealed numerous round to columnar, moderately enlarged atypical cells, dispersed or in loose groups, with abundant clear cytoplasm, vesicular nuclei and prominent nucleoli. The histologic findings confirmed the cytologic diagnosis. No indication of an underlying adenocarcinoma was found. CONCLUSION: Although the histologic examination of a vulvar lesion is necessary in order to confirm the diagnosis of vulvar Paget's disease and rule out the possibility of an underlying invasive adenocarcinoma, the cytologic examination of vulvar smears is useful for alerting the clinician to the possibility of vulvar Paget's disease.",cancer
"Psychometric properties of the Coping Response Inventory with Brazilian adolescents. To analyze the psychometric properties of the Coping Response Inventory-Youth Form (CRI-Y) and its applicability, 426 Brazilian adolescents (43.3% boys, 56.7% girls), ages 12 to 18 years (M = 16.5, SD = 1.6), completed the authorized Brazilian/Portuguese version of the 1993 original. Analysis showed higher use of Approach coping and Emotional Discharge by the girls. The inventory showed internal consistency reliability was similar to that of the original scale. A two-factor structure reflecting Approach and Avoidance coping was found; however, the distribution of loadings of specific coping scales on this two-factor structure did not fit the original Moos model. The criterion validity analyzed by the use of the Youth Self-Report showed significant positive relation between the Avoidance dimension and Psychopathological symptoms for boys and girls. Data were discussed with respect to coping theory, assessment, and cultural influences.",nocancer
"Fundus image fusion in EYEPLAN software: an evaluation of a novel technique for ocular melanoma radiation treatment planning. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate a novel approach for treatment planning using digital fundus image fusion in EYEPLAN for proton beam radiation therapy (PBRT) planning for ocular melanoma. The authors used a prototype version of EYEPLAN software, which allows for digital registration of high-resolution fundus photographs. The authors examined the improvement in tumor localization by replanning with the addition of fundus photo superimposition in patients with macular area tumors. METHODS: The new version of EYEPLAN (v3.05) software allows for the registration of fundus photographs as a background image. This is then used in conjunction with clinical examination, tantalum marker clips, surgeon's mapping, and ultrasound to draw the tumor contour accurately. In order to determine if the fundus image superimposition helps in tumor delineation and treatment planning, the authors identified 79 patients with choroidal melanoma in the macular location that were treated with PBRT. All patients were treated to a dose of 56 GyE in four fractions. The authors reviewed and replanned all 79 macular melanoma cases with superimposition of pretreatment and post-treatment fundus imaging in the new EYEPLAN software. For patients with no local failure, the authors analyzed whether fundus photograph fusion accurately depicted and confirmed tumor volumes as outlined in the original treatment plan. For patients with local failure, the authors determined whether the addition of the fundus photograph might have benefited in terms of more accurate tumor volume delineation. RESULTS: The mean follow-up of patients was 33.6 +/- 23 months. Tumor growth was seen in six eyes of the 79 macular lesions. All six patients were marginal failures or tumor miss in the region of dose fall-off, including one patient with both in-field recurrence as well as marginal. Among the six recurrences, three were managed by enucleation and one underwent retreatment with proton therapy. Three patients developed distant metastasis and all three patients have since died. The replanning of six patients with their original fundus photograph superimposed showed that in four cases, the treatment field adequately covered the tumor volume. In the other two patients, the overlaid fundus photographs indicated the area of marginal miss. The replanning with the fundus photograph showed improved tumor coverage in these two macular lesions. For the remaining patients without local failure, replanning with fundus photograph superimposition confirmed the tumor volume as drawn in the original treatment plan. CONCLUSIONS: Local control was excellent in patients receiving 56 GyE of PBRT for uveal melanomas in the macular region, which traditionally can be more difficult to control. Posterior lesions are better defined with the additional use of fundus image since they can be difficult to mark surgically. In one-third of treatment failing patients, the superposition of the fundus photograph would have clearly allowed improved localization of tumor. The current practice standard is to use the superimposition of the fundus photograph in addition to the surgeon's clinical and clip mapping of the tumor and ultrasound measurement to draw the tumor volume.",cancer
"Health consequences of Chernobyl: the New York Academy of Sciences publishes an antidote to the nuclear establishment's pseudo-science. In February 2010, the New York Academy of Sciences published the most complete and up-to-date collection of evidence, from independent, scientific sources all over the world, on the health and environmental consequences of the Chernobyl accident. For 24 years, through a high-level, internationally coordinated cover-up of the world's most serious industrial accident, the nuclear lobby has deprived the world of a unique and critically important source of scientific information. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), mouthpiece of the nuclear establishment, has coordinated the cover-up through the dissemination and imposition of crude pseudo-science. Regrettably, the World Health Organization, a U.N. agency on which the world's people rely for guidance, is subordinate to the IAEA in matters of radiation and health, has participated in the cover-up, and stands accused of non-assistance to populations in danger. The new book on Chernobyl makes available huge amounts of evidence from independent studies undertaken in the affected countries, unique and valuable data that have been ignored by the international health establishment. This comprehensive account of the full dimensions of the catastrophe reveals the shameful inadequacy of current international assistance to the affected populations. It also demonstrates, once more, that future energy options cannot include nuclear power.",cancer
"E-cadherin accumulation within the lymphovascular embolus of inflammatory breast cancer is due to altered trafficking. E-Cadherin functions as a tumor suppressor in some invasive breast carcinomas and metastasis is promoted when its expression is lost. It has been observed, however, that in one of the most aggressive human breast cancers, inflammatory breast cancer (IBC), E-cadherin is overexpressed and this accounts for the formation of the lymphovascular embolus, a structure efficient at metastasis and resistant to chemotherapy through unknown cytoprotective mechanisms. Studies using a human xenograft model of IBC, MARY-X, indicate that the mechanism of E-cadherin overexpression is not transcriptional but related to altered protein trafficking. By real-time RT-PCR, E-cadherin transcript levels in MARY-X were 3- to 11-fold less than in other E-cadherin positive human breast carcinoma lines but the protein levels were 5- to 10-fold greater. In addition, several smaller E-cadherin protein fragments, e.g. 95 kDa, were present. To explain these observations, it was hypothesized that there may be altered protein trafficking. A real-time RT-PCR screen of candidate molecules generally known to regulate protein trafficking was conducted. The screen revealed 3.5- to 7-fold increased ExoC5 level and 10 to 20 fold decreased HRS and RAB7 levels, which was confirmed in human microdissected lymphovascular emboli. Since these alterations may only be correlative with E-cadherin overexpression, one of the molecules, Rab7, was selectively knocked down in MCF-7 cells. An increase in the full length 120 kDa E-cadherin and the de novo appearance of the 95 KD band were observed. These findings suggest that it is the altered E-cadherin trafficking that contributes to its oncogenic rather than suppressive role in IBC.",cancer
"FOXO/4E-BP signaling in Drosophila muscles regulates organism-wide proteostasis during aging. The progressive loss of muscle strength during aging is a common degenerative event of unclear pathogenesis. Although muscle functional decline precedes age-related changes in other tissues, its contribution to systemic aging is unknown. Here, we show that muscle aging is characterized in Drosophila by the progressive accumulation of protein aggregates that associate with impaired muscle function. The transcription factor FOXO and its target 4E-BP remove damaged proteins at least in part via the autophagy/lysosome system, whereas foxo mutants have dysfunctional proteostasis. Both FOXO and 4E-BP delay muscle functional decay and extend life span. Moreover, FOXO/4E-BP signaling in muscles decreases feeding behavior and the release of insulin from producing cells, which in turn delays the age-related accumulation of protein aggregates in other tissues. These findings reveal an organism-wide regulation of proteostasis in response to muscle aging and a key role of FOXO/4E-BP signaling in the coordination of organismal and tissue aging.",nocancer
"Expression patterns of fetal hemoglobin in sickle cell erythrocytes are both patient- and treatment-specific during childhood. BACKGROUND: Treatment-associated fetal hemoglobin (HbF) expression patterns in children with sickle cell disease (SCD) have not been fully described. The objective of this study was to compare HbF expression profiles (HbF and F-cells) in the peripheral blood of pediatric SCD patients receiving hydroxyurea (HU), chronic transfusions (Tx) or no chronic therapy (Ctrl). PROCEDURE: Peripheral blood samples were collected from SCD patients between 1 month and 21 years of age and immunostained with anti-HbF and anti-HbA antibodies. Erythrocytes containing HbF (F-cells) were enumerated with this dual staining method. HbF was measured using chromatography (HPLC). RESULTS: Blood from 44 Ctrl patients </= 4 years of age was compared with that from older children (50 Ctrl, 17 HU, 17 Tx). Among the older children, the percentage of both HbF and F-cells in the Tx group was significantly decreased compared to the control (HbF 5.4 +/- 4.2% vs. 11.0 +/- 7.2%, P = 0.003; F-cells 30.2 +/- 16.3% vs. 43.8 +/- 20.4%, P = 0.0071). While the distribution of F-cells was significantly increased in the HU group (56.3 +/- 17.1% vs. 43.8 +/- 20.4%, P = 0.016), the increase in HbF was less robust (14.7 +/- 6.4% vs. 11.0 +/- 7.2%, P = 0.051). Positive correlations of HbF and F-cell distributions were noted in all groups (P < 0.0001 for all groups). In serial samples from individual patients, relatively static patterns of HbF and F-cell distribution were noted. CONCLUSION: Pediatric SCD patients possess distinct patterns of HbF switching and silencing in peripheral blood erythrocytes. Thereafter, erythrocyte HbF expression level and distribution are maintained with both patient- and treatment-specific patterns that may be useful for predicting the need or response to HbF-modulating therapy.",nocancer
"Spleen metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma: report of a case with diagnosis by fine needle aspiration cytology. BACKGROUND: Metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to various organs is frequently seen. The lungs, regional lymph nodes, kidney, bone marrow and adrenals are relatively common sites of metastasis. Spleen metastasis from HCC is unusual, and only a few cases have been retorted; none have been diagnosed by fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). CASE: A 54-year-old male visited our institute with chief complaints of abdominal pain and mild ascites. Multifocal HCC and an isolated splenic mass lesion were detected on abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography. FNAC was performed under ultrasound guidance from the liver and spleen mass lesions. Cytologic examination of the aspirates showed classical features of hepatocellular carcinoma and similar tumor cells with hepatocytic differentiation in the spleen. Immunocytochemistry for hepatocyte paraffin-1 confirmed the splenic metastasis of HCC. CONCLUSION: Splenic metastasis from HCC diagnosed by FNAC is an exceptional situation; herein we confirm the rarity of this pathology and the efficacy of FNAC as a safe and valuable diagnostic tool for evaluating splenic lesions in oncologic patients.",cancer
"Aspiration cytomorphology of fetal adenocarcinoma of the lung. Fetal adenocarcinoma (FA) of the lung is an exceedingly rare malignancy. Many patients with the well-differentiated form are relatively young and with the high-grade variant are older. We describe the cases of 4 women with FA examined by fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Aspirates were moderately cellular with malignant, mostly aggregated cells. Glands and acini were present. The columnar neoplastic epithelial cells had homogeneous round nuclei with fine chromatin, smooth membranes, and indistinct nucleoli. With the rapid Romanowsky stain, subnuclear vacuoles were evident in some tumor cells; at times, this was associated with a focal extracellular tigroid pattern. Morule formation was present in the 3 specimens. Immunochemically, all tumors manifested epithelial and neuroendocrine differentiation. Cytomorphologic attributes included the following: (1) distinct subnuclear vacuoles, sometimes with an associated tigroid picture; (2) small, uniform, round nuclei; (3) morules; and (4) neuroendocrine differentiation in glandular epithelial cells.",cancer
"Validation of the MDRF-Indian Diabetes Risk Score (IDRS) in another south Indian population through the Boloor Diabetes Study (BDS). OBJECTIVE: To validate the MDRF-Indian Diabetes Risk Score (IDRS) in a south Indian population in coastal Karnataka. METHODS: The study was conducted at Boloor locality in Mangalore on adults aged 20 years or more. The study group comprised 551 participants (68.9% response rate). The OGTT was performed using 75 gms of glucose. The MDRF-IDRS was calculated using age, family history of diabetes, physical activity and waist measurement. ROC curves were constructed to identify the optimum value (> or = 60%) of IDRS for determining diabetes as diagnosed using WHO consulting group criteria. RESULTS: We found that 71 of the study individuals were known diabetic subjects (KD) while 45 subjects were diagnosed to have newly diagnosed diabetes (NDD). An IDRS score of > or =60 had the best sensitivity (62.2%) and specificity of (73.7%) for detecting undiagnosed diabetes in this community. CONCLUSION: Our study confirms and validates the MDRF-IDRS as being a valid simple and reliable screening tool to identify undiagnosed diabetes in the community. The MDRF-IDRS score > or =60 had the highest sensitivity and specificity to identify undiagnosed diabetes.",nocancer
"Predicting the risk and diminishing the consequences of anastomotic leakage after anterior resection for rectal cancer. INTRODUCTION: Anastomotic leakage is one of the most serious early complications of any intestinal anastomosis. The morbidity and mortality are high and patients may be at increased risk of cancer recurrence. In colorectal surgery the risks are particularly high following low anterior resection. Factors which increase and decrease the risks are discussed. METHODS: A review of the main published risk factors for anastomotic leakage after anterior resection for rectal cancer together with the authors personal experience is reported. A review of a recent large randomized trial of a defunctioning stoma versus no stoma is outlined. RESULTS: The main factor influencing anastomotic leakage is the height of the anastomosis above the anal verge with the lower the anastomosis the higher the risk. All anastomoses within 7 cm of the anal verge are at increased risk which includes all patients who have had a total mesorectal excision. Neoadjuvant therapy (in particular long course radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy) increases the risk. Male sex, older age, smoking, alcohol in excess, short course radiotherapy, obesity, general fitness, immunosuppression have been reported in some series as increasing the risk. A temporary diverting stoma decreases the consequences of leakage and reduces the need for emergency re-operation. Anastomotic leakage is associated with an increased postoperative death rate, reoperative rates, need for a permanent stoma and possibly an increase in local recurrence and decreased cancer specific and overall survival. CONCLUSION: Anastomotic leakage is a serious early complication following surgery for rectal cancer. The height of the anastomosis and neoadjuvant therapy are the main predictors of an increased risk. A diverting stoma diminishes the consequences of risk and reduces the need for emergency re-operation.",cancer
"Tai chi as a balance improvement exercise for older adults: a systematic review. PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review was to identify exercise parameters and the most common outcome measures used in tai chi (TC) research. METHODS: Ovid Medline and PubMed were used to identify longitudinal studies published from January 2000 to July 2007 written in English with the key words tai chi, tai ji, tai chi quan, tai ji quan, balance, falls, and falling. Qualifying studies had subjects aged 60 years or older. RESULTS: In all 19 qualified prospective studies, older vigorous and likely transitional frail individuals seemed to benefit more from TC than did older frail individuals. The most commonly used TC parameters were Yang's style, with 12 or fewer forms, durations of 12 weeks or longer, frequencies of twice a week or more, and session lengths of at least 45 minutes. The most common outcome measures observed were a combination of 2 to 5 of the following 10 measures (from most to least common): fear of falling, single-leg stance, posturography, rate of falling, flexibility, walking velocity, Berg Balance Scale, Timed up and Go, Functional Reach, and ankle and knee joint strength and range of motion. Improvements were reported in almost all of these measures. CONCLUSIONS: This review indicates that TC may be an economic and effective exercise program for improving balance and balance confidence in older adults.",nocancer
"Laparoscopic resection of colorectal liver metastases: surgical and long-term oncologic outcome. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the immediate and long-term outcome after laparoscopic resection of colorectal liver metastases and difference between observed and predicted [Fong's and Basingstoke Predictive Index (BPI) scores] survivals. BACKGROUND: : Laparoscopic liver resection has been reported safe and feasible and improves postoperative course. The oncologic outcomes after resection of colorectal metastases are poorly reported. METHODS: Between August 1998 and January 2010, 122 patients underwent laparoscopic resection for colorectal liver metastases during 135 procedures at Rikshospitalet. Patients undergoing surgery between August 1998 and June 2009 were included in research analysis. The patients had median Fong's and BPI's scores of 2 (0-5) and 7 (0-23), respectively. Mainstream analysis of hospital data was done on intent-to-treat basis. Intraoperative incidents and postoperative complications were analyzed according to the Satava and Clavien-Dindo classifications. Median follow-up was 24 (0-100) months. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-one liver resections were performed in 107 patients during 118 procedures: 117 nonanatomic and 34 anatomic liver resections. There were 5 conversions to laparotomy (4.2%). The resection margin was free of tumor tissue in 141 (93.4%) of 151 specimens, and the distance between the resection margin and tumor tissue was median 6 (0-40) mm. Intraoperative incidents occurred in 14 cases (11.9%), including 5 (4.2%), 8 (6.8%), and 1 (0.8%) cases of grades I, II, and III, respectively. Postoperative complications were observed in 16 cases (14.3%), including 2, 3, 7, 3, 0, and 1 cases of grades I, II, IIIa, IIIb, IV, and V, respectively. During follow-up, 21 patients received repeat liver resection of recurrences (11 by laparoscopy and 10 by laparotomy). The 5-year overall survival rates were 51% as laparoscopically completed cases and 47% as intent-to-treat. The observed actuarial survival values exceeded the values expected by Fong's and BPI's score, with 10.2% and 6.7% as laparoscopically completed cases and with 3.8% and 2.4% as intent-to-treat, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic resection is a favorable alternative to open liver resection for patients with colorectal liver metastases. The observed actuarial survival values after laparoscopic resection surpass the values expected by major scoring systems.",cancer
"Increased serum alkaline phosphatase as a predictor of long-term mortality after stroke. BACKGROUND: Although the critical role of alkaline phosphatase in bone mineralization is clearly understood, the potentially adverse effect of high alkaline phosphatase levels on the cardiovascular system was only recently suggested. In this study, we hypothesized that increased levels of serum alkaline phosphatase may be associated with poor outcome after stroke in terms of mortality. METHODS: We prospectively included patients with acute stroke admitted consecutively to our hospital, from October 2002 to September 2008. A total of 2,029 patients were selected for the analyses. In the analyses of mortality, the patients were divided by baseline measurements into quintiles of alkaline phosphatase levels (<57, 57-69, 70-81, 82-97, >97 IU/L). RESULTS: In the Cox proportional hazard models, compared with the first alkaline phosphatase quintile, adjusted hazard ratios of the third, fourth, and fifth quintiles for all-cause death were 1.67 (95% confidence interval 1.12-2.49), 1.79 (1.20-2.67), and 2.83 (1.95-4.10). When we divided the patients into ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, the association was also significant for both subtypes of stroke. In terms of vascular death, compared to the first alkaline phosphatase quintile, the adjusted hazard ratios of the fourth and fifth quintiles of alkaline phosphatase were 1.81 (95% confidence interval 1.14-2.86) and 2.78 (1.87-4.15). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that increased serum levels of alkaline phosphatase are an independent predictor of all-cause and vascular death after either ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke.",nocancer
"A model for judgments of work values and job satisfaction. First, a discussion is presented of some previous research results on the relation of a person's assessment of the importance (""value"") of an object and his or her attitude toward that object, in particular on the relation of work values with job satisfaction. Then, a model is formulated and simulated to explain how both types of judgments are generated. In Phase 1, the elements of the mental representation of the respective attitude object are aggregated by two composition rules to an overall satisfaction and an overall importance judgment, respectively. In addition, possible dissonance of high importance and low satisfaction is reduced by a coping function.",nocancer
"Sugar transporters for intercellular exchange and nutrition of pathogens. Sugar efflux transporters are essential for the maintenance of animal blood glucose levels, plant nectar production, and plant seed and pollen development. Despite broad biological importance, the identity of sugar efflux transporters has remained elusive. Using optical glucose sensors, we identified a new class of sugar transporters, named SWEETs, and show that at least six out of seventeen Arabidopsis, two out of over twenty rice and two out of seven homologues in Caenorhabditis elegans, and the single copy human protein, mediate glucose transport. Arabidopsis SWEET8 is essential for pollen viability, and the rice homologues SWEET11 and SWEET14 are specifically exploited by bacterial pathogens for virulence by means of direct binding of a bacterial effector to the SWEET promoter. Bacterial symbionts and fungal and bacterial pathogens induce the expression of different SWEET genes, indicating that the sugar efflux function of SWEET transporters is probably targeted by pathogens and symbionts for nutritional gain. The metazoan homologues may be involved in sugar efflux from intestinal, liver, epididymis and mammary cells.",nocancer

"Personality, acculturation, and psychosocial adjustment of Chinese international students in Germany. The effect of personality traits and acculturation variables on crosscultural adjustment were investigated in 139 Chinese students in Germany (52% girls; M age = 25.3 yr., SD = 2.9). Participants were surveyed by house visits to their dormitories. Several scales were administered: (a) Big Five Inventory; (b) Vancouver Index of Acculturation; (c) sociocultural adjustment, general and academic; and (d) psychological adjustment, i.e., depression, self-esteem, and life satisfaction. Results showed that Neuroticism and Openness were two shared predictors of sociocultural adjustment. Agreeableness and mainstream acculturation were only related to general adjustment, while Conscientiousness was only related to academic adjustment. All facets of psychological adjustment were related to Neuroticism and Consciousness, while positive components (self-esteem and life satisfaction) were also related to Extraversion and Openness. No influence of heritage acculturation was found. The findings are discussed in light of measurement issues and the shared and unique individual predictors of the different facets of adjustment.",nocancer

"Bidirectional association between depression and type 2 diabetes mellitus in women. BACKGROUND: Although it has been hypothesized that the diabetes-depression relation is bidirectional, few studies have addressed this hypothesis in a prospective setting. METHODS: A total of 65 381 women aged 50 to 75 years in 1996 were observed until 2006. Clinical depression was defined as having diagnosed depression or using antidepressants, and depressed mood was defined as having clinical depression or severe depressive symptoms, ie, a 5-item Mental Health Index (MHI-5) score of 52 or less. Self-reported type 2 diabetes mellitus was confirmed by means of a supplementary questionnaire validated by medical record review. RESULTS: During 10 years of follow-up (531 097 person-years), 2844 incident cases of type 2 diabetes mellitus were documented. Compared with referents (MHI-5 score of 86-100) who had the best depressive symptom scores, participants with increased severity of symptoms (MHI-5 scores of 76-85 or 53-75, or depressed mood) showed a monotonic elevated risk of developing type 2 diabetes (P for trend = .002 in the multivariable-adjusted model). The relative risk for individuals with depressed mood was 1.17 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.30) after adjustment for various covariates, and participants using antidepressants were at a particularly higher relative risk (1.25; 95% CI, 1.10-1.41). In a parallel analysis, 7415 cases of incident clinical depression were documented (474 722 person-years). Compared with nondiabetic subjects, those with diabetes had a relative risk (95% CI) of developing clinical depression after controlling for all covariates of 1.29 (1.18-1.40), and it was 1.25 (1.09-1.42), 1.24 (1.09-1.41), and 1.53 (1.26-1.85) in diabetic subjects without medications, with oral hypoglycemic agents, and with insulin therapy, respectively. These associations remained significant after adjustment for diabetes-related comorbidities.

"Testing for the presence of positive-outcome bias in peer review: a randomized controlled trial. BACKGROUND: If positive-outcome bias exists, it threatens the integrity of evidence-based medicine. METHODS: We sought to determine whether positive-outcome bias is present during peer review by testing whether peer reviewers would (1) recommend publication of a ""positive"" version of a fabricated manuscript over an otherwise identical ""no-difference"" version, (2) identify more purposefully placed errors in the no-difference version, and (3) rate the ""Methods"" section in the positive version more highly than the identical ""Methods"" section in the no-difference version. Two versions of a well-designed randomized controlled trial that differed only in the direction of the finding of the principal study end point were submitted for peer review to 2 journals in 2008-2009. Of 238 reviewers for The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery and Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research randomly allocated to review either a positive or a no-difference version of the manuscript, 210 returned reviews. RESULTS: Reviewers were more likely to recommend the positive version of the test manuscript for publication than the no-difference version (97.3% vs 80.0%, P < .001). Reviewers detected more errors in the no-difference version than in the positive version (0.85 vs 0.41, P < .001). Reviewers awarded higher methods scores to the positive manuscript than to the no-difference manuscript (8.24 vs 7.53, P = .005), although the ""Methods"" sections in the 2 versions were identical.

"Four-limb compartment syndrome associated with the systemic capillary leak syndrome. Systemic capillary leak syndrome, or the Clarkson syndrome, is an extremely rare condition in which increased capillary permeability results in a massive shift of fluid into the extravascular space. This is followed rapidly by hypotensive shock, haemoconcentration, and, potentially, substantial oedema of the limbs resulting in an acute compartment syndrome. It is important for orthopaedic surgeons to be aware of this syndrome as our medical colleagues, who initially care for these patients, are less familiar with the diagnosis and the need for emergency management of the associated compartment syndrome should it develop. There have been fewer than 100 cases of this entity reported. This case report is the first to describe the subsequent development of a compartment syndrome in all four limbs. Clinical vigilance and continuous monitoring of intracompartmental pressure is necessary in these patients in order to help reduce limb-threatening complications.",nocancer
"Population-based survival estimates for childhood cancer in Australia during the period 1997-2006. BACKGROUND: This study provides the latest available relative survival data for Australian childhood cancer patients. METHODS: Data from the population-based Australian Paediatric Cancer Registry were used to describe relative survival outcomes using the period method for 11,903 children diagnosed with cancer between 1983 and 2006 and prevalent at any time between 1997 and 2006. RESULTS: The overall relative survival was 90.4% after 1 year, 79.5% after 5 years and 74.7% after 20 years. Where information onstage at diagnosis was available (lymphomas, neuroblastoma, renal tumours and rhabdomyosarcomas), survival was significantly poorer for more-advanced stage. Survival was lower among infants compared with other children for those diagnosed with leukaemia, tumours of the central nervous system and renal tumours but higher for neuroblastoma. Recent improvements in overall childhood cancer survival over time are mainly because of improvements among leukaemia patients. CONCLUSION: The high and improving survival prognosis for children diagnosed with cancer in Australia is consistent with various international estimates. However, a 5-year survival estimate of 79% still means that many children who are diagnosed with cancer will die within 5 years, whereas others have long-term health morbidities and complications associated with their treatments. It is hoped that continued developments in treatment protocols will result in further improvements in survival.",cancer
"Video-rate molecular imaging in vivo with stimulated Raman scattering. Optical imaging in vivo with molecular specificity is important in biomedicine because of its high spatial resolution and sensitivity compared with magnetic resonance imaging. Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy allows highly sensitive optical imaging based on vibrational spectroscopy without adding toxic or perturbative labels. However, SRS imaging in living animals and humans has not been feasible because light cannot be collected through thick tissues, and motion-blur arises from slow imaging based on backscattered light. In this work, we enable in vivo SRS imaging by substantially enhancing the collection of the backscattered signal and increasing the imaging speed by three orders of magnitude to video rate. This approach allows label-free in vivo imaging of water, lipid, and protein in skin and mapping of penetration pathways of topically applied drugs in mice and humans.",nocancer
"Clinical and dermoscopic progression of subungual hematomas. Subungual pigmentation is a very common problem and can result from pigments derived from melanin, blood, or fungi. Subungual hematoma usually appears as a reddish to reddish-black pigment depending on the age of the bleed, and it can easily be misdiagnosed as melanoma. In this study, we tried to show the clinical and dermoscopic progression of subungual hematomas. Thirty-six patients with the history of first nail trauma within the last 7 days were included in the study. All the patients were evaluated three times with 3-week intervals. The distance from proximal nail fold to the hematoma was measured by a paper ruler. The area and the largest diameter of the hematoma were calculated by using the Molescore software. At the beginning, the most common dermoscopic finding was the homogen area (n = 36, 100%) followed by small globules (n = 32, 88.9%), large globules (n = 29, 80.6%), and streaks (n = 19, 52.8%). At week 3, the most common dermoscopic finding was the homogen area (n = 36, 100%) followed by large globules (n = 27, 75%), small globules (n = 19, 52.8%), and streaks (n = 11, 30.6%). At the sixth week, the most common dermoscopic finding was homogen area (n = 36, 100%) followed by large globules (n = 16, 44.4%), small globules (n = 7, 19.4%), and streaks (n = 2, 5.6%). The diameter and the area of the hematoma shrunk gradually between weeks 0, 3, and 6 (P < 0.001). Dermoscopy is a very useful tool in the evaluation and differential diagnosis of subungual hematomas. Determination that the pigmented plague grows out distally and shrinks gradually will support the diagnosis of subungual hematoma.",cancer
"Effect of pharyngeal packing during nasal surgery on postoperative nausea and vomiting. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of pharyngeal packing in reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) after nasal surgery by taking into consideration the surgery types. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: A tertiary referral center. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: After the study was approved by the local ethics committee, this study was conducted in the Otorhinolaryngology clinic with the collaboration of the Anesthesiology clinic. The development of PONV within 24 hours after surgery was evaluated in patients who were applied a pharyngeal pack (Group 1) or not (Group 2) during nasal surgery. RESULTS: There were 104 adult patients for routine nasal surgery included in the current study, yielding 100 (group 1, n = 50; group 2, n = 50) evaluable subjects. No significant difference was found in the incidence of PONV between the two groups at two (P = 0.41), four (P = 0.54), eight (P = 0.51), and 24 hours. According to surgery type, the incidence of PONV after two hours was 71 percent in septorhinoplasty, 68 percent in endoscopic sinus surgery, and 50 percent in septoplasty; after four hours it was 59 percent in septorhinoplasty, 53 percent in endoscopic sinus surgery, and 37 percent in septoplasty; and after eight hours it was 35 percent in septorhinoplasty, 39 percent in endoscopic sinus surgery, and 21 percent in septoplasty. PONV was not seen at 24 hours. Compared to the septoplasty group for which pharyngeal packing was used, significantly lower rates of PONV at four and eight hours were found in the septoplasty group in which pharyngeal packing was not used (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Pharyngeal packing in nasal surgery has no impact on PONV.",nocancer
"HSP60, oxidative stress parameters and cardiometabolic risk markers in hypertensive and normotensive Slovak females. BACKGROUND: The aim of our study was to analyse the relationships between hypertension, HSP60, oxidative stress, lipid profile and cardiometabolic risk in 126 females with arterial hypertension (AHW) and 39 normotensive females (AH-). RESULTS: Females with AH+ were significantly older and more frequently suffered from ischemic heart disease, angina pectoris, prior MI, abdominal obesity, obesity, metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus. On the other hand, normotensive females smoked significantly more often. Plasma levels of HSP60 were similar in both AH+ and AH- groups. However, hypertensive females exhibited almost two times lower values of oxidative glutation and lower levels of carbonyl protein, but significantly higher levels of homocysteine. In normotensive females, the total glutathione was the only parameter predicting females with the plasma level of HSP60 = 60 ng/ml. The independent predictors in hypertensive females were angina pectoris, triglycerides and the mean arterial pressure (MAP). MAP had also a borderline significance in normotensive females suggesting an association between HSP60 and blood pressure. MAP formed a J shaped curve with HSP60. CONCLUSION: Results suggest the association of blood pressure and heart shock protein 60 Kda in form of the J curve (Tab. 11, Fig. 3, Ref. 29).",nocancer

She draws on Loewald's work as she discusses how change in her own internal relationship with her father was part of a lifelong emotional reorganization of Oedipal relations. She describes a process of mutual change whereby her and her patients' unconscious growth each stimulated the other. She suggests that the analyst's own emotional growth is a vital, not an incidental, part of psychoanalysis, as it brings new life to the work for patients as well as analysts themselves.",nocancer

"Metastatic gestational trophoblastic neoplasia complicated by tumor lysis syndrome, heart failure, and thyrotoxicosis: a case report. BACKGROUND: Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is an extremely rare complication of solid tumors and is more frequently observed in patients with hematologic malignancies. This report describes a novel approach to the management of a rare case of TLS in metastatic gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN). CASE: A 17-year-old female presented 8 weeks postpartum with severe anemia, thyrotoxicosis, and elevated serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG). Imaging studies confirmed metastatic GTN to the lungs. The patient developed grade 4 TLS after the first cycle of etoposide, methotrexate, dactinomycin, cyclophosphamide, and vincristine (EMA-CO). She did not respond to standard treatment of aggressive hydration and allupurinol and continued to be in renal failure with elevated uric acid. A single dose of recombinant urate oxidase, rasburicase, rendered the uric acid level undetectable in 3 days and completely reversed the renal failure, avoiding hemodialysis. Three more cycles of EMA-CO were then administered. Subsequently, the patient developed congestive heart failure and was switched to single-agent actinomycin-D. Beta-hCG became negative after 5 cycles, and her ejection fraction returned to baseline. CONCLUSION: This is a rare case of TLS in the setting of metastatic GTN. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of utilizing rasburicase for the management of TLS in GTN.",cancer
"Unique cytomorphologic features of Brenner tumor of the ovary: a case report. BACKGROUND: Breast carcinomas are very well known to metastasize to the ovary. Hence, it is justified to think of an ovarian mass, in a known case of breast carcinoma, as a metastasis from the same. CASE: A 70-year-old woman underwent ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) from a unilateral ovarian mass to confirm its nature. Cytosmears were highly cellular and showed cohesive clusters of small to intermediate-sized cells with bland nuclear chromatin and moderate cytoplasm in a background of mucinous material. A unique feature was the presence of microcystic spaces, around which the cells were arranged in an orderly fashion. Only occasional nuclear grooves were seen; however, they were helpful in suggesting the diagnosis of Brenner tumor. The subsequent histopathology specimen confirmed the diagnosis, with an excellent cytohistologic correlation. CONCLUSION: There is very limited experience with the FNAC findings of this tumor, and it is usually a diagnostic dilemma for the cytopathologist. This case highlights certain unique cytomorphologic features that may aid in diagnosis on cytology alone.",cancer
"Aberrant frontal and temporal complex network structure in schizophrenia: a graph theoretical analysis. Brain regions are not independent. They are interconnected by white matter tracts, together forming one integrative complex network. The topology of this network is crucial for efficient information integration between brain regions. Here, we demonstrate that schizophrenia involves an aberrant topology of the structural infrastructure of the brain network. Using graph theoretical analysis, complex structural brain networks of 40 schizophrenia patients and 40 human healthy controls were examined. Diffusion tensor imaging was used to reconstruct the white matter connections of the brain network, with the strength of the connections defined as the level of myelination of the tracts as measured through means of magnetization transfer ratio magnetic resonance imaging. Patients displayed a preserved overall small-world network organization, but focusing on specific brain regions and their capacity to communicate with other regions of the brain revealed significantly longer node-specific path lengths (higher L) of frontal and temporal regions, especially of bilateral inferior/superior frontal cortex and temporal pole regions. These findings suggest that schizophrenia impacts global network connectivity of frontal and temporal brain regions. Furthermore, frontal hubs of patients showed a significant reduction of betweenness centrality, suggesting a less central hub role of these regions in the overall network structure. Together, our findings suggest that schizophrenia patients have a less strongly globally integrated structural brain network with a reduced central role for key frontal hubs, resulting in a limited structural capacity to integrate information across brain regions.",nocancer
"Surface applicator calibration and commissioning of an electronic brachytherapy system for nonmelanoma skin cancer treatment. PURPOSE: The Xoft Axxent x-ray source has been used for treating nonmelanoma skin cancer since the surface applicators became clinically available in 2009. The authors report comprehensive calibration procedures for the electronic brachytherapy (eBx) system with the surface applicators. METHODS: The Xoft miniature tube (model S700) generates 50 kVp low-energy x rays. The new surface applicators are available in four sizes of 10, 20, 35, and 50 mm in diameter. The authors' tests include measurements of dose rate, air-gap factor, output stability, depth dose verification, beam flatness and symmetry, and treatment planning with patient specific cutout factors. The TG-61 in-air method was used as a guideline for acquiring nominal dose-rate output at the skin surface. A soft x-ray parallel-plate chamber (PTW T34013) and electrometer was used for the output commissioning. GafChromic EBT films were used for testing the properties of the treatment fields with the skin applicators. Solid water slabs were used to verify the depth dose and cutout factors. Patients with basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma were treated with eBx using a calibrated Xoft system with the low-energy x-ray source and the skin applicators. RESULTS: The average nominal dose-rate output at the skin surface for the 35 mm applicator is 1.35 Gy/min with +/- 5% variation for 16 sources. The dose-rate output and stability (within +/- 5% variation) were also measured for the remaining three applicators. For the same source, the output variation is within 2%. The effective source-surface distance was calculated based on the air-gap measurements for four applicator sizes. The field flatness and symmetry are well within 5%. Percentage depth dose in water was provided by factory measurements and can be verified using solid water slabs. Treatment duration was calculated based on the nominal dose rate, the prescription fraction size, the depth dose percentage, and the cutout factor. The output factor needs to be measured for each case with varying shapes of cutouts. CONCLUSIONS: Together with TG-61, the authors' methodology provides comprehensive calibration procedures for medical physicists for using the Xoft eBx system and skin applicators for nonmelanoma skin cancer treatments.",cancer
"Antitumour and cytogenetic effects of modified steroidal derivatives of propenoic acid: in vivo/in vitro studies. BACKGROUND: Modified steroidal derivatives (PK11-PK14) of p-bis(2-chloroethyl)aminophenyl propenate (PK15) were used to study their antitumour activity on Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) and their effect on sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and human lymphocyte proliferation kinetics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: LLC was tested in this study. C57BL mice were used for in vivo chemotherapy evaluation and the antitumour activity was assessed. Lymphocyte cultures were used to study the genotoxic effect in vitro. RESULTS: PK15 and PK11 were the most effective against LLC, causing significant inhibition of tumour growth. PK11 and PK15 induced significant increase in SCE rates. A correlation was observed between the cytogenetic effect and the antitumour effectiveness. CONCLUSION: The order of the antitumour effectiveness of PK11-PK15 resembled the order of the cytogenetic damage induced by the same compounds in vitro.",cancer
"Association of troponin T detected with a highly sensitive assay and cardiac structure and mortality risk in the general population. CONTEXT: Detectable levels of cardiac troponin T (cTnT) are strongly associated with structural heart disease and increased risk of death and adverse cardiovascular events; however, cTnT is rarely detectable in the general population using standard assays. OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence and determinants of detectable cTnT in the population using a new highly sensitive assay and to assess whether cTnT levels measured with the new assay associate with pathological cardiac phenotypes and subsequent mortality. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cardiac troponin T levels were measured using both the standard and the highly sensitive assays in 3546 individuals aged 30 to 65 years enrolled between 2000 and 2002 in the Dallas Heart Study, a multiethnic, population-based cohort study. Mortality follow-up was complete through 2007. Participants were placed into 5 categories based on cTnT levels. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Magnetic resonance imaging measurements of cardiac structure and function and mortality through a median of 6.4 (interquartile range, 6.0-6.8) years of follow-up. RESULTS: In Dallas County, the prevalence of detectable cTnT (>/=0.003 ng/mL) was 25.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 22.7%-27.4%) with the highly sensitive assay vs 0.7% (95% CI, 0.3%-1.1%) with the standard assay. Prevalence was 37.1% (95% CI, 33.3%-41.0%) in men vs 12.9% (95% CI, 10.6%-15.2%) in women and 14.0% (95% CI, 11.2%-16.9%) in participants younger than 40 years vs 57.6% (95% CI, 47.0%-68.2%) in those 60 years and older. Prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy increased from 7.5% (95% CI, 6.4%-8.8%) in the lowest cTnT category (<0.003 ng/mL) to 48.1% (95% CI, 36.7%-59.6%) in the highest (>/=0.014 ng/mL) (P < .001); prevalence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction and chronic kidney disease also increased across categories (P < .001 for each). During a median follow-up of 6.4 years, there were 151 total deaths, including 62 cardiovascular disease deaths. All-cause mortality increased from 1.9% (95% CI, 1.5%-2.6%) to 28.4% (95% CI, 21.0%-37.8%) across higher cTnT categories (P < .001). After adjustment for traditional risk factors, C-reactive protein level, chronic kidney disease, and N-terminal pro-brain-type natriuretic peptide level, cTnT category remained independently associated with all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.8 [95% CI, 1.4-5.2] in the highest category). Adding cTnT categories to the fully adjusted mortality model modestly improved model fit (P = .02) and the integrated discrimination index (0.010 [95% CI, 0.002-0.018]; P = .01). CONCLUSION: In this population-based cohort, cTnT detected with a highly sensitive assay was associated with structural heart disease and subsequent risk for all-cause mortality.",nocancer
"CD34+ immunoselection of autologous grafts for the treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma. BACKGROUND: Graft contamination has been blamed for causing relapse in children with high-risk neuroblastoma (HRNB) after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). PROCEDURE: We report the long-term results of hematopoietic reconstitution, post-transplant complications, and clinical outcome of 44 children with HRNB treated with busulfan/melphalan high-dose chemotherapy followed by transplantation of purged CD34+ immunoselected autologous peripheral HSCT. Minimal residual disease (MRD) of grafts was evaluated by anti-GD2 immunofluorescence or tyrosine hydroxylase reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Contaminating neuroblasts were found in 19/38 grafts (50%) before CD34+ positive selection, and none after (technique sensitivity of one cell in 10(5)). A median of 6.5 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg (range 0.8-23.7) were transplanted with only 2% of TRM. Neutrophils and platelet recovery occurred within a median of 12 days (range 9-47) and 44 days (range 12-259), respectively, without any secondary graft failure. Twenty-three percents of patients experienced a sepsis (10/44) and 14% a pyelonephritis (6/44). Recurrence of varicella zoster virus occurred in 21% of patients (9/44). Negative RT-PCR MRD within the leukapheresis product and cis-retinoic acid therapy were significantly and independently associated to a better survival (P < 0.05). Overall and event-free survivals at 5 years post-transplant were at 59.3% and 48.3% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Besides high rates of manageable infections due to late immune recovery, transplantation with CD34+ immunoselected grafts in HRNB children was feasible and did not affect long-term hematopoiesis.",cancer
"Radical esophagectomy for esophageal cancer: results in Thai patients. BACKGROUND: Radical esophagectomy was reported to have prolonged survival in patients with esophageal cancer However, it is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Controversy still exists regarding value of radical esophagectomy MATERIAL AND METHOD: The authors analyzed the results, including complications and survival in 68 consecutive patients with esophageal cancer who were treated with transthoracic radical esophagectomy at the Department of Surgery, Siriraj hospital, Mahidol University between June 2002 and June 2008. RESULTS: There were 57 males and eight females with a mean age of 59.28 +/- 11.25 years. Regarding T staging, 81.5% of the patients were in T3 stage while 1.5% of the patients had Ti stage, 15.4% had T2 stage, and 1.5% had T4 stage. Lymph node metastasis (NI) was found in 63.1% of the patients and NO was in 36.9%. Most of the patients were in advanced stages with 53.8% in stage III, 44.6% in stage II, and 1.5% in stage I. The 5-year survival rate of the patients with node positive was significantly lower than the patients with node negative (p = 0.018). The survival was significantly better in stage Ilcompared to stage III (p = 0.012). Overall 5-year survival rate was 28. 5%. Most common complications were from pulmonary causes (22.1%), anastomotic leakage (8.8%), and wound infection (8.8%). Mortality rate was 4.41%. CONCLUSION: Radical esophagectomy was associated with relatively low mortality and acceptable survival. It should be considered in surgical treatment of patients with esophageal cancer",cancer
"Intra-ampullary papillary-tubular neoplasm (IAPN): characterization of tumoral intraepithelial neoplasia occurring within the ampulla: a clinicopathologic analysis of 82 cases. BACKGROUND: There has been no uniform terminology for systematic analysis of mass-forming preinvasive neoplasms (which we term tumoral intraepithelial neoplasia) that occur specifically within the ampulla. Here, we provide a detailed analysis of these neoplasms, which we propose to refer to as intra-ampullary papillary-tubular neoplasm (IAPN). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three hundred and seventeen glandular neoplasms involving the ampulla were identified through a review of 1469 pancreatoduodenectomies and 11 ampullectomies. Eighty-two neoplasms characterized by substantial preinvasive exophytic component that grew almost exclusively (>75%) within the ampulla (in the ampullary channel or intra-ampullary portions of the very distal segments of the common bile duct or pancreatic duct) were analyzed. RESULTS: (1) Clinical: The mean age was 64 years, male/female ratio was 2.4, and mean tumor size was 2.7 cm. (2) Pathology: The tumors had a mixture of both papillary and tubular growth (each constituting at least 25% of the lesion) in 57%; predominantly (>75%) papillary in 23%, and predominantly (>75%) tubular in 20%. High-grade dysplasia was present in 94% of cases, of which 39% showed focal (<25% of the lesion), 28% showed substantial (25% to 75%), and 27% showed extensive (>75%) high-grade dysplasia. In terms of cell-lineage morphology, 45% had a mixture of patterns. However, when evaluated with a forced-binary approach as intestinal (INT) versus gastric/pancreatobiliary (GPB) based on the predominant pattern, 74% were classified as INT and 26% as GPB. (3) Immunohistochemistry: Percent sensitivity/specificity of cell-lineage markers were, for INT phenotype: MUC2 85/78 and CDX2 94/61; and for GBP: MUC1 89/79, MUC5AC 95/69, and MUC6 83/76, respectively. Cytokeratin 7 and 20 were coexpressed in more than half. (4) Invasive carcinoma: In 64 cases (78%), there was an associated invasive carcinoma. Size of the tumor and amount of dysplasia correlated with the incidence of invasion. Invasive carcinoma was of INT-type in 58% and of pancreatobiliary-type in 42%. Cell lineage in the invasive component was the same as that of the preinvasive component in 84%. All discrepant cases were pancreatobiliary-type invasions, which occurred in INT-type preinvasive lesions. (5) Outcome: The overall survival of invasive cases were significantly worse than that of noninvasive ones (57% vs. 93%; P=0.01); and 3 years, 69% versus 100% (P=0.08); and 5 years, 45% versus 100% (P=0.07), respectively. When compared with 166 conventional invasive carcinomas of the ampullary region, invasive IAPNs had significantly better prognosis with a mean survival of 51 versus 31 months (P<0.001) and the 3-year survival of 69% versus 44% (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Tumoral intraepithelial neoplasia occurring within the ampulla are highly analogous to pancreatic or biliary intraductal papillary and tubular neoplasms as evidenced by their papillary and/or tubular growth, variable cell lineage, and spectrum of dysplastic change (adenoma-carcinoma sequence), and thus we propose to refer to these as IAPN. IAPNs are biologically indolent; noninvasive examples show an excellent prognosis, whereas those with invasion exhibit a malignant but nevertheless significantly better prognosis than typical invasive ampullary carcinomas unaccompanied by IAPNs. Twenty eight percent (64 of 230) of invasive carcinomas within the ampulla arise in association with IAPNs.",cancer

"Patient safety and quality improvement: a policy assessment. BACKGROUND: The regulation implementing the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 (PSQIA) was published on November 21, 2008, and became effective on January 19, 2009 (42 C.F.R. Part 3). PSQIA establishes a voluntary reporting system to enhance the data available to assess and resolve patient safety and health care quality issues. To encourage the reporting and analysis of medical errors, PSQIA provides federal privilege and confidentiality protections for patient safety information. PURPOSE: Greater reporting and analysis of patient safety events will yield increased data and better understanding of patient safety events. A PSO's workforce must have expertise in analyzing patient safety events, such as the identification, analysis, prevention, and reduction or elimination of the risks and hazards associated with the delivery of patient care. IMPLICATIONS: This new legislation provides a vehicle to better understand at a macro level how the clinical laboratory threatens patient safety and how that threat can be better controlled. What is imperative is that the clinical laboratory staff be involved in collecting and analyzing data. If they are not, the probability is high that data being reported by the laboratory will be misunderstood at the PSO and laboratories may be cited as a threat to patient safety because of a lack of understanding of laboratory operations.",nocancer
"Cooperation and competition: balanced scorecard and hospital privatization. PURPOSE: In 2000 the Skane Region (a public authority) and a private contractor made a five-year agreement for the provision of both in-patient care and out-patient medical services to about 30,000 inhabitants in the south-east part of the region. The Skane Region is the main provider of health care to about one million inhabitants in the south of Sweden and is responsible for all health care (private and public), including ten hospitals. This paper seeks to answer the question of how the Skane Region can control and cooperate with a private contractor, entering into competition with the public health care providers in the region. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: This is a longitudinal study conducted between 2001-2006. It is based on 28 taped interviews with employees responsible for the contracting process, participating observations and comprehensive secondary material. The study presents experiences made by the contractor and the public authority on how to work out and follow-up assignments within the health care sector regarding patient interest, public interest and professional medical interest. FINDINGS: Measurement within the frames of the balanced scorecard (BSC) made it possible to control both volumes and health care quality delivered by the private competing contractor. The political purchaser claims that the Skane Region has established a cost-effective and successful control system based on trust and measurement. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: This paper reports on a control system, between public purchaser and a private provider within health care, that focuses on and follow-up not only health care production but also health care quality.",nocancer

"Azerbaijan: health system review. The Health Systems in Transition (HiT) profiles are country-based reports that provide a detailed description of a health system and of policy initiatives in progress or under development. HiTs examine different approaches to the organization, financing and delivery of health services and the role of the main actors in health systems; describe the institutional framework, process, content and implementation of health and health care policies; and highlight challenges and areas that require more in-depth analysis. Azerbaijan gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Reform of the health care system in Azerbaijan has been incremental so that organizationally it still has many of the key hallmarks of the Soviet model of health care, the Semashko system. However, relatively low levels of government expenditure on health as a proportion of gross domestic product since independence has meant that out of pocket (OOP) payments accounted for almost 62% of total health expenditure in 2007. This has serious implications for access to care and financial risk protection for vulnerable households. The private provision of services is an increasingly important part of the health system, and services provided in parallel by other ministries and state enterprises continue to account for a certain amount of health expenditure. Revenues from the recent oil boom have been used to fund large capital investment projects such as the building of new hospitals with the latest technology and the import of modern equipment. However, future plans include the strengthening of primary care and the introduction of mandatory health insurance as part of major reforms to the health financing system.",nocancer
"Sorafenib efficacy in ovarian clear cell carcinoma revealed by transcriptome profiling. The purpose of this study was to investigate a new modality of therapy against ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC), a chemoresistant subtype of ovarian cancer. Microarray datasets of ovarian cancer cell lines and cancer tissues were analyzed using bioinformatic tools. The gene expression profile of OCCC was similar to that of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). This similarity was at least partially due to hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 pathway activation common to both malignancies. In addition, oncogenic pathway alterations were characteristic of OCCC including hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha subunit and relatively high Ras activities. Therefore, we predicted that the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib, which is approved for RCC and suppresses Ras activity, would also be effective against OCCC. Orally administered sorafenib (40 mg/kg per day) significantly inhibited tumor growth in nude mice when it was given after inoculation with the OCCC cell line RMG-2 (P = 0.002). Furthermore, sorafenib significantly reduced tumor size when it was administered to established RMG-2 tumors (P = 0.0002), while intraperitoneal injection of cisplatin (5 mg/kg per week) did not. In conclusion, the prominent anti-tumor effect of sorafenib against OCCC indicates that sorafenib is a promising candidate drug and supports the need for clinical trials using sorafenib against OCCC. This report demonstrates a method to utilize genome-wide information to facilitate translational research for treatments against less common subtypes of cancers.",cancer

"Oral health curricula in physician assistant programs: a survey of physician assistant program directors. PURPOSE: a review of the medical literature indicates that physician assistants (PAs) are not educationally prepared for oral health issues. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the status of oral health curricula and the knowledge and skills taught within PA curricula. METHODS: a survey examining oral health curricula in PA education was distributed electronically to the directors of all 142 accredited PA programs in the United States. The survey focused on aspects of oral health that programs currently teach and aspects that merit future inclusion. The survey data were analyzed using SPSS version 17. RESULTS: eighty-three of the 142 PA program directors (58.4%) responded to the survey. Over 74% believed that dental disease prevention should be addressed in PA education, yet only 21% of programs actually did so. Most respondents (94.7%) also agreed that PAs should routinely assess and screen for early signs of dental disease and counsel patients on preventing dental problems. Currently, over half of PA programs teach examination of children's teeth for cavities (55.6%), dedicating on average 3.6 hours toward oral health education. Most respondents (more than 90%) expressed a desire to implement an oral health module in their programs. On average, program directors felt that 5.3 hours should be dedicated to oral health. CONCLUSION: many PA program directors believe that PA programs are responsible for educating students about oral health; however, most PA program directors report a lack of oral health education within their curricula.",nocancer
"Imprint cytology in diagnosing-primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the breast during intraoperative frozen consultation: a case report. BACKGROUND; Primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the breast is uncommon among primary malignant breast tumors. Here we present a case diagnosed as primary breast lymphoma with imprint cytology during intraoperative frozen consultation. CASE: A 67-year-old woman presented with a palpable, non-tender mass in her left breast that she had had for 2 weeks. The mammogram and ultrasound studies revealed 1 lobular mass in the left breast without axillary lymphadenopathy. Imprint cytology helped diagnose malignant lymphoma of the breast, preventing radical surgery. CONCLUSION: Frozen artifact may obscure the evaluation of cytomorphology during intraoperative consultation. Imprint cytology may help due to less artifact with the cytologic details. Primary breast lymphomas should be considered in the differential diagnosis of breast tumors. The current literature recommendation of intermediate to high grade lymphoma is combined partial mastectomy followed by chemotherapy with local radiotherapy.",cancer
"Surgical outcome of coaxial phacoemulsification with torsional ultrasound after a 2.4 mm versus 3.2 mm clear corneal temporal incision. PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate and compare outcomes of phacoemulsification surgery with purely torsional ultrasound in coaxial small incision procedures. METHODS: This study was a prospective observational series of 50 eyes of 50 patients with age-related cataracts. There were two groups each with 25 eyes. Group 1 eyes were treated with microcoaxial phacoemulsification using a 2.4 mm temporal clear corneal incision; group 2 eyes were treated with phacoemulsification using a 3.2 mm temporal clear corneal incision. Both groups underwent a standardised surgical procedure using purely torsional ultrasound. Outcome measures were best corrected visual acuity, percentage increase in postoperative corneal thickness, and surgically-induced astigmatism assessed at day 1, week 1, month 1 and month 3 postoperatively. RESULTS: Both groups were comparable with respect to age, cataract grading and intraoperative parameters such as cumulative dissipated energy and irrigation volume. The only statistically significant outcome difference was surgically induced astigmatism at postoperative day 1 (higher in group 2). Intraoperative and early postoperative complications were similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Coaxial phacoemulsification with purely torsional ultrasound produced satisfactory results for 2.4 mm and 3.2 mm incisions. There were no differences in outcomes between groups.",nocancer
"Prevalence of anterior knee pain and pes planus in Israel defense force recruits. This study examined the prevalence of anterior knee pain (AKP) and pes planus (PP) in Israeli defense force recruits and assessed the relationship between these conditions. We examined the medical records of 97,279 recruits--18,338 females and 78,941 males. The prevalence of AKP was 4.15%. It was lower in females (2.39%) than in males (4.56%). The prevalence of flexible and rigid PP were 15.30% and 0.83%, respectively. The prevalence of both conditions was lower in females (11.31% and 0.34%) than in males (16.23% and 0.94%). AKP was more prevalent in individuals with flexible PP (4.50%) than with normal feet (4.06%) and more prevalent in individuals with rigid PP (6.93%) than in individuals with flexible PP. Despite current opinion, AKP is more common in males than in females. The role of orthotics in individuals with AKP and PP should be more thoroughly investigated.",nocancer
"Endocrine gland derived-VEGF is down-regulated in human pituitary adenoma. BACKGROUND: Endocrine gland-derived vascular endothelial growth factor (EG-VEGF) is an angiogenic molecule restricted to endocrine glands and, particularly, to steroid-secreting cells. The expression of EG-VEGF and its significance in human adenohypophysis in physiological and pathological conditions is still unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we investigated by immunohistochemistry the expression of EG-VEGF in 2 samples of normal adenohypophysis and 43 bioptic samples of pituitary adenoma. Moreover, the expression of growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and adrenocorticoprophic hormone (ACTH) were also estimated. RESULTS: The results of this study for the first time demonstrate a down-regulation of EG-VEGF expression in human pituitary adenoma as compared to normal adenohypophysis, suggesting an impaired function of the neoplastic cells in terms of hormone release in the blood stream, as a consequence of impaired tumor angiogenesis in the tumor. CONCLUSION: On the basis of our data showing a marked decrease in the expression of EG-VEGF in pituitary adenoma, with the exception of LH-secreting adenomas, we suggest that LH might be involved in the induction of EG-VEGF secretion.",cancer
"Indications and outcomes for mandibular reconstruction using sequential bilateral fibula flaps. BACKGROUND: A subset of patients with recurrent or second intraoral tumors undergo both primary and secondary mandibular reconstruction using bilateral fibula flaps. The objective of this report is to describe indications and outcomes for these patients. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database was performed. Charts were reviewed to identify demographics, operative features, and functional outcomes. RESULTS: Ten patients underwent mandibular reconstruction with a second fibula flap for recurrent or second oral tumors. Time between flaps averaged 20 months. Bone gap size measured 8 cm after both resections. Eighty percent of secondary resections included the mandibular arch, in contrast to 20 percent of primary resections (p=0.070). Compared with primary resections, secondary soft-tissue defects were larger and more frequently included composite tissues. There were low complication rates and no flap failures after both reconstructions. Functional evaluation showed a greater dependency on supplemental enteral nutrition after the second resection (p=0.033). Five patients died at a median of 12.5 months after the second resection and the remaining patients have survived for a median of 18.6 months. CONCLUSIONS: The principal indication for second fibula flaps in mandibular reconstruction is central segment defects where rigid support is required to prevent sequelae of the Andy Gump deformity. For lateral resections, the large soft-tissue deficits of secondary extirpation may be better served by reconstruction with soft-tissue flaps. Second osseous free flaps can be performed safely, but with a significant decline in postoperative oropharyngeal function. Goals of surgery and quality of life need to be addressed before ablation of recurrent or second oral tumors is performed.",cancer
"Peri-implant diseases. Peri-implant diseases are inflammatory conditions that affect the soft and hard supporting tissues around implant fixtures. Peri-implant mucositis usually responds to oral hygiene instructions, scaling and prophylaxis, but peri-implantitis, which involves bone resorption, has less predictable treatment outcomes following non-surgical management. Adjunctive treatment for decontaminating sites may include the use of antimicrobials and resistant cases may sometimes be managed with a surgical approach. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: As dental implant-retained prostheses become more popular the prevalence of peri-implant complications will also increase. Dental practitioners and care professionals should appreciate their potential roles in the management of these conditions.",nocancer
"Cytomorphology of hibernoma: a report of 2 cases. BACKGROUND: Hibernoma, a benign neoplasm of the brown fat, clinically and radiologically can mimic a lipoma or liposarcoma, especially in the retroperitoneum. As treatment modalities vary, an accurate preoperative diagnosis may help the surgeon to plan treatment. Hence cytologic features of 2 cases of hibernoma are described. CASES: Two middle-aged men diagnosed clinically as having lipomas were subjected to fine needle aspiration (FNA). Smears revealed typical hibernoma cells with a minor percentage of eosinophilic cells and mature adipocytes. CONCLUSION: FNA is a highly sensitive and specific tool for the diagnosis of hibernoma.",cancer
"Sialidase of Streptococcus intermedius: a putative virulence factor modifying sugar chains. A sialidase gene of Streptococcus intermedius was cloned. It was most similar to nanA, a major sialidase gene in Streptococcus pneumoniae, and was expressed in Escherichia coli. Since the gene-knockout S. intermedius strain lost detectable sialidase activity, the gene might code, either solely or mainly, the glycosidase in the bacterial genome. Polymerase chain reaction using the primers for the nanA homologue in S. intermedius (described as nanA below) showed that this sialidase gene was commonly distributed within the isolates of S. intermedius, but not found in the strains of other species among the anginosus group. In biofilm formation assay under cultivation with mucin, the nanA-deleted S. intermedius maintained the amount of biofilm for 72 hr, while that of the parent strain decreased during incubation from 24 to 72 hr. Since sialidase activity in the parent strain increased during that time period, sialidase might contribute to the degradation of biofilm under sialic acid-rich conditions. When S. intermedius was added into the HepG2 hepatoma culture, the calculated disassociation constant (K(d)) of EDTA-releasable bacterial adhesion to the cells was higher in the nanA-deleted strain than in the parent. Furthermore, the rate constant, assuming endocytosis of the bacterium mediated by ASGP-R in HepG2 cells, seemed to be increased by sialidase pretreatment of the bacterial cells before addition to the cell culture. According to the results, modification of sugar chains by sialidase on the bacterial surface and in the surrounding environment might influence both bacterial interaction and host-bacterial interaction in S. intermedius.",nocancer
"Drug dispensing and information giving in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to examine drug dispensing and associated activity in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. The paper aims to describe factors associated with patient information giving and dispensing time. DESIGN/METHODOLOGYLAPPROACH: A specific protocol for recording data gathered from observations included: number of dispensing sessions; medical specialties active at the time; medication number and type; dispensing outcome; if information giving was observed and dispensing time. Information giving and time were considered response variables. The chi-square test and odds-ratios were used to verify associations between response and explanatory variables. FINDINGS: In 43 percent (45) consultations, information giving accompanied dispensing and was associated with number of dispensing sessions and medical specialty offered on a particular day. Assistance time was associated with drug type and number, which increased as dispensing sessions decreased. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: Seasonal variations in the demand for pharmacy assistance were not investigated and sample size precluded multivariate analyses. Consequently, new studies may deepen understanding about communication between physicians, pharmacy assistants and users. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Pharmacy staff could improve quality and efficiency if two aspects were taken into account: fluctuating workload, and external conditions within which tasks are undertaken. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The paper identifies external conditions that interfere with drug dispensing.",nocancer
"Soft tissue damage after minimally invasive THA. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) for hip replacement is thought to minimize soft tissue damage. We determined the damage caused by 4 different MIS approaches as compared to a conventional lateral transgluteal approach. METHODS: 5 surgeons each performed a total hip arthroplasty on 5 fresh frozen cadaver hips, using either a MIS anterior, MIS anterolateral, MIS 2-incision, MIS posterior, or lateral transgluteal approach. Postoperatively, the hips were dissected and muscle damage color-stained. We measured proportional muscle damage relative to the midsubstance cross-sectional surface area (MCSA) using computerized color detection. The integrity of external rotator muscles, nerves, and ligaments was assessed by direct observation. RESULTS: None of the other MIS approaches resulted in less gluteus medius muscle damage than the lateral transgluteal approach. However, the MIS anterior approach completely preserved the gluteus medius muscle in 4 cases while partial damage occurred in 1 case. Furthermore, the superior gluteal nerve was transected in 4 cases after a MIS anterolateral approach and in 1 after the lateral transgluteal approach. The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve was transected once after both the MIS anterior approach and the MIS 2-incision approach. INTERPRETATION: The MIS anterior approach may preserve the gluteus medius muscle during total hip arthroplasty, but with a risk of damaging the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve.",nocancer

"Chemotherapy in severe nasal polyposis--a possible beneficial effect? A report of three cases. BACKGROUND: Nasal polyposis is an inflammatory process of the nasal mucosa. Treatment has changed from surgery to an anti-inflammatory approach, but neither of these treatments addresses the underlying cause. Topical steroids and occasional use of systemic steroids in patients with nasal polyposis can frequently control the polypoid disease. In a few cases, when the disease is more aggressive, the repeated application of systemic steroids together with sinus surgery is required. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We present our experience with one case of rheumatoid arthritis and two cases with malignant diseases, all of which were treated with chemotherapy and were also accompanied by severe nasal polyposis. All of our patients had eosinophilic polypoid disease. Various chemotherapeutic treatment schemes were utilized. RESULTS: During chemotherapy all three patients were markedly improved symptomatically including olfaction along with a significant reduction in their nasal polyposis. Duration of remission lasted for a few months in two cases and for three years, in a third case. CONCLUSION: This is the first report describing the successful treatment of severe nasal polyposis with chemotherapy. Based on this experience, we suggest a phase II trial with chemotherapy, preferably ""low dose"" methotrexate, in patients with severe nasal polyposis.",cancer
"Utility of cell block preparation in endometrial aspiration cytology: a report of 4 cases. BACKGROUND: Endometrial aspiration (EA) cytology is a simple yet highly useful diagnostic procedure for uterine and extrauterine malignancies. CASES: Two postmenopausal women underwent EA following ultrasonographic findings of unilateral hydrosalpinx and fluid in the endometrial cavity. A few atypical glandular clusters were detected on cytologic smears. Sections from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) cell block preparations revealed fragments of uterine papillary serous carcinoma showing strong positivity of tumor cell nuclei to p53 on immunohistochemistry (IHC). A 78-year-old woman suffering from intestinal Crohn's disease was found to have a cystic lesion of the right adnexa and fluid level in the endometrial cavity on ultrasonography. Acellular, ringlike structures were noted on cytologic smears of the EA. Sections from the FFPE cell block demonstrated the structures to be periodic acid-Schiff-positive Liesegang rings. A 43-year-old woman underwent diagnostic hysteroscopy and EA for prolonged, excessive vaginal discharge. Cytologic features of endometrial cellular clusters were obscured by a dirty background and macrophages. Sections from the FFPE cell block showed normal proliferative endometrium with CD10-positive endometrial stroma, thus ruling out malignancy. CONCLUSION: Conclusion FFPE cell block preparation is a valuable adjunctive tool for EA in the evaluation of endometrial lesions, ensuring excellent quality of preparations for special stains and IHC.",cancer
"Preoperative imaging diagnosis of carotid body tumors. Carotid body tumors (CBTs) are relatively frequent lesions encountered at high altitudes, such in as the Andean Mountains. A correct preoperative diagnosis is essential for surgical planning and performance. For this reason, we have reviewed the evolution of our experience in the imaging diagnosis of these tumors. Between 1980 and June 2008, 160 CBTs were diagnosed. A total of 138 tumors were operated on, 4 are waiting for surgery, and 18 were not operated on because of age, medical conditions, or patient refusal. We have reviewed retrospectively the modalities of imaging diagnosis in our patients who underwent operation. Among the 138 tumors operated on, a correct preoperative diagnosis was done in 127 cases (92%). The preoperative diagnosis of the remaining 11 patients was unspecified benign tumor for 6 patients and neck lymph node for 5 patients. The imaging methods performed by different radiologists were conventional ultrasound, color Doppler ultrasound, carotid conventional angiography (CA), axial tomography, magnetic resonance and magnetic resonance angiography, and computed tomographic angiography (CTA). Most patients had more than one image study. Review of radiologist reports revealed a correct diagnosis in all carotid CA, magnetic resonance studies, and CTA. Additionally, CTA appeared to be a valuable method to predict the Shamblin group. Clinical suspicion and current image techniques permit a correct diagnosis in practically all cases of CBT.",cancer
"The expression of the miRNA-200 family in endometrial endometrioid carcinoma. OBJECTIVE: Recent reports suggest that targeting the unique miRNAs highly expressed in several cancers may be a promising approach in the development of new cancer therapeutic tools. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the roles of miRNAs as therapeutic targets in human endometrial endometrioid carcinomas (EECs). METHODS: We evaluated the differential expressions of miRNAs in EECs and normal endometrial tissues using microarrays and cluster analysis. After validation of differentially expressed miRNAs in another set of EECs and normal endometrial tissues, we performed the in vitro experiment using endometrial cancer cells with anti-miRNA (anti-miR) to evaluate the roles of miRNAs that are highly expressed in EECs for cell proliferation and chemosensitivity. RESULTS: A miRNA microarray showed that the miR-200 family, including hsa-miR-141, hsa-miR-200a, hsa-miR-200b, hsa-miR-200c, and hsa-miR-429, was up-regulated in EECs as compared with that in normal endometrial tissues. When we treated endometrial cancer cells with specific anti-miRs, including anti-miR-141, -200a, -200b, -200c, or -429, we found that anti-miR-200a, -200b, -200c, and -429 significantly inhibited the growth of HEC-1A cells and anti-miR-141, -200c, and -429 significantly inhibited the growth of Ishikawa cells. Moreover, transfection with anti-miR-429 enhanced the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin in HEC-1A cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the miR-200 family is highly expressed in EECs compared with that of normal endometrial tissues and could play an important role in cancer growth. Specifically, anti-miR-429 could enhance the cytotoxic activity with cisplatin in EECs. Therefore, the miR-200 family may offer new candidate targets to be exploited in therapeutic strategies for patients with these carcinomas.",cancer
"Pregnancy and adnexal torsion: analysis of 20 cases. OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical profile, management and outcome of pregnancy complicated by adnexal torsion. METHODS: All pregnancy cases complicated by adnexal torsion admitted between January 2001 and January 2009 were analyzed. RESULTS: The total number of pregnant cases was 20. Age range of pregnant women with adnexal torsion was 18 to 42 years. Of these cases 70% were seen in the first and second trimester. Seventy percent of cases were operated by the laparotomy route and 30% by laparoscopy. Salpingo-oophorectomy was performed in 70% of cases and detorsion in 30% of cases. Histopathologic examinations revealed five patients (25%) had serous cystadenoma, four patients (20%) mucinous cystadenoma, six patients (20%) dermoid cyst and five patients (25%) hemorrhagic cyst. CONLUSIONS: Adnexal torsion as a differential diagnosis of acute abdomen in pregnancy should be considered and we recommend early surgical treatment that will save the adnexa.",cancer
"The value of 99mTc-tetrofosmin brain SPECT in predicting survival in patients with glioblastoma multiforme. (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin brain SPECT has been reported as a useful tool for the evaluation of glioma proliferation. In the present study, we set out to investigate the prognostic value of (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin brain SPECT in patients with glioblastoma multiforme. METHODS: We prospectively studied 18 patients (13 men, 5 women; mean age +/- SD, 60.8 +/- 7.79 y) who were operated on for glioblastoma multiforme. All patients underwent preoperative (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin brain SPECT, and surgical excision was performed within a week after SPECT. All patients received postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy. RESULTS: By calculating the lesion-to-normal (L/N) (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin uptake ratio, we found that patients with an L/N ratio of more than 4.7 had significantly worse survival than did patients with an L/N ratio of 4.7 or less. Furthermore, patients with a Karnofsky Performance Score more than 90 had a significantly better survival rate. Although patients with near-total tumor resection who were younger than 60 y survived longer, the difference did not reach statistical significance. In the multivariate analysis, (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin uptake and Karnofsky Performance Score were identified as factors with independent prognostic power. CONCLUSION: (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin brain SPECT may be an independent prognostic factor in patients with glioblastoma multiforme. Further larger studies are needed to verify these results.",cancer
"Intracortical lesions: relevance for new MRI diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis. OBJECTIVE: To generate and validate new MRI diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis (MS) taking into account not only white matter lesions but also intracortical lesions (ICLs). METHODS: Brain double inversion recovery and brain and cord T2- and postcontrast T1-weighted scans were acquired in a training (80 patients with clinically isolated syndromes [CIS], median follow-up = 55.3 months) and a validation (39 patients with CIS, median follow-up = 28.0 months) sample. In the training sample, regression analysis and Cox proportional hazard model were used to identify MRI variables independently predicting the evolution to clinically definite (CD) MS. The best criterion selected was then validated. The performance of the new and previously available MRI criteria for disease dissemination in space (DIS) and time (DIT) were tested. RESULTS: The final multivariate model showed that >/=1 ICL (p < 0.001), >/=1 infratentorial (p = 0.03), and >/= 1 gadolinium-enhancing or >/=1 spinal cord lesion (p = 0.004) were independent predictors of CDMS. The presence of at least 2 of these variables was the best DIS criterion in both samples. New ICLs had a poor sensitivity for DIT. The combination of the new DIS criterion with the MAGNIMS criteria for DIT yielded to an accuracy of 81%, which was higher than those of the other available criteria. CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy of MRI diagnostic criteria for MS is increased when considering the presence of ICLs on baseline scans from patients at presentation with CIS suggestive of MS. If confirmed by other studies, ICL detection might be considered in future diagnostic algorithms for MS.",nocancer
"Pediatric cochlear implantation: a qualitative study of parental decision-making processes in Flanders, Belgium. Factors contributing to parents' decision when they choose between cochlear implantation (CI) and traditional hearing aids for their child were examined. The subjects were children with severe/profound hearing loss, born 1999-2001, registered in the universal neonatal hearing screening program in the Flanders region of Belgium. Qualitative data collected retrospectively from parents were subjected to thematic content analysis. In their responses to professional advice, parents were segmented into 3 groups: (a) those whose primary considerations were the importance of oral language development and the relative potential of CI and traditional hearing aids; (b) those for whom alternative factors (e.g., medical risks, ethical issues) were paramount, even in the face of professional advocacy of CI; (c) those who followed professional advice against CI. The researchers conclude that care professionals should be sensitive to the impact of their advice and other factors in parental decision making.",nocancer
"PKCalpha/beta I inhibitor Go6976 induces dephosphorylation of constitutively hyperphosphorylated Rb and G1 arrest in T24 cells. BACKGROUND: Rb functions as a key controller of the G(1)-S transition of the cell cycle, and its inactivation leads to a defective G(1) checkpoint. Bladder cancer frequently displays alterations in Rb such as constitutive hyperphosphorylation which results in inactive Rb and progression of cells to the S-phase. Several protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors are currently undergoing clinical trials as anticancer drugs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: T24 urinary bladder carcinoma cells, known to express hyperphosphorylated Rb, were treated with PKCalpha/betaI inhibitor Go6976. The treated cells were subjected to cell cycle analysis, cell growth assay and Western blots for Rb and cdc2 phosphorylation. RESULTS: The treatment resulted in Rb dephosphorylation at Ser 795 and Ser 807/811, and cdc2 dephosphorylation at Tyr15. Subsequent G(0/1) arrest and reduced proliferation rates were observed. CONCLUSION: The results show that Go6976 can be used to restore constantly hyperphosphorylated and therefore constantly inactive Rb function in cancer cells.",cancer

"A multicenter study of survival after neoadjuvant radiotherapy/chemotherapy and esophagectomy for ypT0N0M0R0 esophageal cancer. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate 5-year survival of patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer (LAEC) who have undergone multimodality treatment with complete histopathologic response. BACKGROUND: Patients with LAEC may obtain excellent local-regional response to multimodality therapy. The overall benefit of a complete histopathologic response, when no viable tumor is present in the surgical specimen, is incompletely understood and existing data are limited to single-center studies with relatively few patients. The aim of this multicenter study was to define the outcome of patients with complete histopathologic response after multimodality therapy for LAEC. METHODS: The study population included 299 patients (229 male, 70 female; median age: 60 years) with LAEC (cT2N1M0, T3-4N0-1M0; 181 adenocarcinomas, 118 squamous carcinomas) who underwent either neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (n = 284) or chemotherapy (n = 15) followed by esophagectomy at 6 specialized centers: Europe (3) and United States (3). All patients in the study had stage ypT0N0M0R0 after resection. RESULTS: Esophagectomy with thoracotomy (n = 255) was more frequent than with a transhiatal approach (n = 44). The median number of analyzed lymph nodes in the surgical specimens was 20 (minimum-maximum: 1-77). Thirty-day mortality rate was 2.4% and 90-day mortality rate was 5.7%. Overall 5-year survival rate was 55%. The disease-specific 5-year survival rate was 68%, with a recurrence rate of 23.4% (n = 70; local vs distant recurrence: 3.3% vs 20.1%). Cox regression analysis identified age as the only independent predictor of survival, whereas gender, histology, type of esophagectomy, type of neoadjuvant therapy, and the number of resected lymph nodes had no prognostic impact. CONCLUSION: Patients with histopathologic complete response at the time of resection of LAEC achieve excellent survival.",cancer
"Functional expressions of the aging brain. In the conventional view, aging of the brain is associated with atrophy vascular abnormalities and loss of volume in hippocampus and amygdala. Cognitively, aging is associated with slowing of processing and memory loss. However, many studies of aging do not examine the cases to exclude demented people. The nutrition and memory in the homebound elderly study (NAME) excluded cases clinically diagnosed as having dementia. Cortical atrophy based on MRI ratings was significantly correlated with vascular disease, white matter hyperintensities, processing speed, and memory but not hippocampus and amygdala volume. Renal function and homocysteine were also associated with cortical atrophy but not with the cognitive variables. In conclusion, brain atrophy of aging in the absence of dementia is related to vascular disease but not hippocampal atrophy. Studies of nutritional interventions should consider using MRI atrophy rather than cognition as outcome.",nocancer
"Long-term safety, tolerability, and consistency of effect of fentanyl pectin nasal spray for breakthrough cancer pain in opioid-tolerant patients. OBJECTIVE: to assess the long-term safety, tolerability, and consistency of effect of fentanyl pectin nasal spray (FPNS) in patients with breakthrough cancer pain (BTCP). DESIGN: a multicenter, open-label study. PATIENTS: patients with chronic cancer pain treated with > or = 60 mg/d oral morphine or equivalent experiencing 1-4 episodes per day of BTCP. INTERVENTION: all patients entered into a 16-week treatment phase after undergoing a dose-titration phase with FPNS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: safety and tolerability were assessed by adverse events (AEs) and by nasal tolerability assessments. Consistency of effect was monitored through additional rescue medication use and FPNS dose change. RESULTS: four hundred three patients were included in the safety analyses. Of these, 356 patients entered the treatment phase and 110 patients completed the study. FPNS was self-administered for 42,227 episodes. During the treatment phase, 99 patients (24.6 percent) reported treatment-related AEs; most were mild or moderate and typical of opioids. Serious AEs were reported by 61 patients (15.1 percent), but only five were considered related to study drug. Of the 80 deaths that occurred during this study, one was assessed as possibly related to study drug. Nasal assessments revealed no significant local effects. No additional rescue medication was required after 94 percent of FPNS-treated episodes. More than 90 percent of patients required no increase in their initial dose of FPNS. CONCLUSIONS: FPNS use for BTCP was associated with AEs, typical of opioids, with no evidence of nasal toxicity. A large proportion of BTCP episodes were treated with a single dose, and doses remained stable over the 4-month period.",cancer
"The association of preoperative thrombocytosis with prognostic factors in malign ovarian tumor. PURPOSE: We assessed the association of preoperative thrombocytosis with prognostic factors in malign ovarian tumor. METHODS: Over a five-year period, cases treated for ovarian cancer were randomly assigned. The data were collected from gynecological oncology, radiation oncology, medical oncology and pathology departments. Statistical analyses were carried out by using the statistical packages for SPSS 12.0 for Windows (Chicago, IL, USA). Survival was analyzed by the method of Kaplan and Meier, using log-rank (Mantel-Cox) analysis. RESULTS: 51 cases with ovarian cancer were evaluated. Cases with thrombocytosis were found to have greater CA-125 levels, more advanced stage disease, more ascites and shorter periods of survival. CONCLUSION: Thrombocytosis is a poor prognostic factor in ovarian cancer. As reported previously, it is associated with aggressive tumor biology. Thus, preoperative thrombocytosis can be a used as a marker of poor outcomes.",cancer
"Children with acute leukemia: a comparison of outcomes from allogeneic blood stem cell and bone marrow transplantation. BACKGROUND: The relative merits of peripheral blood stem-cell transplantation (PBSCT) versus bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for children with standard and high-risk hematologic malignancies remain unclear. In a retrospective study, we compared allogeneic PBSCT (n = 30) with BMT (n = 110) in children with acute leukemia between January 2001 and September 2006. PROCEDURE: Median age for PBSCT was 9 years versus 8 years for BMT. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the demographic and medical variables. The unadjusted probabilities of disease-free survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The association of graft-source and time to each of the study endpoints was estimated by Cox's regression model and the occurrence of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) was included as a time-dependent covariate. RESULTS: Time to neutrophil engraftment and platelet independence was faster after PBSCT than BMT (neutrophils 15.0 days vs. 17.0 days, P < 0.001; platelets, 21.0 days vs. 27.0 days, P = 0.034). The cumulative incidence of grades II-IV acute GvHD at 100 days was 10.4% (SE 5.6%) after PBSCT and 15.1% (SE 3.5%) after BMT (P = NS). The cumulative incidence of chronic GvHD was 13.8% (SE 6.3%) after PBSCT and 11.3% (SE 3.1%) after BMT (P = NS). One-year disease-free survival was 37.9% (SE 9.0%) for PBSCT recipients versus 65.1% (SE 4.6%) after BMT (P = 0.005) but this difference was not sustained in multivariate analysis. Thus, only disease risk and pre-transplant CMV seropositivity were significant predictors of disease-free survival.

AIM: To evaluate whether expression of L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) in pretreatment rectal cancer biopsies is predictive of tumour response to neoadjuvant hyperthermo-chemoradiotherapy (HCRT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-four patients with rectal adenocarcinoma who received neoadjuvant HCRT were investigated. LAT1 expression was immunohistochemically evaluated using pretreatment biopsies. The operation was performed after 2-3 months following HCRT and each resected specimen was graded by the histological criteria of the Japanese Classification of Colorectal Carcinoma. RESULTS: A positive LAT1 expression was recognized in 50.0% (22/44) of patients. Resected specimens were divided into 2 groups according to the histological grading criteria: good response (n=29) and poor response (n=15). LAT1-negative tumours had an 81.8% probability of good response and 18.2% probability of poor response. LAT1 expression showed marginally significant association with response to HCRT (p=0.05). CONCLUSION: LAT1 may be a useful predictive marker of response to HCRT in rectal cancer.,cancer
"Educational governance in the NHS: a literature review. PURPOSE: This paper aims to survey the literature relating to educational governance's application to healthcare. Its purpose is to establish the extent to which this type of governance is recognised by healthcare staff, and to develop an understanding of how it is defined and used. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The starting point for the literature review was an academic database search supplemented by a Google Scholar search. The results were sifted using evidence strength criteria and filtered for relevance using secondary keywords. FINDINGS: The educational governance in healthcare literature search indicates that this is a relatively under-researched area. There are few attempts to define educational governance, although several authors note similarities with clinical governance. Authors cite educational governance as an important component of integrated approaches to healthcare governance, noting inter-dependent relationships between areas such as clinical governance, organisational development and risk management. RESEARCH LIMITATION/IMPLICATIONS: Given the diverse academic and grey literature used for the review, it was difficult to apply conventional evidence-strength scales, especially because most articles cited in the text are based on expert opinion rather than systematic review. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The review highlights educational governance's value to healthcare organisations and provides references for organisational staff contemplating developing this area. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The paper is the first known attempt to survey the literature relating to National Health Service educational governance.",nocancer
"Temporomandibular disorder pain in adult Saudi Arabians referred for specialised dental treatment. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of Temporomandibular Disorders (TMD) pain in Saudi Arabians,aged 20-40, who were referred to the Specialist Dental Centre in Makkah. The material included 325 patients (135 males,190 females) who answered a history questionnaire. Patients reportingTMD pain in the last month were offered a clinical examination. History questionnaires and clinical examinations were done according to the Arabic version of the Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMD (RDC/TMD). Fifty-eight patients (18%) reported TMD pain; 46 were clinically examined. Mean age of clinically examined TMD pain patients was 30 +/- 7 years with a male-female ratio of 1:6 (P < 0.001). All TMD pain patients had a diagnosis of myofascial pain, and 65% had diagnoses of arthralgia or osteoarthritis. Headaches or migraines in the last 6 months and headaches in the last month were reported in high frequencies in the TMD pain group, 93% and 71% respectively, with differences (P < 0.001) between the TMD pain and non-TMD pain groups. Graded Chronic Pain Scale assessments classified 45% of the TMD pain patients in grade 1, 53% in grade II, 2% in grade III, and 0% in grade IV. Severe depression scores were found in 38% of the TMD pain patients and severe somatisation scores in 60% with differences (P < 0.001) between the TMD pain and non-TMD pain groups. In conclusion, the study found a frequency of TMD pain in this Saudi Arabian cohort of 18%. The TMD pain group presented high scores of depression and somatisation but low disability grades on the Graded Chronic Pain Scale.",nocancer
"Effect of retirement on major chronic conditions and fatigue: French GAZEL occupational cohort study. OBJECTIVES: To determine, using longitudinal analyses, if retirement is followed by a change in the risk of incident chronic diseases, depressive symptoms, and fatigue. Design Prospective study with repeat measures from 7 years before to 7 years after retirement. SETTING: Large French occupational cohort (the GAZEL study), 1989-2007. Participants 11 246 men and 2858 women. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Respiratory disease, diabetes, coronary heart disease and stroke, mental fatigue, and physical fatigue, measured annually by self report over the 15 year observation period; depressive symptoms measured at four time points. RESULTS: The average number of repeat measurements per participant was 12.1. Repeated measures logistic regression with generalised estimating equations showed that the cumulative prevalence of self reported respiratory disease, diabetes, and coronary heart disease and stroke increased with age, with no break in the trend around retirement. In contrast, retirement was associated with a substantial decrease in the prevalence of both mental fatigue (odds ratio for fatigue one year after versus one year before retirement 0.19, 95% confidence interval 0.18 to 0.21) and physical fatigue (0.27, 0.26 to 0.30). A major decrease was also observed in depressive symptoms (0.60, 0.53 to 0.67). The decrease in fatigue around retirement was more pronounced among people with a chronic disease before retirement. CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal modelling of repeat data showed that retirement did not change the risk of major chronic diseases but was associated with a substantial reduction in mental and physical fatigue and depressive symptoms, particularly among people with chronic diseases.",nocancer
"Suicides in national parks--United States, 2003-2009. In 2007, the year for which the most recent national data on fatalities are available, 34,598 suicides occurred in the United States (rate: 11.3 per 100,000 population); 79% were among males. In 2009, an estimated 374,486 visits to hospital emergency departments occurred for self-inflicted injury, of which approximately 262,000 (70%) could be attributed to suicidal behavior. The majority (58%) were among females. Most suicides (77%) occur in the home, but many occur in public places, including national parks. In addition to the loss of life, suicides consume park resources and staff time and can traumatize witnesses. To describe the characteristics of and trends in suicides in national parks, CDC and the National Park Service (NPS) analyzed reports of suicide events (suicides and attempted suicides) occurring in the parks during 2003-2009. During this 7-year span, 84 national parks reported 286 suicide events, an average of 41 events per year. Of the 286 events, 68% were fatal. The two most commonly used methods were firearms and falls. Consistent with national patterns, 83% of suicides were among males. A comprehensive, multicomponent approach is recommended to prevent suicide events, including enhanced training for park employees, site-specific barriers, and collaboration with communities.",nocancer

"Monosomy 12 and deletion of 13q34 in a case of chronic lymphocytic leukemia with concomitant lung cancer. BACKGROUND: We described a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and lung cancer and unusual chromosomal aberrations. CASE REPORT: At the same time with the diagnosis of B-cell CLL, squamocellular lung carcinoma diagnosis was established. Using interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization technique (FISH) we detected monosomy 12 and deletion of 13q34 occurred in the same clone. One month after the beginning of examination the patient died unexpectedly during sleep immediately before we applied a specific treatment for CLL or lung carcinoma. CONCLUSION: Simultaneous occurrence of monosomy 12 and deletion of 13q34 in a patient with B-cell CLL has been described only once before, but as a part of a complex karyotype. The prognostic significance of these abnormalities remains uncertain.",cancer
"Testis-specific protein on Y chromosome (TSPY) represses the activity of the androgen receptor in androgen-dependent testicular germ-cell tumors. Testis-specific protein on Y chromosome (TSPY) is an ampliconic gene on the Y chromosome, and genetic interaction with gonadoblastoma has been clinically established. However, the function of the TSPY protein remains to be characterized in physiological and pathological settings. In the present study, we observed coexpression of TSPY and the androgen receptor (AR) in testicular germ-cell tumors (TGCTs) in patients as well as in model cell lines, but such coexpression was not seen in normal testis of humans or mice. TSPY was a repressor for androgen signaling because of its trapping of cytosolic AR even in the presence of androgen. Androgen treatment stimulated cell proliferation of a TGCT model cell line, and TSPY potently attenuated androgen-dependent cell growth. Together with the finding that TSPY expression is reduced in more malignant TGCTs in vivo, the present study suggests that TSPY serves as a repressor in androgen-induced tumor development in TGCTs and raises the possibility that TSPY could be used as a clinical marker to assess the malignancy of TGCTs.",cancer
"Antiproliferative effects of rapamycin and celecoxib in angiosarcoma cell lines. BACKGROUND/AIM: Beyond their primary field of application some well-established drugs exhibit antitumour effects in a variety of cancers. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the COX2 inhibitor celecoxib and the mTOR antagonist rapamycin on angiosarcoma cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell proliferation was measured in ASM, ISOS 1 and ISO HAS angiosarcoma cell lines with the BrdU assay. RESULTS: In all angiosarcoma cell lines, celecoxib as well as rapamycin inhibited cell growth in a dose-dependent manner. In ASM and ISOS 1, but not in ISO HAS angiosarcoma cells, additive growth inhibitory effects were detected by combining both agents. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that angiosarcoma cell proliferation can be inhibited by subtoxic doses of rapamycin and celecoxib. Due to their direct and stroma-mediated anticancer activities, mTOR antagonists and COX2 inhibitors represent very promising drugs in the palliative treatment of angiosarcoma.",cancer
"Chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-induced oral mucositis: pathobiology, epidemiology and management. Oral mucositis is a debilitating complication of anticancer treatment, characterised by erythematous, atrophic, erosive or ulcerative lesions. Oral mucositis is almost always painful, affects eating, sleeping, and speech and affects the physiological and social well-being of the patient. The pathophysiology of the condition is not well understood. Guidelines to the treatment of oral mucositis are often contradictory so that there is no evidence based standard treatment protocol. Therefore the treatment is empiric. This paper offers a brief review of current knowledge of the pathophysiology and treatment of oral mucositis.",cancer

This observation supports the hypothesis that the dopaminergic system may play a role in the genesis or trigger of CH.",nocancer
"Single dose bioequivalence study of alpha-methyldopa tablet formulations using a modified HPLC method. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to compare the bioavailability of a new methyldopa (CAS 555-30-6) tablet formulation with that of a reference formulation in 12 healthy male subjects using a modified HPLC method. METHODS: The study was designed as an open label, single-dose, randomized study with a cross-over design. Under fasting conditions, each subject received one 250-mg tablet orally as a single dose of a test or reference formulation on two treatment days. The treatment periods were separated by a one-week washout period. The blood samples were collected at different time points after each administration and determined using a rapid and reliable modified HPLC method. The method used was validated for specificity, accuracy, precision and sensitivity. The pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, AUC0-t, AUC0-infinity) were statistically compared by analysis of variance (ANOVA) for test and reference formulations. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: All validation criteria for the developed HPLC method were in acceptable range. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of alpha-methyldopa was 270.3-1864.9 ng/ml for the test and 224.5-1585.6 ng/ml for the reference formulation. The mean AUC0-infinity of alpha-methyldopa was 2002.1-10614.8 and 2076.8- 9056.3 ng x h/ml for the test and reference formulation, respectively. The calculated 90% confidence intervals for the mean test/reference ratios of mentioned parameters were 92.48-115.94, and 88.82-101.13 which are in the bioequivalence range. The statistical tests did not show any statistical differences between formulations suggesting that methyldopa tablet of test and reference can be considered as bioequivalent preparations. CONCLUSION: A rapid and reliable HPLC method with fluorescence detector was developed to analyze alpha-methyldopa in human plasma. Based on the obtained results the test formulation of alpha-methyldopa is bioequivalent to the reference formulation.",nocancer
"Neoadjuvant therapy induces loss of MSH6 expression in colorectal carcinoma. Immunohistochemical stains are routinely used to detect abnormal DNA mismatch repair (MMR) protein expression in colorectal carcinomas, particularly when Lynch syndrome is suspected. Complete loss of MMR protein expression is often associated with underlying microsatellite instability (MSI), and the combined results of mutL homolog 1 (MLH1), postmeiotic segregation increased 2 (PMS2), mutS homolog 2 (MSH2), or mutS homolog 6 (MSH6) immunostains may point to the defective MMR protein in tumors with MSI. We have noted that some neoadjuvantly treated colorectal carcinomas display loss of MMR protein immunoexpression, despite a lack of underlying MSI and preserved staining in pretreatment tumor samples. The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of this finding. We identified 51 neoadjuvantly treated resected colorectal cancers. Posttreatment tumor samples were immunohistochemically stained with MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6 antibodies. Loss of staining for any marker was followed by analysis for MSI and assessment of MMR protein expression in pretreatment tumor samples. All of the 51 posttreatment tumor samples showed preserved MLH1, PMS2, and MSH2, but 10 posttreatment tumor samples (20%) showed decreased MSH6 staining. Of these, 9 posttreatment tumor samples displayed loss of staining in less than 100% of tumor cells, but preserved MSH6 expression in pretreatment tumor samples. One case showed a complete absence of MSH6 staining in both pretreatment and posttreatment tumor samples. All 10 cases were microsatellite stable. We conclude that extensive loss of MSH6 immunoexpression is common among neoadjuvantly treated colorectal carcinomas, but generally does not reflect underlying MSI. Therefore, diminished MSH6 staining in treated tumors should prompt immunohistochemical evaluation of pretreatment biopsy samples before genetic testing for Lynch syndrome.",cancer
"Small vascular and Alzheimer disease-related pathologic determinants of dementia in the oldest-old. The relative contributions of Alzheimer disease (AD) and vascular lesion burden to the occurrence of cognitive decline are more difficult to define in the oldest-old than they are in younger cohorts. To address this issue, we examined 93 prospectively documented autopsy cases from 90 to 103 years with various degrees of AD lesions, lacunes, and microvascular pathology. Cognitive assessment was performed prospectively using the Clinical Dementia Rating scale. Neuropathologic evaluation included the Braak neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) and beta-amyloid (Abeta) protein deposition staging and bilateral semiquantitative assessment of vascular lesions. Statistics included regression models and receiver operating characteristic analyses. Braak NFTs, Abeta deposition, and cortical microinfarcts (CMIs) predicted 30% of Clinical Dementia Rating variability and 49% of the presence of dementia. Braak NFT and CMI thresholds yielded 0.82 sensitivity, 0.91 specificity, and 0.84 correct classification rates for dementia. Using these threshold values, we could distinguish 3 groups of demented cases and propose criteria for neuropathologic definition of mixed dementia, pure vascular dementia, and AD in very old age. Braak NFT staging and severity of CMI allow for defining most of demented cases in the oldest-old. Most importantly, single cutoff scores for these variables that could be used in the future to formulate neuropathologic criteria for mixed dementia in this age group were identified.",nocancer
"Pathophysiology and definitions of seizures and status epilepticus. The pathophysiology of seizures is multifactorial and incompletely understood. Experimental work demonstrates that prolonged, abnormal, and excessive neuronal electrical activity in itself is injurious through several mechanisms independent of systemic acidosis and hypoxia. Population survival studies and laboratory investigations support the idea that brain injury and epileptogenesis result from status epilepticus. The basic distinction in seizure types is that of generalized and partial seizures. Correct classification of seizure types will aid in clinical communications and guide correct therapies. Revised definitions of generalized convulsive status epilepticus suggest making this diagnosis with as few as 5 minutes of continuous seizure activity.",nocancer
"Sickle-cell disease. Sickle-cell disease is one of the most common severe monogenic disorders in the world. Haemoglobin polymerisation, leading to erythrocyte rigidity and vaso-occlusion, is central to the pathophysiology of this disease, although the importance of chronic anaemia, haemolysis, and vasculopathy has been established. Clinical management is basic and few treatments have a robust evidence base. One of the main problems of sickle-cell disease in children is the development of cerebrovascular disease and cognitive impairment, and the role of blood transfusion and hydroxycarbamide for prevention of these complications is starting to be understood. Recurrent episodes of vaso-occlusion and inflammation result in progressive damage to most organs, including the brain, kidneys, lungs, bones, and cardiovascular system, which becomes apparent with increasing age. Most people with sickle-cell disease live in Africa, where little is known about this disease; however, we do know that the disorder follows a more severe clinical course in Africa than for the rest of the world and that infectious diseases have a role in causing this increased severity of sickle-cell disease. More work is needed to develop effective treatments that specifically target pathophysiological changes and clinical complications of sickle-cell disease.",nocancer
"Nasobronchial allergy and pulmonary function abnormalities among coir workers of Alappuzha. BACKGROUND: Coir is a commercially important natural fiber obtained from the coconut husk. Coir can be woven into strong twine or rope, and is used for padding mattresses, upholstery, etc. Coir industry provides a major share of occupation to the natives of Alappuzha district of Kerala State. It has been noticed earlier that there is increased incidence of nasobronchial allergy among the population involved in this industry. OBJECTIVES: This study was aimed at recognizing the symptomatology and pulmonary functional impairment among symptomatic coir workers. DESIGN: All coir workers who attended our institute over a period of three years were included in the study. Detailed occupational history was taken; symptom profile was studied in detail, clinical examination and pulmonary function tests conducted. RESULTS: Among the 624 symptomatic coir workers selected for this purpose, 64 patients had purely nasal symptoms, while 560 had symptoms of nasobronchial allergy. 357 patients had reversible obstruction on PFT, while 121 had only small airway obstruction. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that coir work induced nasobronchial allergy and pulmonary function abnormalities. In absence of CT scan and bronchial challenge testing it may be inappropriate to label coir work as occupational hazard. However the present study may be used as thought provoking study to initiate further understanding.",nocancer
"Spectrum of SMARCB1/INI1 mutations in familial and sporadic rhabdoid tumors. BACKGROUND: Germline mutations and deletions of SMARCB1/INI1 in chromosome band 22q11.2 predispose patients to rhabdoid tumor and schwannomatosis. Previous estimates suggested that 15-20% of rhabdoid tumors were caused by an underlying germline abnormality of SMARCB1. However, these studies were limited by case selection and an inability to detect intragenic deletions and duplications. PROCEDURE: One hundred matched tumor and blood samples from patients with rhabdoid tumors of the brain, kidney, or soft tissues were analyzed for mutations and deletions of SMARCB1 by FISH, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), sequence analysis and high resolution Illumina 610K SNP-based oligonucleotide array studies. RESULTS: Thirty-five of 100 patients were found to have a germline SMARCB1 abnormality. These abnormalities included point and frameshift mutations, intragenic deletions and duplications, and larger deletions including regions both proximal and distal to SMARCB1. There were nine cases that demonstrated parent to child transmission of a mutated copy of SMARCB1. In eight of the nine cases, one or more family members were also diagnosed with rhabdoid tumor or schwannoma, and two of the eight families presented with multiple affected children in a manner consistent with gonadal mosaicism. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one-third of newly diagnosed patients with rhabdoid tumor have an underlying genetic predisposition to tumors due to a germline SMARCB1 alteration. Families may demonstrate incomplete penetrance and gonadal mosaicism, which must be considered when counseling families of patients with rhabdoid tumor.",cancer
"Primary hepatic sarcomas in children--a single-center experience over 19 years. BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Primary hepatic sarcomas are rare and account for about 13% of primary hepatic neoplasms. There are few reported series of pediatric hepatic sarcomas, and the aim was to review our experience. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of cases managed from 1988 to 2007 by the pediatric liver unit in Birmingham, UK, was conducted. RESULTS: Nineteen children were identified. These presented with sudden abdominal pain (n = 6), obstructive jaundice (n = 3), incidental mass (n = 3), and chronic pain/distension (n = 3). Vascular involvement was identified in 3, and 6 had pulmonary metastases. Three patients had primary resection, and 3 only a biopsy. Thirteen had a biopsy followed by chemotherapy and resection. Surgery included extended hepatectomy (n = 11), hepatectomy (n = 3), and nonanatomical resections (n = 2). There was 1 major intraoperative complication. Median inpatient stay was 7 days. One biliary leak developed 4 weeks postoperatively. Five of the 16 patients who underwent resection of the primary tumor died. Eleven were alive at a median follow-up of 3 years. CONCLUSION: This is a challenging group of patients. Local control remains pivotal to successful treatment. Good results can be achieved in a specialist center with multidisciplinary approach.",cancer
"The position of the lumbar vertebrae in relation to the intercrestal line. OBJECTIVE: To determine the position of the lumbar vertebrae in relation to the intercrestal line and variation in distance between the midpoint of the L(4/5) interspinous space and the intercrestal line in varying patients age groups of Thai people. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The present study was a retrospective analysis of the antero-posterior and lateral lumbosacral vertebral radiographs of 270 patients, varying patients' age from 20 to 80 years. Intercrestal line was drawn connecting the two highest points on the iliac crests of antero-posterior radiographs. The distance from the intercrestal line to the midpoint of the L(4/5) interspinous space and L(4/5) intervertebral space were measured. The results were statistically analysed by using ANOVA testing. RESULTS: The intercrestal line crosses the midline of the posterior part ofthe lumbar vertebral column between the upper half of L4 spinous process level and lower half of L5 spinous process level, most often at the lower half of L4 spinous process level (101 cases, 37.41%). This line crosses the anterior part of the lumbar vertebral column between the upper half of L4 body level and lower half of L5 body level, most often at the upper half of L5 body level (103 cases, 38.15%). Regarding distance from intercrestal line to the midpoint of the L(4/5), interspinous space in varying patient age groups, the intercrestal line was most frequently found above the L(4/5) interspinous space in most age group (average 5.73 +/- 5.72 mm; value p > 0.05 vs. 70-80 years). For the distance from intercrestal line to the midpoint of the L(4/5) intervertebral space in varying patient age groups, the intercrestal line was most frequently found below the L(4/5) intervertebral space in all age groups (average 6.60 +/- 6.97 mm; value p > 0.05 vs. 70-80 years). CONCLUSION: The intercrestal line crosses the posterior part of the lumbar vertebral column between the upper half of L4 spinous process level and lower half of L5 spinous process level, most often at the lower half of L4 spinous process level (37.41%) and at the L(4/5) interspinous space level (27.78%). This line crosses the anterior part of the lumbar vertebral column between the upper half of L4 body level and lower half of L5 body level, most often at the upper half of L5 body level (38.15%) and at the L(4/5) intervertebral space level (32.22%). The level of the intercrestal line tends to be high in elderly patients, neutral position and the intercrestal line by palpation tends to be identified at the higher level.",nocancer
"Higher levels of GATA3 predict better survival in women with breast cancer. The GATA family members are zinc finger transcription factors involved in cell differentiation and proliferation. GATA3 in particular is necessary for mammary gland maturation, and its loss has been implicated in breast cancer development. Our goal was to validate the ability of GATA3 expression to predict survival in breast cancer patients. Protein expression of GATA3 was analyzed on a high-density tissue microarray consisting of 242 cases of breast cancer. We associated GATA3 expression with patient outcomes and clinicopathologic variables. Expression of GATA3 was significantly increased in breast cancer, in situ lesions, and hyperplastic tissue compared with normal breast tissue. GATA3 expression decreased with increasing tumor grade. Low GATA3 expression was a significant predictor of disease-related death in all patients, as well as in subgroups of estrogen receptor-positive or low-grade patients. In addition, low GATA3 expression correlated with increased tumor size and estrogen and progesterone receptor negativity. GATA3 is an important predictor of disease outcome in breast cancer patients. This finding has been validated in a diverse set of populations. Thus, GATA3 expression has utility as a prognostic indicator in breast cancer.",cancer

Significant progress has been made in nanoscale drugs and delivery systems employing diverse chemical formulations to facilitate the rate of drug delivery and release from the human body. The biocompatible nanomaterials have been used in biological markers, contrast agents for biological imaging, healthcare products, pharmaceuticals, drug-delivery systems as well as in detection, diagnosis and treatment of various types of diseases. Nanomedicines offer delivery of potential drugs to human organs which were previously beyond reach of microscale drugs due to specific biological barriers. The nanoscale systems work as nanocarriers for the delivery of drugs. The nanocarriers are made of biocompatible and biodegradable materials such as synthetic proteins, peptides, lipids, polysaccharides, biodegradable polymers and fibers. This review article reports the recent developments in the field of nanomedicine covering biodegradable polymers, nanoparticles, cyclodextrin, dendrimeres, liposomes and lipid-based nanocarriers, nanofibers, nanowires and carbon nanotubes and their chemical functionalization for distribution to different organs, their solubility, surface, chemical and biological properties, stability and release systems.

Senechal's research in the West with English- and French-speaking children included positive relations of the development of literacy skills with home literacy experiences. There is a need to extend this research to other countries, especially in China where few studies have been done. This study examined relations of parental reports of formal and informal home literacy variables with Chinese children's vocabulary and written language development. Consistent with previous studies in the West, informal home literacy experiences were associated with Chinese children's vocabulary knowledge, and formal literacy experiences with reading skills. These findings fit previous research which distinguishes formal and informal literacy experiences in relation to children's performance on reading and language skills, and indicates reading to children is less effective for acquisition of print-specific skills.",nocancer

"Nursing recognition and response to signs of clinical deterioration. The suboptimal assessment of patients for signs of clinical deterioration and the subsequent response has led to the development of national guidelines and tools for tracking and responding to these situations. Such tools can provide guidance but ultimately the clinical skill, decision making and collaboration of professional practitioners determine optimal care. The use of track-and-trigger tools is insufficient to provide optimal care due to the many factors that affect patient journeys. The clinical knowledge and skill of nurses are important to this process and in achieving safe patient care.

"Selective inhibition of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) induces DNA damage and sensitizes transformed cells to anticancer agents. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is structurally and functionally unique among the 11 human zinc-dependent histone deacetylases. Here we show that chemical inhibition with the HDAC6-selective inhibitor tubacin significantly enhances cell death induced by the topoisomerase II inhibitors etoposide and doxorubicin and the pan-HDAC inhibitor SAHA (vorinostat) in transformed cells (LNCaP, MCF-7), an effect not observed in normal cells (human foreskin fibroblast cells). The inactive analogue of tubacin, nil-tubacin, does not sensitize transformed cells to these anticancer agents. Further, we show that down-regulation of HDAC6 expression by shRNA in LNCaP cells enhances cell death induced by etoposide, doxorubicin, and SAHA. Tubacin in combination with SAHA or etoposide is more potent than either drug alone in activating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in transformed cells, as evidenced by an increase in PARP cleavage and partial inhibition of this effect by the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk. HDAC6 inhibition with tubacin induces the accumulation of gammaH2AX, an early marker of DNA double-strand breaks. Tubacin enhances DNA damage induced by etoposide or SAHA as indicated by increased accumulation of gammaH2AX and activation of the checkpoint kinase Chk2. Tubacin induces the expression of DDIT3 (CHOP/GADD153), a transcription factor up-regulated in response to cellular stress. DDIT3 induction is further increased when tubacin is combined with SAHA. These findings point to mechanisms by which HDAC6-selective inhibition can enhance the efficacy of certain anti-cancer agents in transformed cells.",cancer
"Extended liver resection for polycystic liver disease can challenge liver transplantation. OBJECTIVE: In an attempt to refine the indications for liver resection (LR) for highly symptomatic polycystic liver disease (PLD), we focused on the characteristics, technical difficulties, postoperative outcome, and long-term follow-up of PLD patients who underwent either LR or liver transplantation (LT). METHODS: Since 1995, among 72 patients with massive hepatomegaly, 45 patients underwent LR associated with contralateral cyst fenestration whereas 27 underwent LT associated with simultaneous kidney transplantations in 23. The LR group was characterized by absence of end-stage renal insufficiency, absence of ascites, and better nutrition status. In the LR group, the volumetry of the spared noncystic parenchyma was preoperatively assessed whereas pathological analysis focused on fibrosis and vascular congestion. RESULTS: After LR, the mortality was nil and overall morbidity was 71%, including biliary leak in 20% and ascites in 42%. Persistent and massive ascites was observed in 8 patients who have undergone extensive resection and had significantly more frequently fibrosis on the analysis of their resected surgical specimens (P = 0.002). A volume of the remnant noncystic parenchyma less than 30% and the presence of vascular changes on the specimen were associated with higher risk of complications. The 5-year survival was 95% and among the 43 survivors, after a mean follow-up of 41 months, 36 (83%) patients stated that they were satisfied, with complete relief of symptoms in 30 (70%). After LT, the postoperative mortality was 15% and the overall morbidity was 85%, including 12 patients who required reoperation. Severe complications were more frequent in the presence of denutrition and preoperative ascites. The 5-year survival was 85% and after a mean follow-up of 36 months all survivors had complete relief of symptoms due to hepatomegaly. CONCLUSIONS: In case of massive hepatomegaly from PLD without end-stage renal failure, LR should be considered first when preserved remnant liver volume represents at least 30% of the total volume liver in the absence of vascular changes or fibrosis.",cancer
"Asymmetric cell division: recent developments and their implications for tumour biology. The ability of cells to divide asymmetrically is essential for generating diverse cell types during development. The past 10 years have seen tremendous progress in our understanding of this important biological process. We have learned that localized phosphorylation events are responsible for the asymmetric segregation of cell fate determinants in mitosis and that centrosomes and microtubules play important parts in this process. The relevance of asymmetric cell division for stem cell biology has added a new dimension to the field, and exciting connections between asymmetric cell division and tumorigenesis have begun to emerge.",cancer

"Surveillance for certain health behaviors among states and selected local areas - United States, 2008. PROBLEM: Chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and stroke) are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Data on health risk behaviors that increase the risk for chronic diseases and use of preventive practices are essential for the development, implementation, and evaluation of health promotion programs, policies, and intervention strategies to decrease or prevent the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Surveillance data from states and territories, selected metropolitan and micropolitan areas, and counties are vital components of these various prevention and intervention strategies. REPORTING PERIOD: January-December 2008 Description of the System: The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an ongoing, state-based, random-digit--dialed telephone survey of noninstitutionalized adults residing in the United States. BRFSS collects data on health risk behaviors, preventive health services and practices, and access to health care related to the leading causes of death and disability in the United States. This report presents results for 2008 for all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, 177 metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas (MMSAs), and 266 counties.

INTERPRETATION: The findings in this report indicate substantial variation in health-risk behaviors, chronic diseases and conditions, and use of preventive health-care services among U.S. adults at the state and territory, MMSA, and county level. The findings underscore the continued need for surveillance of health-risk behaviors, chronic diseases and conditions, and the use of preventive health services. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: Healthy People 2010 objectives have been established to monitor health behaviors and the use of preventive health services. Local and state health departments and federal agencies use BRFSS data to identify populations at high risk for certain health behaviors, chronic diseases and conditions, and to evaluate the use of preventive services. In addition, BRFSS data are used to direct, implement, monitor, and evaluate public health programs and policies that can lead to a reduction in morbidity and mortality from adverse effects of health-risk behaviors and subsequent chronic conditions.",nocancer
"Clinical and molecular determinants of survival in pancreatic cancer patients treated with second-line chemotherapy: results of an Italian/Swiss multicenter survey. BACKGROUND: Increased knowledge about the treatment of pancreatic cancer has influenced the management of locally advanced and metastatic disease. Nonetheless, prognosis remains dismal (24%, 1-year survival). The impact on overall survival (OS) of second-line therapy has not been clarified and the use of platinum salts and/or fluoropyrimidines is hotly debated. It is the hope that future treatment can be tailored to predict chemosensitivity in order to improve outcomes in patients with locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer. Since DNA-damaging agents could be one therapeutic option, a retrospective multicenter study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of salvage treatment with the hypothesis that levels of the DNA repair gene excision repair cross complementing 1 (ERCC1) could influence OS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a population of 160 patients treated with fluoropyrimidine-based second-line chemotherapy, expression levels of ERCC1 were determined by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In 108 patients with locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer treated with either fluoropyrimidines and platinum salts (group A=58) or fluoropyrimidines alone (group B=50), ERCC1 levels were correlated with OS, time to progression and response to chemotherapy. RESULTS: Median survival was significantly higher in group A with low ERCC1 levels [11.9 versus 9.9 months; p </= 0.05] (median follow-up 24 months). Moreover in the same group, a trend towards longer time to progression was observed. No differences in OS were observed when ERCC1 was studied (low versus high) in patients not treated with platinum salts. On multivariate analysis of pretreatment prognostic factors, ERCC1 emerged as an independent predictive factor for OS. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that ERCC1 may predict survival in pancreatic cancer patients treated by platinum and fluoropyrimidine as second-line chemotherapy.",cancer
"Immunohistochemical evaluation and lymph node metastasis in surgically staged endometrial carcinoma. OBJECTIVE: To assess the expression of immunohistochemical markers in surgically staged endometrial cancer patients. METHODS: We studied 107 cases of primary untreated endometrial carcinoma in which the p53, bcl-2, her-2/neu, Ki-67, estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) antigens were investigated by an immunohistochemical method. In the last 50 consecutive patients immunoreactivity for MMP-7 and MMP-26 was assessed as well. We evaluated the correlations among the immunohistochemical staining assessed by histoscore, and the age, grading, depth of invasion, stage of the neoplasia and extrauterine disease. RESULTS: Mean age was 65 years (range 34-88). All patients were submitted to total abdominal or modified radical vaginal hysterectomy plus bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy; p53, bcl-2, her-2/neu, Ki-67, MMP-7, MMP-26, estrogen and progesterone receptors were positive in 36 (43%), 71 (86%), 13 (16%), 80 (96%), 65 (78%), 80 (96%), 61 (73%) and 71 (86%) patients, respectively. p53 overexpression was found to be related to poor grade of differentiation and deep myometrial invasion. Immunostaining for ER was inversely related to the histopathological differentiation of the tumors. Decreased expression of PR was related to advanced stage, poor histopathologic differentiation and extrauterine spread of disease. CONCLUSION: The overexpression of p53 seems to indicate more malignant phenotype, while PR expression correlates with parameters of better clinical outcome.",cancer
"Sensitive determination of indomethacin in pharmaceuticals and urine by sequential injection analysis and optosensing. A selective and sensitive method based on coupling of sequential injection analysis (SIA) and optosensing was developed and applied to the determination of indomethacin in pharmaceutical and urinary samples. After alkaline hydrolysis, the fluorescent product generated from indomethacin is inserted in the flow system, transitorily retained on an active solid support (Sephadex QAE A-25) filling the flowcell, and monitored at 283/371 nm (lamda ex / lamda em). The system was calibrated for two sample volumes, 100 and 1000 microL. It showed a linear dynamic range of 0.5-6.5 ng/mL, with an LOD of 0.15 ng/mL and an RSD of 3.9% (n=10) when the highest sample volume was used. The proposed fluorometric SIA optosensor was applied to the determination of indomethacin in both pharmaceuticals and urine samples, and satisfactory results were obtained.",nocancer
"Inherent contradictions in the ego ideal. The author puts forth a concept of the ego ideal as the fantasied self that the child believes will bring it gratification and happiness. He then shows how the ego ideal's content evolves through the various stages of psychosexual development in accordance with its mission. A picture emerges of an ego ideal in inherent conflict because it is shaped by contradictory wishes, as well as contradictory fantasies of how to make those wishes come true. A section on romantic love points to a second contradiction within the ego ideal, beyond its contradictory content: a contradiction of aim.",nocancer
"Food effect on the pharmacokinetics of entecavir from dispersible tablets following oral administration in healthy Chinese volunteers. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of entecavir (CAS 142217-69-4) from dispersible tablets. METHODS: In an open-label, two-way crossover study, 12 healthy Chinese volunteers randomly received a single oral dose of 1 mg entecavir dispersible tablets under fasted and fed conditions. Blood samples were collected and determined for pharmacokinetic analyses. A solid phase extraction for sample preparation and a LC/MS method were developed and validated for determination of entecavir in human plasma. RESULTS: The absorption of entecavir from dispersible tablets was altered significantly with food intake, as evidenced by a decrease in Cm,, of 63%, a decrease in AUC0-t of 22%, and a delay in Tmax of 1.5 h. The calibration curve was linear from 0.2 to 25 ng/mL, with a lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of 0.2 ng/mL. CONCLUSION: Food intake has an obvious effect on the absorption of entecavir from dispersible tablets. It is better to take entecavir dispersible tablets on an empty stomach.",nocancer
"Obtaining data on comorbid diabetes among patients in a U.S. population-based tumor registry. Comorbid diabetes mellitus has been shown to be associated with outcomes among cancer patients, but population-based data have been limited to elderly patients through linkages between the US National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program database and Medicare databases. Reporting of comorbidity to the population-based Connecticut SEER registry is not required, but the extent of voluntary reporting of comorbid diabetes was assessed in this preliminary study. Of 15,145 Connecticut residents diagnosed at age 20+ years with invasive cancer in 2006, who were ascertained from 33 registry sources, 8688 (57.4%) from 21 sources were included in the analysis of comorbid diabetes. The prevalence of comorbid diabetes was 12.5%, and was lowest for patients with prostate cancer (8.5%) and highest for with liver-pancreas cancer (25.9%), consistent with the literature. Diabetes prevalence was substantial (9.5%) within the non-elderly subgroup aged 20-64 years at cancer diagnosis who comprised 45% of the 8688 patients. These results indicate an opportunity for future large-scale studies of the impact of diabetes on outcomes among all newly diagnosed cancer patients (both non-elderly and elderly) in the Connecticut SEER registry and other US central cancer registries.",cancer
"Comparative findings of oncogenic cervical risk and its follow-up in two different periods 1982-1999 and 2000-2007. During the 2000-2007 period, my group and I reviewed the cases of 3,036 patients undergoing routine colposcopies, cytology and cervical biopsies for those cases that merited it, and a 20% increase was found in lesions defined as dysplasias as compared with those found in the studies of the previous century. This is something that reaffirms the association with HPV by 96.5% versus 80% the last century. In relation to HPV infection, we found that the ""pure"" form was not only reached but rather surpassed by the findings associated with cancer and dysplasia in the years 2005-2006, a behavior considered irregular as compared to the usual. The majority of the patients were guided toward conservative local treatments, among which cryosurgery and cauterization prevailed as choices, and their evolution resulted in an 81% cure (considered as destruction of the lesion and negativity of the cytology and eventual biopsy). It can be concluded that the high vulnerability of the virus, in spite of its great aggressiveness as an oncogenic risk (OR) to a cervical-uterine lesion, can be supported by the high degree of lesions diagnosed by OR.",cancer
"Human papillomavirus (HPV)-type distribution in relation to oral contraceptive use in women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, Durban, South Africa. OBJECTIVE: To determine HPV-type distribution among women with cervical dysplasia in relation to oral contraceptive usage. METHODS: Prospective cross-sectional study of four groups of patients according to oral contraceptive usage: non-users, users of less than five years duration, users of between five years and ten years, and users of more than ten years duration. Swabs of the cervix were analysed for HPV DNA using the polymerase chain reaction method. RESULTS: A total of 124 women were recruited for the study. There were 75 patients who were HIV-infected (seroprevalence 61%). There were 102 patients who were HPV positive (82%), of which 79 patients had high-risk HPV DNA (78%). In terms of the four oral contraceptive groups, high-risk HPV DNA was detected in 70% (n = 21), 79% (n = 22), 90% (n = 21) and 71% (n = 15) of patient, respectively. The odds of having HPV DNA was six times higher for the combination of contraceptive users of less than five years duration/non-users (OR 5.9, 95% CI: 1.87-18.77). There was no change when adjustment was made for age (OR 6.1, 95% CI: 1.9-19.4). HPV DNA type 16 and/or 18 was present in a total of 21 patients (49%) (non-contraceptive users and users < 5 years duration) versus 15 patients (42%) (oral contraceptive users of more than 5 years duration) (p = 0.524). HPV type 16 was the commonest HPV type detected (20.2%) and HPV type 58 was the next commonest hihg-risk HPV type (16.1%). HPV types 58 and 33 were detected in a much greater percentage of our population and HPV 16 in a much smaller percentage of our population compared with a non-South African population. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study demonstrate an interesting distribution of HPV types in a South African population.",cancer
"Personality functioning in patients with a progressive course of multiple sclerosis. This study intended to describe general personality functioning in patients with a progressive course of multiple sclerosis. 55 consecutive rehabilitation inpatients with progressive course of multiple sclerosis were assessed with a multimethod test battery: the Expanded Disability Status Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale, and the Rorschach Test administered and scored with Comprehensive System. The control group comprised 55 healthy participants with similar sociodemographic characteristics. Specific differences were found for both cognitive and affective aspects, as the patients with progressive course of multiple sclerosis had less positive self-image, less effective mediation processing, and an affective approach to reality. Present data illustrated the usefulness of examining patients with a progressive course of multiple sclerosis to identify abilities and difficulties in cognitive and affective patterns, and support better adaptation to relationships and the environment.",nocancer
"Using activated carbon nanoparticles to decrease the genotoxicity and teratogenicity of anticancer therapeutic agents. One of the key obstacles against the success in cancer chemotherapy is the toxic and side effects of the chemotherapeutic agents. The avoidance of these toxic and side effects will greatly improve the therapeutic effects of anticancer drugs while decrease the pains of the patients. Here we show that activated carbon nanoparticles (ACNP), one of the mesoporous nanoparticles, can decrease the genotoxicity and teratogenicity of mitomycin C (MMC). To study the effects of ACNP on genotoxicity and teratogenicity of MMC, methods of PCE micronucleus test, Chinese hamster lung cell chromosome aberration experiment and rat teratogenicity were employed to observe the differences in genotoxicity and teratogenicity between ACNP-adsorbed MMC (ACNP-MMC) and free MMC. Results demonstrated that free MMC 0.16-5.0 microg/kg significantly increased the positive rate of PCE micronucleus test, the chromosome aberration rate and rat teratogenecity, but ACNP-MMC did not increased these heredity and reproduction toxicological indexes in a dose range of 0.625-10.0 microg/kg. From these results, it can be concluded that ACNP-MMC have significant effects to decrease the genotoxicity and teratogenicity effects of MMC. These results will have a considerable impact on the strategy of anticancer chemotherapy.",cancer
"Seasonal influenza and 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccination coverage among pregnant women--10 states, 2009-10 influenza season. Because pregnant women are at increased risk for severe disease associated with influenza infection, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices have recommended seasonal influenza vaccination for women while pregnant, regardless of trimester. In 2009, a novel strain of influenza A (H1N1) virus was identified, and pregnant women also were found to be at greater risk for influenza-related complications from this new virus. As a result, during the 2009--10 influenza season, two separate influenza vaccines were recommended to pregnant women: inactivated trivalent 2009--10 seasonal vaccine and influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine. To estimate influenza vaccination coverage among pregnant women during the 2009--10 influenza season, CDC analyzed data from 10 states from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS). This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which determined that vaccination coverage for pregnant women among the 10 states combined was 50.7% for seasonal influenza and 46.6% for 2009 H1N1. In addition, women to whom vaccination was offered or recommended by their health-care provider were significantly more likely to report being vaccinated against seasonal influenza (relative risk [RR] = 3.3) and 2009 H1N1 (RR = 10.1). These results indicate substantially higher influenza vaccination coverage among pregnant women than has been reported for previous influenza seasons and support previous findings that receipt of influenza vaccination can be influenced greatly by health-care providers offering or recommending influenza vaccination.",nocancer
"Metronomic oral cyclophosphamide prednisolone chemotherapy is an effective treatment for metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer after docetaxel failure. BACKGROUND: There is currently no standard of treatment for patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) after failure of docetaxel-based chemotherapy. The purpose of this study was to assess the anticancer activity and tolerance of metronomic cyclophosphamide prednisolone combination in this setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 2005 to 2010, patients with HRPC who failed at least docetaxel-based chemotherapy were proposed metronomic cyclophosphamide-prednisolone regimen, and were prospectively registered. Twenty-three patients received 50 mg cyclophosphamide and 10 mg prednisolone per os daily until disease progression. Treatment tolerance and efficacy on PSA decrease and pain were studied. RESULTS: Metronomic cyclophosphamide prednisolone was safe, well tolerated, and demonstrated interesting clinical activity, yielding a prostate specific antigen decrease by >/=50% in 26% of patients and decrease by >/=30% in 48% of patients, but also favorable palliative effects on pain in 43% of patients. The median progression-free survival was 6 months (95% CI: 4-8 months) and the median overall survival was 11 months (95% CI: 7-19 months). CONCLUSION: For this patient population, low dose metronomic cyclophosphamide prednisolone might be a viable alternative. Its convenient oral administration, low cost, and lack of toxicity justify further studies alone, or in combination with other agents in HRPC patients.",cancer
"Nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) refers to a prolonged seizure that manifests primarily as altered mental status as opposed to the dramatic convulsions seen in generalized tonic-clonic status epilepticus. There are 2 main types of NCSE, each of which has a different presentation, cause, and expected outcome. In the first type of NCSE, patients present with confusion or abnormal behavior, suggesting the diagnosis of absence status epilepticus (ASE) or complex partial status epilepticus (CPSE). The second type of NCSE (subtle status epilepticus [SSE]) must be considered in comatose patients who present after a prolonged generalized tonic-clonic seizure and who may have only subtle motor manifestations of a seizure, such as facial or hand twitchings. Whereas the morbidity and mortality in patients with prolonged ASE or CPSE is low, the mortality associated with SSE can exceed 30% if the seizure duration is greater than 60 minutes.",nocancer

"Results of multidisciplinary therapy of squamous cell carcinoma of the buccal mucosa at Srinagarind Hospital, Thailand. OBJECTIVE: Review the clinical presentation and treatment of buccal carcinoma and compare it to the results of treatment as per survival rate. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The authors reviewed the medical records of newly diagnosed seen between 1995 and 2005 at the Division of Plastic Surgery and the Department of Radiotherapy, Srinagarind Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University Patients previously treated elsewhere or those whose lesions secondarily involved the buccal mucosa were excluded. RESULTS: The authors reviewed the medical records of 107 buccal carcinoma patients (94 females and 13 males) averaging 67 years of age. The 5-year survival rates of patients with Stage I (5.6%), 11 (6.5%), III (12.1%), and IVa (75.7%) were 67%, 43%, 47%, and 26%, respectively. A combined modality treatment (surgery and radiation or chemotherapy) was used to treat the advanced stage (III and IV) patients. The rate of incomplete therapy was high (47.78%). In the group that completed the protocol (i.e., neoadjuvant, surgery, and post operative radiation), there were five patients for whom the 5-year survival seemed higher than the patients who followed the standard treatment of surgery and post-operative radiation but it was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The treatment of buccal carcinoma requires a multidisciplinary team approach because most of the patients are elderly and present with an advanced stage. If treatment continues through to completion of the protocol, the survival rate would increase.",cancer
"Venous thromboembolism after spine surgery: changes of the fibrin monomer complex and D-dimer level during the perioperative period. OBJECT: The goal of this study was to determine the incidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) after spine surgery. Another purpose was to clarify the rapid changes of the fibrin monomer complex (FMC) and D-dimer levels during the perioperative period of spine surgery for early diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE). METHODS: The participants were 72 patients who underwent spine surgery between September 2007 and March 2008. The FMC and D-dimer levels were measured 6 times: 1) at induction of general anesthesia; 2) just after implantation or during surgery; 3) immediately following surgery; 4) 1 day after surgery; 5) 3 days postsurgery; and 6) 7 days after surgery. All patients received mechanical prophylaxis, including compression stockings and intermittent pneumatic compression devices, and all were examined with duplex ultrasonography assessments of both lower extremities and with lung perfusion scintigraphy 7-10 days after surgery. If DVT or PE was suspected, the patient underwent multidetector CT venography. RESULTS: There were no patients with clinical signs of DVT and PE, but 6 (8.3%) showed VTE, among whom 5 had DVT and 3 had PE. Patients with VTE had significantly higher FMC levels 1 day after surgery, compared with those without VTE (55.9 +/- 17.2 mug/ml vs 11.1 +/- 2.89 mug/ml; p < 0.01). Patients with VTE had significantly higher D-dimer levels 7 days postsurgery, compared with those without VTE (12.5 +/- 2.95 mug/ml vs 4.3 +/- 0.39 mug/ml; p < 0.01). Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that the FMC result was more useful than the D-dimer assay for diagnosis of VTE. When the cutoff value was set to 20.8 mug/ml for FMC, sensitivity was 100% and specificity was 86.3%. CONCLUSIONS: In this study the prevalence of VTE after spine surgery was 8.3%. The FMC measured 1 day after spine surgery is considered to be useful as an indicator of VTE.",cancer
"Implications of bone metastases and the benefits of bone-targeted therapy. Several cancers, including those originating in the breast, prostate, and lung, exhibit a propensity to metastasize to bone, resulting in debilitating skeletal complications. These sequelae, such as intractable pain, pathologic fractures, spinal compression, and hypercalcemia, greatly erode the patients' quality of life. Bisphosphonates, a class of antiresorptive drugs, are now the mainstay of the treatment of skeletal-related events in myeloma bone disease and many solid cancers with bone metastases. Current evidence indicates that newer-generation nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates, particularly zoledronic acid, are potent inhibitors of bone resorption. In addition, increased understanding of the pathogenesis of bone metastasis has resulted in the development of several bone-targeted therapies including a monoclonal antibody targeting the receptor activator of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB ligand (RANKL). In this review, clinical evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of currently available bone-targeted therapies including bisphosphonates and anti-RANKL monoclonal antibody in the treatment of bone metastasis due to breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, and multiple myeloma bone disease will be summarized.",cancer
"Vital signs: HIV testing and diagnosis among adults--United States, 2001-2009. BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a major cause of morbidity, mortality, and health-care expenditures in the United States. HIV testing and linkage to care are essential to identify persons early in their course of infection to prevent progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and death, and to reduce transmission. METHODS: CDC used 2001-2009 data from the National Health Interview Survey to estimate percentages of persons aged 18--64 years who reported ever being tested for HIV in the United States. Data from the National HIV Surveillance System were used to estimate numbers, percentages, and rates of HIV diagnoses, AIDS diagnoses, and late diagnoses of HIV infection (defined as an AIDS diagnosis made <12 months from an initial HIV diagnosis) for persons diagnosed with HIV infection during 2001--2008 and reported to CDC through June 2009; these were used to determine populations and regions most affected by HIV and AIDS, late diagnoses, and trends in late diagnoses over time. RESULTS: The percentage of persons aged 18-64 years ever tested for HIV was stable at approximately 40% from 2001 to 2006, increasing to 45.0% in 2009. The percentage of persons with late diagnoses of HIV infection was stable at approximately 37% from 2001 to 2004, decreasing to 32.3% by 2007 (most recent data available). In the 37 states with mature HIV reporting systems in 2007, the percentage of persons diagnosed late ranged from 25.0% to 47.2%. In 2008, most HIV diagnoses, by race/ethnicity, were among blacks or African Americans (51.2%) and, by transmission category, were among non-drug-injecting men reporting male-to-male sexual contact (55.0%). AIDS diagnosis rates were highest in the South and Northeast census regions and in the most populated states. CONCLUSIONS: The number of persons in the United States who report ever being tested for HIV is increasing, and fewer persons are being diagnosed late in their infection. However, nearly one third of diagnoses still occur late. Increased testing efforts are needed, particularly among populations that account for most HIV diagnoses. IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICE: All health-care providers should expand routine HIV screening so that all adults are tested. Members of populations with higher rates of HIV diagnoses and living in geographic areas with high HIV prevalence should be screened more frequently than others. Persons likely to be at high risk for HIV infection (e.g., gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men) should be tested at least annually. Public health officials should emphasize the importance of HIV testing and allocate resources to increase testing among populations with the highest rates of HIV diagnoses.",nocancer
"The anterior extraperitoneal approach to the rare presacral/ retroperitoneal schwannoma. Presacral/retroperitoneal schwannomas are extremely unusual and their surgical approach is challenging. Various surgical approaches have been proposed. Here we describe our experience with the anterior extraperitoneal approach for the Type 3 presacral/retroperitoneal schwannoma. A 33-year-old woman presented with a history of infertility and a presacral/retroperitoneal mass. The patient underwent abdominal/pelvic CT and MRI that demonstrated presence of a solid, well circumscribed Type 3 presacral/retroperitoneal schwannoma. The anterior extraperitoneal approach was successfully used to remove the presacral/retroperitoneal schwannoma. The histopathological evaluation confirmed the preoperative diagnosis. The anterior extraperitoneal approach is helpful as an alternative approach in the surgical management of benign Type 3 presacral/retroperitoneal schwannomas (Fig. 4, Ref. 15).",cancer
"Service uptake and performance of the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) programme in Ibadan, Nigeria. The Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) programme in the University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan has been in existence for more than five years and has scaled up to other sites. The study evaluated the service uptake and performance of the programme using national key indicators. Antenatal and delivery records of women enrolled between July 2002 and June 2007 were reviewed. A total of 51952 women attended first antenatal visits and received HIV pre-test counselling. Of these, 51614 (99.5%) accepted HIV test and 49134 (95.2%) returned for their results. Out of the tested patients, 2152 (4.2%) were identified to be HIV positive. Partners of positive patients accepting HIV testing were 361 (16.7%) with 87 (18.6%) testing positive. There were a total of 942 deliveries out of which 39.2% of the mothers and 95.2% of the babies respectively received ARV prophylaxis. In all, 85.8% (788/918) of the mothers opted for formula as the method of infant feeding. Out of the 303 babies eligible for ELISA testing, 68.3% reported for the test and 17 (8.7%) tested positive. There has been progress in the programme, reflected in the increase in the number of new clients accessing the PMTCT service. However, partner testing and follow up of mother-infant pairs remain formidable challenges that deserve special attention.",nocancer
"Ovarian metastasis of a primary renal cell carcinoma: case report and review of literature. Ovarian metastases from renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are very rare, with only 23 cases reported in the literature. We report a case of 54-year-old women who developed bilateral ovarian metastasis 39 months after diagnosis of clear cell carcinoma. Total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was carried out. Subsequently she was treated with sunitinib and her disease stabilized. She is still alive four years after diagnosis of the renal primary, and disease has stabilized on sunitinib. We conclude that, although rare, the possibility of metastatic RCC should be considered in the differential diagnosis of clear cell tumors of the ovary. Due to therapeutic and prognostic implications, it is very important to differentiate if the tumor is a primary ovarian tumor or a metastasis from a renal cell carcinoma. Early diagnosis of this rare metastatic tumor results in prompt treatment and prolonged patient survival.",cancer

Metastatic adenocarcinoma after intramedullary fixation of a tibial fracture: A report of two cases. We present two cases of metastatic lung cancer which occurred at the site of a previously united tibial fracture. Both patients were treated with a locked intramedullary nail. The patients presented with metastases at the site of their initial fracture approximately 16 and 13 months after injury respectively. We discuss this unusual presentation and review the relevant literature. We are unaware of any previous reports of a metastatic tumour occurring at the site of an orthopaedic implant used to stabilise a non-pathological fracture. These cases demonstrate the similar clinical presentation of infection and malignancy: a diagnosis which should always be considered in such patients.,cancer
"Association of surgical care improvement project infection-related process measure compliance with risk-adjusted outcomes: implications for quality measurement. BACKGROUND: Facility-level process measure adherence is being publicly reported. However, the association between measure adherence and surgical outcomes is not well-established. Our objective was to determine the degree to which Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP) process measures are associated with American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) risk-adjusted outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: This cross-sectional study included hospitals participating in the ACS NSQIP and SCIP (n = 200). ACS NSQIP outcomes (30-day overall morbidity, serious morbidity, surgical site infections [SSI], and mortality) and adherence to SCIP SSI-related process measures (from the Hospital Compare database) were collected from January 1, 2008, through December 31, 2008. Hospital-level correlation coefficients between compliance with 4 process measures (ie, antibiotic administration within 1 hour before incision [SCIP-1]; appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis [SCIP-2]; antibiotic discontinuation within 24 hours after surgery [SCIP-3]; and appropriate hair removal [SCIP 6]) and 4 risk-adjusted outcomes were calculated. Regression analyses estimated the contribution of process measure adherence to risk-adjusted outcomes. RESULTS: Of 211 ACS NSQIP hospitals, 95% had data reported by Hospital Compare. Depending on the measure, hospital-level compliance ranged from 60% to 100%. Of the 16 correlations, 15 demonstrated nonsignificant associations with risk-adjusted outcomes. The exception was the relationship between SCIP-2 and SSI (p = 0.004). SCIP-1 demonstrated an intriguing but nonsignificant relationship with SSI (p = 0.08) and overall morbidity (p = 0.08). Although adherence to SCIP-2 was a significant predictor of risk-adjusted SSI (p < 0.0001) and overall morbidity (p < 0.0001), inclusion of compliance for SCIP-1 and SCIP-2 caused only slight improvement in model quality. CONCLUSIONS: Better adherence to infection-related process measures over the observed range was not significantly associated with better outcomes with one exception. Different measures of quality might be needed for surgical infection.",nocancer
"Peripheral pulmonary papillary adenocarcinoma with prominent cilia: report of a rare case that was difficult to diagnose preoperatively. BACKGROUND: In pulmonary cytology, the existence of cilia is considered cytologic evidence of benign cells because it is generally considered that cilia could not be identified by light microscopic observation of pulmonary adenocarcinoma. However, we encountered a rare exceptional case of pulmonary adenocarcinoma with cilia. CASE: A 55-year-old woman with bloody sputum was admitted. Computed tomography revealed a lung tumor. Although transbronchial brushing cytology showed atypical cells suggestive of malignancy, some atypical cells had cilia, so we could not diagnose them as cancer cells. After antibiotic therapy, the tumor was surgically excised. Imprint cytology showed similar atypical ciliated cells. Histologically, the tumor was diagnosed as papillary adenocarcinoma with cilia and diffuse pleural dissemination was observed. Electron microscopic observation identified cilia. The patient died due to aggravation of cancer, which was confirmed on autopsy. CONCLUSION: This rare case of peripheral pulmonary papillary adenocarcinoma with cilia could not be diagnosed as cancer cell on cytology. Pulmonary papillary adenocarcinoma with cilia should be considered in the differential diagnosis of atypical cells in pulmonary cytology.",cancer
"Integrated motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioural therapy for people with psychosis and comorbid substance misuse: randomised controlled trial. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of integrated motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioural therapy in addition to standard care for patients with psychosis and a comorbid substance use problem. DESIGN: Two centre, open, rater blind randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Secondary care in the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: 327 patients with a clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, or schizoaffective disorder and a diagnosis of dependence on or misuse of drugs, alcohol, or both according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition. INTERVENTION: The intervention was integrated motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioural therapy plus standard care, which was compared with standard care alone. Phase one of therapy-""motivation building""-concerns engaging the patient, then exploring and resolving ambivalence for change in substance use. Phase two-""action""-supports and facilitates change using cognitive behavioural approaches. Up to 26 therapy sessions were delivered over one year. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was death from any cause or admission to hospital in the 12 months after completion of therapy. Secondary outcomes were frequency and amount of substance use (assessed using the timeline followback method), readiness to change, perceived negative consequences of use, psychotic symptom ratings, number and duration of relapses, and global assessment of functioning and deliberate self harm at 12 and 24 months, with additional timeline followback assessments at 6 and 18 months. Analysis was by intention to treat and robust treatment effect estimates were produced. RESULTS: 327 participants were randomly allocated to either the intervention (n=164) or treatment as usual (n=163). At 24 months, 326 (99.7%) were assessed on the primary outcome and 246 (75.2%) on the main secondary outcomes. Treatment had no beneficial effect on hospital admissions or death during follow-up, with 23.3% (38/163) of the therapy group and 20.2% (33/163) of controls deceased or admitted (adjusted odds ratio 1.16, 95% confidence interval 0.68 to 1.99; P=0.579). Therapy had no effect on the frequency of substance use or the perceived negative consequences of misuse, but did have a statistically significant effect on amount used per substance using day (adjusted ORs for main substance 1.50, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.09; P=0.016; and all substances 1.48, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.05; P=0.017). Treatment had a statistically significant effect on readiness to change use at 12 months (adjusted OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.26 to 3.31; P=0.004) that was not maintained at 24 months (0.78, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.28; P=0.320). There were no effects of treatment on clinical outcomes such as relapses, psychotic symptoms, functioning, and self harm. CONCLUSIONS: Integrated motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioural therapy for people with psychosis and substance misuse do not improve outcome in terms of hospitalisation, symptom outcomes, or functioning. This approach does reduce the amount of substance used for at least one year after completion of therapy. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials: ISRCTN14404480.",nocancer
"Acute and sustained effects of cognitive emotion regulation in major depression. Dysfunctional regulation of mood and emotion is a key component of major depressive disorder and leads to sustained negative feelings. Using functional MRI (fMRI), we investigated the temporal dynamics of emotion regulation in patients with major depressive disorder and in healthy controls, testing for acute and sustained neural effects of active emotion regulation. Moderately depressed individuals (n = 17) and never-depressed healthy control subjects (n = 17) underwent fMRI during performance of an active cognitive emotion regulation task while viewing emotionally arousing pictures. In a second task, completed 15 min later, subjects were presented with the same stimuli in a passive viewing task. Whole-brain analyses and connectivity measures were used to determine acute and sustained effects of emotion regulation on brain activation and coupling between regions. On the group level, patients were able to downregulate negative emotions and corresponding amygdala activation, but this ability decreased with increasing symptom severity. Moreover, only healthy control subjects showed a sustained regulation effect in the amygdala after a 15 min delay, whereas depressed patients did not. Finally, patients exhibited diminished prefrontal activation and reduced prefrontolimbic coupling during active regulation. Although emotion regulation capacity in medicated depressive patients appears to be preserved depending on symptom severity, the effect is not sustained. Correlational analyses provide evidence that this diminished sustained-regulation effect might be related to reduced prefrontal activation during regulation.",nocancer
"Most patients with asymptomatic, disease-free third molars elect extraction over retention as their preferred treatment. PURPOSE: To answer the clinical question, ""Among patients presenting for evaluation of their third molars (M3s), do those who choose M3 extraction, compared with those who choose M3 retention, differ in important demographic, clinical, anatomic, or radiographic ways?"" MATERIALS AND METHODS: The investigators implemented a retrospective cohort study and enrolled a sample composed of patients presenting for M3 evaluation. The primary predictor variable was the clinician's assessment of M3 status categorized as asymptomatic, disease free (Sx-/D-); asymptomatic, disease present (Sx-/D+); symptomatic, disease free (Sx+/D-); and symptomatic, disease present (Sx+/D+). The secondary predictor variable was treatment recommendation grouped as extraction, retention, or patient choice. The primary outcome variable was the subject's treatment decision: extract or retain M3s. Data analyses were performed using bivariate and multiple regression methods. RESULTS: The study sample comprised 249 subjects (855 M3s) with a mean age of 27.3 +/- 10.4 (median = 25.0) years. Of the 855 M3s evaluated, 37.3% were Sx-/D-, 0.6% were Sx+/D-, 51.1% were Sx-/D+, and 11.0% were Sx+/D+. The treatment recommendations were retention (6.5%), extraction (55.7%), or patient choice (37.8%). Subjects chose M3 extraction 82.1% of the time. In the adjusted multiple logistic regression model, increasing age, presence of Sx-/D- M3s, and a treatment recommendation of M3 retention were factors statistically (P < .05) associated with subject treatment choice of M3 retention. CONCLUSION: When offered the choice of retention or extraction, most patients (60%) with asymptomatic, disease-free M3s elected for extraction. When M3 symptoms or disease were present, more than 95% of patients chose extraction as the preferred treatment.",nocancer

"Brentuximab vedotin (SGN-35) for relapsed CD30-positive lymphomas. BACKGROUND: Hodgkin's lymphoma and anaplastic large-cell lymphoma are the two most common tumors expressing CD30. Previous attempts to target the CD30 antigen with monoclonal-based therapies have shown minimal activity. To enhance the antitumor activity of CD30-directed therapy, the antitubulin agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) was attached to a CD30-specific monoclonal antibody by an enzyme-cleavable linker, producing the antibody-drug conjugate brentuximab vedotin (SGN-35). METHODS: In this phase 1, open-label, multicenter dose-escalation study, we administered brentuximab vedotin (at a dose of 0.1 to 3.6 mg per kilogram of body weight) every 3 weeks to 45 patients with relapsed or refractory CD30-positive hematologic cancers, primarily Hodgkin's lymphoma and anaplastic large-cell lymphoma. Patients had received a median of three previous chemotherapy regimens (range, one to seven), and 73% had undergone autologous stem-cell transplantation. RESULTS: The maximum tolerated dose was 1.8 mg per kilogram, administered every 3 weeks. Objective responses, including 11 complete remissions, were observed in 17 patients. Of 12 patients who received the 1.8-mg-per-kilogram dose, 6 (50%) had an objective response. The median duration of response was at least 9.7 months. Tumor regression was observed in 36 of 42 patients who could be evaluated (86%). The most common adverse events were fatigue, pyrexia, diarrhea, nausea, neutropenia, and peripheral neuropathy. CONCLUSIONS: Brentuximab vedotin induced durable objective responses and resulted in tumor regression for most patients with relapsed or refractory CD30-positive lymphomas in this phase 1 study. Treatment was associated primarily with grade 1 or 2 (mild-to-moderate) toxic effects. (Funded by Seattle Genetics; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00430846.).",cancer
"Anterolateral thigh free flap for complex composite central chest wall defect reconstruction with extrathoracic microvascular anastomoses. BACKGROUND: Complex central chest wall resection defects present a challenging management problem for both thoracic and reconstructive surgeons. Although most chest wall defects can be repaired using local and regional flaps, more complicated cases require increasingly sophisticated techniques such as microsurgical free tissue transfer. This study reviews a single plastic surgeon's experience over a 4-year period with complex chest wall reconstruction using the anterolateral thigh free flap. METHODS: Five female patients who underwent the above procedure between 2004 and 2007 were reviewed retrospectively. The clinicopathologic details recorded included histologic diagnosis, extent of resection, type of skeletal defect, flap size, receipt vessels, ischemia time, and flap/donor-site complications. Skeletal reconstruction used methylmethacrylate/polypropylene mesh sandwich prostheses. RESULTS: The indications for surgery were metastatic breast cancer (n=3), advanced primary fibrosarcoma (n=1), and extensive radionecrosis (n=1). The average surface area of the chest wall resection was 197 cm (range, 156 to 270 cm). The four patients who underwent partial sternectomy and rib resection required skeletal reconstruction and subsequent ventilatory support postoperatively in the intensive care unit. The mean anterolateral thigh flap size was 188 cm (range, 143 to 252 cm); none of the donor sites was skin grafted. There was 100 percent flap survival, and the prostheses remained fully covered in all cases after a mean follow-up of 16 months (range, 5 to 28 months). No major complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The anterolateral thigh free flap is a safe and reliable option for reconstructing complicated composite chest wall defects. It therefore provides a practical alternative when regional pedicled flap options are unavailable or inadequate.",cancer
"Independent association of lobular involution and mammographic breast density with breast cancer risk. BACKGROUND: Lobular involution, or age-related atrophy of breast lobules, is inversely associated with breast cancer risk, and mammographic breast density (MBD) is positively associated with breast cancer risk. METHODS: To evaluate whether lobular involution and MBD are independently associated with breast cancer risk in women with benign breast disease, we performed a nested cohort study among women (n = 2666) with benign breast disease diagnosed at Mayo Clinic between January 1, 1985, and December 31, 1991 and a mammogram available within 6 months of the diagnosis. Women were followed up for an average of 13.3 years to document any breast cancer incidence. Lobular involution was categorized as none, partial, or complete; parenchymal pattern was classified using the Wolfe classification as N1 (nondense), P1, P2 (ductal prominence occupying <25%, or >25% of the breast, respectively), or DY (extremely dense). Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess associations of lobular involution and MBD with breast cancer risk were estimated using adjusted Cox proportional hazards model. All tests of statistical significance were two-sided. RESULTS: After adjustment for MBD, having no or partial lobular involution was associated with a higher risk of breast cancer than having complete involution (none: HR of breast cancer incidence = 2.62, 95% CI = 1.39 to 4.94; partial: HR of breast cancer incidence = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.03 to 2.53; P(trend) = .002). Similarly, after adjustment for involution, having dense breasts was associated with higher risk of breast cancer than having nondense breasts (for DY: HR of breast cancer incidence = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.03 to 2.73; for P2: HR of breast cancer incidence = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.20 to 3.21; for P1: HR of breast cancer incidence = 1.23, 95% CI = 0.67 to 2.26; P(trend) = .02). Having a combination of no involution and dense breasts was associated with higher risk of breast cancer than having complete involution and nondense breasts (HR of breast cancer incidence = 4.08, 95% CI = 1.72 to 9.68; P = .006). CONCLUSION: Lobular involution and MBD are independently associated with breast cancer incidence; combined, they are associated with an even greater risk for breast cancer.",cancer

"Risk factors for lymphedema in a prospective breast cancer survivorship study: the Pathways Study. OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) during the early survivorship period as well as demographic, lifestyle, and clinical factors associated with BCRL development. DESIGN: The Pathways Study, a prospective cohort study of breast cancer survivors with a mean follow-up time of 20.9 months. SETTING: Kaiser Permanente Northern California medical care program. PARTICIPANTS: We studied 997 women diagnosed from January 9, 2006, through October 15, 2007, with primary invasive breast cancer and who were at least 21 years of age at diagnosis, had no history of any cancer, and spoke English, Spanish, Cantonese, or Mandarin. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Clinical indication for BCRL as determined from outpatient or hospitalization diagnostic codes, outpatient procedural codes, and durable medical equipment orders. RESULTS: A clinical indication for BCRL was found in 133 women (13.3%), with a mean time to diagnosis of 8.3 months (range, 0.7-27.3 months). Being African American (hazard ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-3.72) or more educated (P for trend = .03) was associated with an increased risk of BCRL. Removal of at least 1 lymph node (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.07) was associated with an increased risk, yet no significant association was observed for type of lymph node surgery. Being obese at breast cancer diagnosis was suggestive of an elevated risk (hazard ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.88-2.31). CONCLUSIONS: In a large cohort study, BCRL occurs among a substantial proportion of early breast cancer survivors. Our findings agree with those of previous studies on the increased risk of BCRL with removal of lymph nodes and being obese, but they point to a differential risk according to race or ethnicity.",cancer
"Childhood non-Hodgkin's lymphoma arising as a complication early in the course of Crohn's disease.

This report describes a case of gastrointestinal lymphoma in a 12-year-old boy with Crohn's disease of one-year duration that initially manifested as an abdominal mass. Although Crohn's disease may present as a palpable abdominal mass, changing symptomatology should always warrant consideration of developing lymphoma complicating inflammatory bowel diseases. It is our hope that this case report gives the clinician an insight into the possibility of lymphoma development, even in the early course of the disease, and stresses the importance of obtaining a reliable histological diagnosis whenever possible.",cancer
"Varicella seroprevalence in the U.S.: data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999-2004. OBJECTIVE: We estimated the varicella seroprevalence among the U.S. population aged 6-49 years based on retested National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) specimens collected between 1999 and 2004--originally tested using a method unsuitable for detecting vaccine-induced immunity--and compared it with historical estimates. METHODS: We performed a confirmatory test suitable for detecting vaccine-induced immunity on all available specimens from 6- to 19-year-olds who originally tested negative (n = 633), and on 297 randomly selected specimens that had tested positive. Retest results superseded original results for determining seroprevalence. We assessed seroprevalence for the entire sample aged 6-49 years (n = 16,050) by participant demographic characteristics and compared it with historical estimates (NHANES 1988-1994). RESULTS: The percentage of false-negative results for the original test was higher for specimens from younger children (6-11 years of age: 27.5%; 12-19 years of age: 13.3%) and for specimens collected most recently (2001-2004: 26.0%; 1999-2000: 12.6%). The age-adjusted rate of varicella seroprevalence for 1999-2004 was 93.6% for 6- to 19-year-olds and 98.0% for adults aged 20-49 years compared with 90.0% and 98.1%, respectively, for 1988-1994. We found an increase in seropositivity between the survey periods, from 93.2% to 97.2% (p < 0.001) among 12- to 19-year-olds. For children, non-Hispanic black ethnicity and younger age were associated with lower seroprevalence in both survey periods. CONCLUSIONS: Varicella seroprevalence increased with age among children and was uniformly high in the U.S. adult population between 1999 and 2004. The original testing produced false-negative seroprevalence results among children's specimens collected between 1999 and 2004 from 6- to 19-year-olds.",nocancer
"Expression of cathepsin S and its inhibitor stefin A in sinonasal inverted papilloma. BACKGROUND: Dysregulation of cysteinyl cathepsins and their inhibitors, cystatins (stefins), were implied in progression of tumorgenesis; nevertheless, their role in sinonasal inverted papilloma (IP) is still unrecognized. METHODS: The differential expression of cathepsins and stefins in IP and normal tissues were revealed by data of human Affymetrix U133A gene chips, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Among the cathepsins and stefins family, expression of cathepsin S and stefin A were most differentially expressed (down- and up-regulated, respectively) in IP tissue as compared with normal tissues. Their expression levels were validated by real-time PCR, which showed the expression level of cathepsin S was significantly down-regulated, whereas the expression of stefin A was significantly up-regulated in IP tissue compared to normal sinus mucosa. Using immunohistochemistry, expression of cathepsin S was observed in stromal and epithelial area macrophages of normal sinus mucosa, but no obvious expression of cathepsin S was found in IP tissue. In contrast, over-expression of stefin A was present in nearly all layers of the proliferative squamous cells of IP, but expression of stefin A was only detected in a scattered area of normal sinus mucosa. CONCLUSION: Down-regulation of cathepsin S and up-regulation of its endogenous inhibitor, stefin A, were found in IP tissues as compared with their expression level in normal sinus mucosa tissues. The biological significance of inverse expression of both stefin A and cathepsin S in sinonasal IP need further investigation in the future.",cancer
"EBV-associated cutaneous NK/T-cell lymphoma: review of a series of 14 cases from peru in children and young adults. We have reviewed clinically, morphologically, and immunophenotypically a series of 14 Epstein-Bar virus (EBV)+ cutaneous natural killer cell (NK)/T-cell lymphoma from Peru. Most (11 out of 14) of these cases fit well into the category of Hydroa vacciniforme-like lymphoma (HVLL), but 3 have a different clinical presentation, without facial involvement. In all 14 cases, skin lesions present in both the sun-exposed and nonexposed areas exhibited a slowly progressive relapsing course, changing from edema, to blistering, ulceration, and final scarring. The immunophenotype had a cytotoxic T or NK-cell lineage. The mean time of disease before admission to hospital was 69 months (range, 6 mo to 31 y). Only 2 patients had fever, hepatosplenomegaly, systemic lymphadenopathy, and a high lactate dehydrodenage (LDH) level at the time of diagnosis, whereas 10 had facial swelling. After treatment, only 4 patients remain alive, although with persistent disease. Ten patients died after a mean follow-up of 11.6 months after the initial diagnosis (range, 1 to 32 mo), because of concurrent infections (4 cases), disease progression (4 patients) or both (2 patients). Endemic Epstein-Bar virus (EBV)-positive cutaneous NK/T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders in childhood and early adulthood are characterized by a protracted clinical course, eventually leading to an aggressive phase characterized by concurrent infections and disease progression.",cancer
"Use of pathway information in molecular epidemiology. Candidate gene studies are generally motivated by some form of pathway reasoning in the selection of genes to be studied, but seldom has the logic of the approach been carried through to the analysis. Marginal effects of polymorphisms in the selected genes, and occasionally pairwise gene-gene or gene-environment interactions,are often presented, but a unified approach to modelling the entire pathway has been lacking. In this review, a variety of approaches to this problem is considered, focusing on hypothesis-driven rather than purely exploratory methods. Empirical modelling strategies are based on hierarchical models that allow prior knowledge about the structure of the pathway and the various reactions to be included as 'prior covariates'. By contrast, mechanistic models aim to describe the reactions through a system of differential equations with rate parameters that can vary between individuals, based on their genotypes. Some ways of combining the two approaches are suggested and Bayesian model averaging methods for dealing with uncertainty about the true model form in either framework is discussed. Biomarker measurements can be incorporated into such analyses, and two-phase sampling designs stratified on some combination of disease, genes and exposures can be an efficient way of obtaining data that would be too expensive or difficult to obtain on a full candidate gene sample. The review concludes with some thoughts about potential uses of pathways in genome-wide association studies.",cancer
"Prereferral rectal artesunate for treatment of severe childhood malaria: a cost-effectiveness analysis. BACKGROUND: Severely ill patients with malaria with vomiting, prostration, and altered consciousness cannot be treated orally and need injections. In rural areas, access to health facilities that provide parenteral antimalarial treatment is poor. Safe and effective treatment of most severe malaria cases is delayed or not achieved. Rectal artesunate interrupts disease progression by rapidly reducing parasite density, but should be followed by further antimalarial treatment. We estimated the cost-effectiveness of community-based prereferral artesunate treatment of children suspected to have severe malaria in areas with poor access to formal health care. METHODS: We assessed the cost-effectiveness (in international dollars) of the intervention from the provider perspective. We studied a cohort of 1000 newborn babies until 5 years of age. The analysis assessed how the cost-effectiveness results changed with low (25%), moderate (50%), high (75%), and full (100%) referral compliance and intervention uptake. FINDINGS: At low intervention uptake and referral compliance (25%), the intervention was estimated to avert 19 disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs; 95% CI 16-21) and to cost I$1173 (95% CI 1050-1297) per DALY averted. Under the full uptake and compliance scenario (100%), the intervention could avert 967 DALYs (884-1050) at a cost of I$77 (73-81) per DALY averted. INTERPRETATION: Prereferral artesunate treatment is a cost-effective, life-saving intervention, which can substantially improve the management of severe childhood malaria in rural African settings in which programmes for community health workers are in place.

"The minimally invasive approach, laparoscopic and robotic, in rectal resection for cancer. A single center experience. BACKGROUND: Robotic approach for rectal cancer competes with laparoscopy in centers dedicated to minimally invasive surgery (MIS) due to the technologic advantage. This is a report of our experience with MIS for rectal cancer. METHODS: A series of 84 consecutive patients with laparoscopic resection (between 1995-2010) and 38 consecutive patients with robotic resection (between 2008-2010) for primary rectal cancer were analyzed. Hartmann's procedures were excluded. Clinical and pathologic outcomes were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: In the laparoscopic group (LG), 50 anterior rectal resections (ARR), 34 abdominal perineal resections (APR) were performed while in the robotic group(RG) there were 30 ARR and 8 APR. The median operative time was 182 min (140-220 min) in LG and 208 min (180-300 min) in RG (p = 0.0002). No statistically significant difference was noticed between the groups in terms of conversion, morbidity, anastomotic leak and postoperative stay rates. Margin clearance was obtained in all patients and the median number of removed lymph nodes was similar: 11.37 in RG vs. 11.07 in the LG (p = 0.65) with a higher rate of metastatic lymph node involvement in laparoscopy (p = 0.0l012). Blood loss was higher in LG (150 ml vs. 100 ml; p = 0.0001). There were 5 (5.9%) local recurrences in the LG at a median follow-up of 27.5 months and 2 (5.2%) in the RG at a median follow-up of 13 months (p = 0.43). CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive surgery for rectal cancer proved to be safe and efficient with similar results in the two groups. Technological advances of robotic approach compared to laparoscopy allowed better ergonomics, more refined dissection, easier preserving of hypogastric nerves and less blood loss. Long term outcomes are to be assessed in prospective randomized studies.",cancer
"Neck dissection after chemoradiotherapy: timing and complications. OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of postchemoradiotherapy (post-CRT) neck dissection (ND) complications; to ascertain whether timing (< 12 vs >/= 12 weeks) from CRT to ND or other factors are associated with increased complications; and to determine whether ND timing influences disease control or survival. DESIGN: Ten-year retrospective analysis. SETTING: Tertiary care center. PATIENTS: One hundred five patients with head and neck cancer undergoing ND after CRT. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Complications and survival variables compared between groups undergoing ND less than 12 weeks (less-than-12-weeks ND group) and 12 weeks or more (12-weeks-or-more ND group) after CRT. RESULTS: Sixty-seven NDs were performed less than 12 weeks and 38 were performed 12 weeks or more after CRT. Patient characteristics, treatment, and ND pathology results were comparable between the 2 ND groups. The incidence of complications between the less-than-12-weeks and the 12-weeks-or-more ND groups included major wound complications in 8 of 67 (11.9%) vs 1 of 38 (2.6%; P = .15), minor wound complications in 11 of 67 (16.4%) vs 4 of 38 (10.5%; P = .56), airway complications in 7 of 67 (10.4%) vs 2 of 38 (5.3%; P = .48), and systemic complications in 9 of 67 (13.4%) vs 2 of 38 (5.3%; P = .32). The number of patients with at least 1 complication was significantly smaller in the 12-weeks-or-more ND group (P = .04). Multivariate analysis showed that radical ND was significantly associated with an increased number of complications, and higher radiation doses approached significance (P = .05). Induction chemotherapy was associated with fewer wound complications (P = .01). There were no significant differences in overall survival (P = .82), progression-free survival (P = .77), or regional relapse (P = .54) between groups. Positive ND findings were associated with diminished progression-free and overall survival. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that ND can be safely performed 12 weeks or more after CRT without adversely affecting surgical complications or survival variables.",cancer

"Placental site trophoblastic tumor presenting as a friable cervical mass. PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATION: Placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT) is a rare variant of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) and primarily composed of intermediate trophoblasts. In contrast to other forms of GTN, PSTT presents with only mildly elevated levels of beta-hCG and immunohistochemical staining of tissue samples is a helpful tool for diagnosis. CASE AND RESULTS: A 38-year-old gravida 3, parity 3 female presented to the emergency department after three weeks of abnormal vaginal bleeding. The uterus was mildly enlarged, midline, and mobile with minimal discomfort. A necrotic, friable mass was protruding through the cervical os and biopsies were obtained. The serum beta-hCG was 13 mIU/ml. Computed tomography revealed a mass within the endometrial cavity and cervix but no significant lymphatic adenopathy or metastasis. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for cytokeratin AE1/AE3, E-cadherin, human placental lactogen (hPL), and alpha inhibin. Surgery was considered curative. CONCLUSION: PSTT presenting as a friable cervical mass is uncommon. Biopsies of this mass lead to the correct diagnosis. Several immunohistochemical stains are suggested in the literature to evaluate for PSTT. Clinically, it is prudent for physicians to differentiate PSTT from other forms of GTN because of the poor response of PSTT to chemotherapy.",cancer

"HPV/cervical cancer vaccination: parental preferences on age, place and information needs. INTRODUCTION: A vaccine against cervical cancer is available in New Zealand through school and primary care for girls aged 12-18 years. Factors that might increase or hinder widespread uptake by the target population need to be identified. AIM: To describe parents' preferences on where their daughter(s) receive the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, at what age, and their information needs. METHODS: 3123 questionnaires were distributed to parents recruited from 14 schools in 2008, prior to the start of the school-based vaccination programme. Outcome measures were: preferred age and place of vaccination, and information needs of parents and their daughters. Tests for significance were performed to determine whether parental preferences differed by ethnic group (Maori, Pacific, New Zealand European and 'Other'). RESULTS: A 25% response rate was achieved (769/3123). Receipt of the HPV vaccine in a clinic setting was preferred by 40% of parents; 25% preferred vaccination at school. Fifty percent preferred vaccination to occur at age 13 or older; 28% thought ages 10, 11 or 12 appropriate. One in three parents wanted more information and 65% said they would seek information from their family doctor before deciding on the vaccine for their daughter(s). DISCUSSION: We suggest that a programme delivered jointly in primary care and school settings, that is appropriately resourced for follow-up and information-sharing, would increase vaccine coverage. The rationale for vaccination at age 12 needs to be made clear to parents and evidence-based information needs to be delivered appropriately to parents and girls.",cancer

The tumor showed identical immunohistochemical profile to colonic villous adenoma. The patient has been well for more than a year after tumor removal.",cancer
"Effectiveness of voice rehabilitation on vocalisation in postlaryngectomy patients: a systematic review. BACKGROUND: Laryngeal cancer is one of the most common malignant neoplasia of the head and neck. Its incidence has been increasing steadily all over the world. Many patients will undergo total laryngectomy with or without radical neck dissection after being diagnosed. After this surgery, normal speech is lost, and a permanent stoma in the middle of the neck is left. Therefore, voice rehabilitation is one of the most difficult challenges that these patients must overcome. In order to support the patients, otolaryngologists, nursing specialists and speech pathologists have explored several different methods for voice rehabilitation. Variations exist on the approaches of rehabilitation and indicators selected to measure the effectiveness. There is a need to undertake a systematic review to provide a plan of care and ascertain the effectiveness regarding different voice rehabilitation programs for postlaryngectomy patients. REVIEW OBJECTIVE: To critically analyse the literature and present the best available evidence related to the effectiveness of voice rehabilitation program on postlaryngectomy patients. SEARCH STRATEGY: A three-step search strategy was utilised. An initial limited search of MEDLINE and CINAHL databases was undertaken followed by an analysis of the text words contained in the title and abstract to identify the optimal index terms. A second extensive search using all identified key words and index terms was then undertaken. Third, the reference list and bibliographies of all identified reports and articles were searched for additional studies. The measurement index included voice intelligibility, volume, clarity, quality of voice, patients' satisfaction, quality of life, etc. The search included reports in English and Chinese. SELECTION CRITERIA: The review considered any randomised controlled trials that addressed voice rehabilitation methods in postlaryngectomy patients. In the absence of randomised controlled trials, other quantitative research designs, such as non-randomised controlled trials, cohort studies and case-controlled studies, were considered for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Full copies of articles considered to meet the inclusion criteria were obtained for critical appraisal by two reviewers using the CASP (Critical Appraisal Skills Program) and McMaster scales. We utilised the 60% fulfilling of the evaluation scale items as the cut-off point and articles with a quality score less than 60% were excluded. Details of eligible trials were extracted and summarised by two reviewers independently using standardised data extraction tools developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute. RESULTS: Twenty-two articles were included in the review (Appendix I). Different voice rehabilitation methods for laryngectomees were investigated in the included studies including oesophageal voice, electrolarynx voice and surgical voice restoration. One cohort studies, five prospective studies, five retrospective studies and 11 descriptive studies were included. Because of the heterogeneity of included studies, meta-analysis was not possible. Therefore, the results were presented in narrative summary. The following main findings were identified: 1 At present, oesophageal speech, electrolarynx and tracheoesophageal were the commonly used voice rehabilitation methods with total laryngectomy patients. 2 Among these three methods, the success rate of electrolarynx and tracheoesophageal is much higher than oesophageal speech. 3 The intelligibility and speech quality of electrolarynx was lower than tracheoesophageal. 4 Patient satisfaction and self-assessed quality of life was better in tracheoesophageal group. 5 The objective index was similar between excellent tracheoesophageal and oesophageal speech patients. Conclusion 1 Electrolarynx is the easiest vocal rehabilitation method for total laryngectomy patients to use as it requires little training and does not limit the patients. But patients' satisfaction was lower because of the mechanical voice and noise. 2 Oesophageal speech is the hardest vocal rehabilitation method to learn. It needs a long period of time to practise and requires the patient to be in good physical condition and to be relatively young. The success rate was relatively lower; however, it is the most commonly used rehabilitation method in developing countries because of low cost. 3 Tracheoesophageal is the most commonly used voice rehabilitation method in developed countries. It is a surgical method that could be performed as either a primary procedure or secondary procedure. Reported patient quality of life and satisfaction following tracheoesophageal were the best; however, there are complications and the frequent replacement of the prostheses is an important problem yet to be solved. Implication for practice 1 Voice rehabilitation after total laryngectomy is an immediate and long-term problem that patients and health worker must face. 2 Healthcare workers should understand the advantages and disadvantages of each voice rehabilitation method in detail to assist people with total laryngectomy to make the most appropriate decision in regard to rehabilitation method taking into consideration their age, sex, physical condition, job, economic status and other context factors. Implication for research 1 Further high-quality studies comparing the effectiveness of oesophageal speech, electrolarynx and tracheoesophageal vocal rehabilitation methods are needed, especially with the subjective and objective outcome index concurrently. 2 Further investigation is required to identify strategies to decrease the complications of tracheoesophageal and reduce frequency of required tracheoesophageal replacement. 3 More research is needed in the context of developing countries where healthcare resources may be limited.",cancer

"Primary solitary fibrous tumor of the vulva: a case report. BACKGROUND: Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) of the female genital tract is an extremely rare neoplasm of mesenchymal origin. CASE: A case of primary SFT originated from the vulva of a 39-year-old woman. The tumor presented as a 10-cm, well-circumscribed lump and was composed of bland-looking cells admixed with thin and thick collagen fibers with the appearance of hemangiopericytoma. Immunohistochemically, the spindle cells were strongly positive for CD99 and vimentin, with focal positivity for CD34, and were negative for S100, SMA, desmin, ER, PR, etc. Microscopic evaluation and immunohistochemistry supported the diagnosis of a primary benign vulvar SFT. The patient remained well 10 months after excision. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this report is the first Chinese case of vulvar SFT in the English-language literature. SFT should be taken into consideration during the diagnostic process with spindle cell lesions of the vulva. The outcome of this tumor is based mostly on complete surgical resection.",cancer
"Autocrine TGF-beta and stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) signaling drives the evolution of tumor-promoting mammary stromal myofibroblasts. Much interest is currently focused on the emerging role of tumor-stroma interactions essential for supporting tumor progression. Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), frequently present in the stroma of human breast carcinomas, include a large number of myofibroblasts, a hallmark of activated fibroblasts. These fibroblasts have an ability to substantially promote tumorigenesis. However, the precise cellular origins of CAFs and the molecular mechanisms by which these cells evolve into tumor-promoting myofibroblasts remain unclear. Using a coimplantation breast tumor xenograft model, we show that resident human mammary fibroblasts progressively convert into CAF myofibroblasts during the course of tumor progression. These cells increasingly acquire two autocrine signaling loops, mediated by TGF-beta and SDF-1 cytokines, which both act in autostimulatory and cross-communicating fashions. These autocrine-signaling loops initiate and maintain the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts and the concurrent tumor-promoting phenotype. Collectively, these findings indicate that the establishment of the self-sustaining TGF-beta and SDF-1 autocrine signaling gives rise to tumor-promoting CAF myofibroblasts during tumor progression. This autocrine-signaling mechanism may prove to be an attractive therapeutic target to block the evolution of tumor-promoting CAFs.",cancer
"The joint effect of hOGG1 single nucleotide polymorphism and betel quid chewing on oral cancer in Taiwan. AIM: To evaluate the association and interaction among hOGG1 genotypic polymorphism, betel quid chewing status and oral cancer risk in Taiwan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The well-known polymorphic variants of hOGG1, codon 326, were analyzed in association with oral cancer susceptibility, and discussed regarding its joint effect with individual habits on oral cancer susceptibility. In total, 620 patients with oral cancer and 620 healthy controls recruited from the China Medical Hospital were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). RESULTS: The hOGG1 codon 326 genotypes were differently distributed between the oral cancer and control groups (p=0.0266) and the C allele of hOGG1 codon 326 was significantly (p=0.0046) more frequently found in cancer patients than in controls. We further analyzed the joint effects of gene variants and habits on oral cancer risk and found an interaction between hOGG1 codon 326 genotype and betel quid chewing status. The association of the C allele for hOGG1 codon 326 with oral cancer risk was found to be significant only in the betel quid chewer group (p=0.0149), not in the non-chewer group (p=0.8028). CONCLUSION: Our results provide evidence that the C allele of hOGG1 codon 326 may have a joint effect with betel quid chewing on the development of oral cancer.",cancer
"Pharmacokinetics and physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling of nanoparticles. The worldwide commerce involving nanoparticles will soon reach $1 trillion and already we have more than 600 commercial products containing nanoparticles. Because nanoparticles are invisible and little is known about their toxicities, there has been concern about health effects in humans. As toxicology is a continuum of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, this is a review of recent advances on pharmacokinetics and physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling involving nanoparticles. We provide a synopsis of the state-of-the-science on the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of nanoparticles in mammals, as well as some of the unique applications of pharmacokinetics to nanotechnology. Earlier, the main emphasis of pharmacokinetics of nanoparticles centered around the ""control release"" of drugs. Thus, drugs encapsulated by lipidic nanoparticles or bound to nano-particles form a controlled-release mechanism. The end results included, among others, enhancement of therapeutic duration and reversion of multidrug resistance. As the science advances in this area, the resulting achievements included: (1) utilizing nanoparticles as delivery vehicle for drugs, drug combinations, or genetic materials; (2) capitalizing on physico-chemical properties and tissue affinity of nanoparticles for medical imaging; (3) potentiating drug effects on immunotoxin and anticancer drugs; and (4) creating ""stealth"" capability from body's defense system. More recently, the application of biologically-based computer modeling to nanoparticles made it possible not only for inter-species, inter-routes, and inter-dose extrapolations but also for the integration of the modern tumor biology and computational technology for the possible improvement of cancer chemotherapy. Although pharmacokinetics and PBPK modeling of nanoparticles are still in their infancy, impressive innovations have already been demonstrated in their applications to medical sciences. Nanotoxicology is one of the most promising and fertile areas of science given the importance of nanoparticles to the economy of the 21st century, their possible environmental fates, as well as the potential health concerns of these particles.",nocancer

"Prevention of pneumococcal disease among infants and children - use of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine - recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). On February 24, 2010, a 13-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine (PCV13 [Prevnar 13, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc., marketed by Pfizer Inc.]) was licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) caused among infants and young children by the 13 pneumococcal serotypes covered by the vaccine and for prevention of otitis media caused by serotypes also covered by the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine formulation (PCV7 [Prevnar, Wyeth]). PCV13 contains the seven serotypes included in PCV7 (serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) and six additional serotypes (serotypes 1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, and 19A). PCV13 is approved for use among children aged 6 weeks-71 months and supersedes PCV7, which was licensed by FDA in 2000. This report summarizes recommendations approved by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) on February 24, 2010, for the use of PCV13 to prevent pneumococcal disease in infants and young children aged <6 years. Recommendations include 1) routine vaccination of all children aged 2-59 months, 2) vaccination of children aged 60-71 months with underlying medical conditions, and 3) vaccination of children who received >/=1 dose of PCV7 previously (CDC. Licensure of a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [PCV13] and recommendations for use among children-Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP], 2010. MMWR 2010;59:258-61). Recommendations also are provided for targeted use of the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23, formerly PPV23) in children aged 2-18 years with underlying medical conditions that increase their risk for contracting pneumococcal disease or experiencing complications of pneumococcal disease if infected. The ACIP recommendation for routine vaccination with PCV13 and the immunization schedules for children aged </=59 months who have not received any previous PCV7 or PCV13 doses are the same as those published previously for PCV7 (CDC. Preventing pneumococcal disease among infants and young children: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP]. MMWR 2000;49[No. RR-9]; CDC. Updated recommendation from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP] for use of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [PCV7] in children aged 24-59 months who are not completely vaccinated. MMWR 2008;57:343-4), with PCV13 replacing PCV7 for all doses. For routine immunization of infants, PCV13 is recommended as a 4-dose series at ages 2, 4, 6, and 12-15 months. Infants and children who have received >/=1 dose of PCV7 should complete the immunization series with PCV13. A single supplemental dose of PCV13 is recommended for all children aged 14-59 months who have received 4 doses of PCV7 or another age-appropriate, complete PCV7 schedule. For children who have underlying medical conditions, a supplemental PCV13 dose is recommended through age 71 months. Children aged 2-18 years with underlying medical conditions also should receive PPSV23 after completing all recommended doses of PCV13.",nocancer
"Racial/Ethnic disparities and geographic differences in lung cancer incidence --- 38 States and the District of Columbia, 1998-2006. Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in both males and females and the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Lung cancer affects some races more than others; blacks have higher incidence and mortality rates than do whites. This report presents the first analysis of lung cancer incidence among racial/ethnic groups by U.S. census region. CDC analyzed data collected by CDC's National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) and the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program for the period 1998-2006. These combined data reflect new lung cancer cases representing approximately 80% of the U.S. population. During this study period, annual incidence per 100,000 population was highest among blacks (76.1), followed by whites (69.7), American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) (48.4), and Asian/Pacific Islanders (A/PIs) (38.4). Hispanics had lower lung cancer incidence (37.3) than non-Hispanics (71.9). Incidence varied greatly with age, peaking among persons aged 70-79 years (426.7). The region with the highest incidence was the South (76.0); the lowest was the West (58.8). Among whites, the highest lung cancer incidence was in the South (76.3); the highest incidence among blacks (88.9), AI/ANs (64.2), and Hispanics (40.6) were in the Midwest, and the highest incidence among A/PIs was in the West (42.5). These findings identify the racial/ethnic populations and geographic regions that would most benefit from enhanced efforts in primary prevention, specifically by reducing tobacco use and exposure to environmental carcinogens.",cancer

"IgG4-related disease: a cross-sectional study of 114 cases. IgG4-related disease has been identified in various organs, but whether or not there are organ-specific characteristics related to the etiologic factors is still unknown. Here, we carried out a cross-sectional study of 114 patients with IgG4-related disease. On the basis of the location of the lesions, the patients were classified into 5 groups: head and neck (n=23), thoracic (n=16), hepatic and pancreatobiliary (n=27), retroperitoneal (n=13), and systemic (n=35). All groups had similar clinicopathologic features in various aspects. However, there were some organ-specific features: for example, the proportion of the female patients was significantly higher in the head and neck group, serum IgG4 concentrations were significantly higher in the head/neck and systemic groups, and all kidney lesions were associated with extrarenal disease. Unique pathologic features were dense fibrosis in dacryoadenitis, numerous lymph follicles in sialadenitis and dacryoadenitis, and obliterative arteritis in lung lesions. In addition, an epithelioid granuloma and rheumatoid nodule were noted within IgG4-related lesions in 2 patients, 1 each with a history of tuberculosis and rheumatoid arthritis, respectively. Malignant tumors (2 lung cancers and 1 malignant lymphoma) were identified after the diagnosis of IgG4-related disease in 3 patients, all in the systemic group. In conclusion, this study showed organ-specific features of IgG4-related disease. Further study is necessary to conclude whether these features reflect different manifestations of a single disease entity or suggest different underlying etiologic factors.",nocancer
"The Mediterranean and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diets and colorectal cancer. BACKGROUND: Although the Mediterranean diet has been studied for cancer mortality and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet shares similarities with the Mediterranean diet, few studies have specifically examined these 2 diets and incident colorectal cancer. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to prospectively assess the association between the Alternate Mediterranean Diet (aMed) and the DASH-style diet scores and risk of colorectal cancer in middle-aged men and women. DESIGN: A total of 87,256 women and 45,490 men (age 30-55 y for women and 40-75 y for men at baseline) without a history of cancer were followed for </= 26 y. The aMed and DASH scores were calculated for each participant by using dietary information that was assessed </= 7 times during follow-up. Relative risks (RRs) for colorectal cancer were computed with adjustment for potential confounders. RESULTS: We documented 1432 cases of incident colorectal cancer among women and 1032 cases in men. Comparing top with bottom quintiles of the DASH score, the pooled RR for total colorectal cancer was 0.80 (95% CI: 0.70, 0.91; P for trend = 0.0001). The corresponding RR for DASH score and colon cancer was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.69, 0.95; P for trend = 0.002). There was a suggestion of an inverse association with rectal cancer with a pooled RR of 0.73 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.98; P for trend = 0.31) when comparing top with bottom quintiles of DASH score. No association was observed with aMed score. CONCLUSION: Adherence to the DASH diet (which involves higher intakes of whole grains, fruit, and vegetables; moderate amounts of low-fat dairy; and lower amounts of red or processed meats, desserts, and sweetened beverages) was associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer.",cancer
"Long-term outcome after aortic arch replacement with a trifurcated graft. OBJECTIVE: We describe the long-term results of aortic arch replacement using a trifurcated graft, including an assessment of survival, neurologic complications, and graft patency.

Seventy-four patients (35.9%) had chronic dissection, 68 patients (33.0%) had atherosclerotic aneurysms, and 39 patients (18.9%) had degenerative disease. Ninety-one patients (44.2%) had undergone previous cardiac surgery. RESULTS: An elephant trunk was placed in 190 patients (92.2%) and completed in 101 patients (53.1%), with an interval of less than 365 days between stages in 94 of 101 patients. Hospital mortality was 6.8% (14/206). Adverse outcome (death/stroke within the first year postoperatively) occurred in 27.7% of patients (57/206; 50 deaths/7 strokes). Among 152 1-year survivors, the annual rates of transient ischemic attack and stroke were 0.85% and 1.1%, respectively. At 6 years, 75% of patients were still alive, compared with 92% in a matched New York State control population (P < .001). Follow-up computed tomography scans (189 studies in 176/206 patients [85.4%]) revealed 100% patency of the trifurcated graft limbs at a mean of 2.3 years. CONCLUSIONS: Aortic arch replacement using a trifurcated graft is highly durable, with excellent patency in the branch grafts, and is associated with a low incidence of cerebral embolization. However, the long-term outcome in these patients is compromised by extensive comorbidities.",nocancer
"Abortive HIV infection mediates CD4 T cell depletion and inflammation in human lymphoid tissue. The mechanism by which CD4 T cells are depleted in HIV-infected hosts remains poorly understood. In ex vivo cultures of human tonsil tissue, CD4 T cells undergo a pronounced cytopathic response following HIV infection. Strikingly, >95% of these dying cells are not productively infected but instead correspond to bystander cells. We now show that the death of these ""bystander"" cells involves abortive HIV infection. Inhibitors blocking HIV entry or early steps of reverse transcription prevent CD4 T cell death while inhibition of later events in the viral life cycle does not. We demonstrate that the nonpermissive state exhibited by the majority of resting CD4 tonsil T cells leads to accumulation of incomplete reverse transcripts. These cytoplasmic nucleic acids activate a host defense program that elicits a coordinated proapoptotic and proinflammatory response involving caspase-3 and caspase-1 activation. While this response likely evolved to protect the host, it centrally contributes to the immunopathogenic effects of HIV.",nocancer
"Correlation of biomarkers in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship of functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters, including choline/creatine ratio (Cho/Cr) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) with protein expression of 10 common tumor and prognostic markers in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: University hospital. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The Cho/Cr and ADC obtained from 74 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma were correlated with the expression level of the 10 protein markers as determined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Cho/Cr showed significant positive correlations with cyclooxygenase 2 in primary tumors (r = 0.714), and epidermal growth factor receptor in metastatic cervical lymph nodes (r = 0.522). ADC showed significant (r = -0.591) negative correlation with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 in metastatic cervical lymph nodes. CONCLUSION: There are relationships between protein and functional MRI markers. Future research in this direction may improve our understanding of the cancer micro-environment.",cancer
"Molecular virology in the clinical laboratory. As one can see by the tests listed at www.amp.org, molecular diagnostic techniques have enabled the laboratory professionals to play an integral role in the identification and quantitation of viral infectious agents. Viral loads can be determined for HIV, HBV, and HCV using a variety of molecular methods such as real-time PCR, TMA, NASBA, and bDNA. Determining the amount of viral particles in a sample can not only monitor the status and progression of the disease, but can also guide recommendations for antiviral therapy. Other assays listed include cytomegalovirus, enterovirus, and human metapneumovirus detection, HPV testing, influenza and respiratory virus panels, and West Nile virus detection in blood donations using a variety of molecular methodologies. The use of molecular methodologies in the detection of viral pathogens has grown at an astounding rate, especially in the past two decades. It is now widely accepted that PCR is the ""gold standard"" for nucleic acid detection in the clinical laboratory as well as in research facilities. This article only touched on some of the common, widely used assays and platforms used in the identification process. With more and more assays being developed, the cost behind molecular testing has decreased since there are more competitors on the market. At one point, laboratorians may have thought of routine molecular testing as the wave of the future. It is obvious the future is upon us. Molecular diagnostics has become part of the daily, routine workload in most clinical laboratories. The advent of fully automated systems with faster turn around times has given laboratory professionals the tools necessary to report out accurate and sensitive results to clinicians who can ultimately improve patient care and outcomes by rendering a correct and rapid diagnosis.",nocancer
"Interaction between preoperative CA-125 level and survival benefit of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in advanced epithelial ovarian cancer. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine whether neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has survival benefit in selected patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) who have high risk of suboptimal cytoreduction which is represented by high serum CA-125 level. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records of 314 patients with EOC including 94 patients who received NAC. After stratification by preoperative CA-125 levels, the progression-free survival (PFS) was compared between the NAC group and the primary debulking surgery (PDS) group. RESULTS: The NAC group had more FIGO stage IV disease (P<0.001) and higher CA-125 levels (P<0.001). Although suboptimal resection rate was higher in the PDS group (50% vs. 18%, P<0.001), however, NAC was not associated with increased PFS in multivariate Cox analysis (P=0.334). Nevertheless, after stratification according to CA-125 levels, NAC showed survival benefit in the subgroup with high CA-125 levels (>2000 U/ml; HR 0.62, P=0.037). CONCLUSION: Our preliminary data suggests the possible interaction between CA-125 levels and survival benefit of NAC. The randomized trial data about NAC should be stratified by the reproducible and relevant criteria such as preoperative serum CA-125 level to elucidate true survival benefit of NAC in ovarian cancer.",cancer
"Nanoscale architecture of integrin-based cell adhesions. Cell adhesions to the extracellular matrix (ECM) are necessary for morphogenesis, immunity and wound healing. Focal adhesions are multifunctional organelles that mediate cell-ECM adhesion, force transmission, cytoskeletal regulation and signalling. Focal adhesions consist of a complex network of trans-plasma-membrane integrins and cytoplasmic proteins that form a <200-nm plaque linking the ECM to the actin cytoskeleton. The complexity of focal adhesion composition and dynamics implicate an intricate molecular machine. However, focal adhesion molecular architecture remains unknown. Here we used three-dimensional super-resolution fluorescence microscopy (interferometric photoactivated localization microscopy) to map nanoscale protein organization in focal adhesions. Our results reveal that integrins and actin are vertically separated by a approximately 40-nm focal adhesion core region consisting of multiple protein-specific strata: a membrane-apposed integrin signalling layer containing integrin cytoplasmic tails, focal adhesion kinase and paxillin; an intermediate force-transduction layer containing talin and vinculin; and an uppermost actin-regulatory layer containing zyxin, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein and alpha-actinin. By localizing amino- and carboxy-terminally tagged talins, we reveal talin's polarized orientation, indicative of a role in organizing the focal adhesion strata. The composite multilaminar protein architecture provides a molecular blueprint for understanding focal adhesion functions.",nocancer
"Intravitreal bevacizumab for myopic choroidal neovascularization: 1-year and 2-year results. METHODS: A retrospective interventional case series of 29 patients with mCNV was conducted. Charts were reviewed of all patients who received IVB for active mCNV and who had a follow-up of at least 12 months after the first injection. Patients were divided into three groups based on length of followup: patients in Group 1 had a follow-up of > or =12 months, in Group 2 of > or =18 months and in Group 3 of > or =24 months. Changes in visual acuity (VA) and CMT were analyzed, as were safety considerations such as intraocular inflammation and endophthalmitis. RESULTS: Twenty women and nine men with a mean age of 62.2 years (range 31-85) were included. No peri- or post-injection ocular or systemic side effects were noted in either group. Mean logMAR best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at baseline for all patients (n=29) was 0.71. Mean visual acuity for all 29 patients had improved significantly at 3 months (p = 0.0035) and one year (p = 0.0042) after baseline. Although visual acuity gains were maintained at 18 and 24 months, these were not statistically significant (p = 0.11 and p = 0.19, respectively). The mean CMT decreased significantly at one year after baseline. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that administration of intravitreal bevacizumab is a safe and effective treatment modality for mCNV. Statistically significant visual improvement can be obtained.",nocancer
"The biology of myeloid-derived suppressor cells: the blessing and the curse of morphological and functional heterogeneity. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) play an important role in the cellular network regulating immune responses in cancer, chronic infectious diseases, autoimmunity, and in other pathological conditions. Morphological, phenotypic and functional heterogeneity is a hallmark of MDSC. This heterogeneity demonstrates the plasticity of this immune suppressive myeloid compartment, and shows how various tumors and infectious agents can have similar biological effects on myeloid cells despite the differences in the factors that they produce to influence the immune system; however, such a heterogeneity creates ambiguity in the definition of MDSC as well as confusion regarding the origin and fate of these cells. In this review, we will discuss recent findings that help to better clarify these issues and to determine the place of MDSC within the myeloid cell lineage.",cancer
"Monitoring of human papillomavirus vaccination. Persistent infection with oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) is a necessary causal factor in the development of cervical cancer. Moreover, HPV, predominately type 16 and to a lesser degree type 18, is linked causally to varying proportions of other anogenital cancers (vulva, vagina, penis, anus) as well as cancers elsewhere in the body (oropharynx, larynx, conjunctiva). HPV types 6 and 11 cause most of genital warts and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Effective prophylactic vaccines have been developed. In this review, we address briefly the immunological aspects of HPV infection and the results of HPV vaccination trials. Internationally standardized monitoring and evaluation of prophylactic HPV vaccination programmes will be essential for arriving at the most cost-effective strategies for cancer control.",cancer
"Diagnosis of hidradenoma papilliferum of the vulva on cytologic smears: a case report. BACKGROUND: Hidradenoma papilliferum is a rare benign tumor of the vulva that occurs mainly in women in the skin of the anogenital region. Clinically it may mimic a carcinoma, so the correct cytologic interpretation of the tumor cells with subsequent careful histologic confirmation is essential for good management. CASE: A 44-year-old woman who had a history of hysterectomy 14 years earlier presented with a small, exophytic growth on the labia majora. Fine needle aspiration cytology and vulvar scraping of the lesion were reported as a malignant tumor, and the case was referred to our center for further management. Repeat vulvar smears showed mainly groups and clusters of benign-looking glandular cells and were interpreted as a benign tumor. Subsequent histology confirmed the diagnosis of hidradenoma papilliferum. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the cytologic features of hidradenoma papilliferum on cytologic smears. The clinical presentation should not mislead the cytologic interpretation of the tumor cells.",cancer
"Late toxicities in concurrent chemoradiotherapy using high-dose-rate intracavitary brachytherapy plus weekly cisplatin for locally advanced cervical cancer: a historical cohort comparison against two previous different treatment schemes. PURPOSE: To determine the long-term toxicity of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT), using high-dose rate intracavitary brachytherapy (HDRICB) compared to radiation (RT) alone in patients with advanced cervical cancer using a control-cohort study. METHODS: A total of 332 cases of Stage IIB-III disease were included in this comparative study. Seventy-three patients were treated with a 3-insertion schedule and labeled group A, whereas the other 146 patients with a 4-insertion schedule became group B. One hundred and thirteen patients treated by a 4-insertion protocol with concurrent weekly cisplatin were labeled group C. RESULTS: The cumulative rate of grade 2 or above rectal complication was 13.7% for group A, 9.6% for the group B and 15.9% for group C (p = 0.76), whereas the grade 3 to 4 non-rectal radiation-induced intestinal injury was 6.8% for group A, 6.2% for group B and 9.7% for group C (p = 0.20). Grade 2 to 4 late bladder toxicity was higher in group C, with the cumulative rate being 5.5% for group A, 4.8% for group B and 15.0% for group C (p = 0.004). The independent factor for a rectal complication was the occurrence of a bladder complication (p = 0.01, hazard ratio 3.06). The independent factors for bladder complications were the use of CCRT (p = 0.01, hazard ratio 2.08), and the occurrence of rectal complications (p = 0.02, hazard ratio 2.77). CONCLUSIONS: When treating advanced cervical cancer, HDRICB consisting of four 6 Gy insertions and weekly cisplatin shows a trend of increasing late bladder complications. The interval between drug administration and HDRICB should be kept long enough to avoid any synergistic effect of both regimens.",cancer
"Evidence for folate in combination with antidepressants at initiation of therapy. Although the goal of treatment for major depressive disorder is full remission, for most patients, remission is the exception rather than the rule. Carefully choosing medications with synergistic mechanisms of action at treatment initiation may increase rates of response and remission and decrease the risk for relapse. An agent such as folate, which is a naturally occurring B vitamin and is necessary for the synthesis of the trimonoamine neurotransmitters implicated in depression, may enhance the effects of a traditional antidepressant.",nocancer

"Thoracic endovascular aortic repair for acute complicated type B aortic dissection: superiority relative to conventional open surgical and medical therapy. OBJECTIVE: This study compared outcomes between thoracic endovascular aortic repair and conventional open surgical and medical therapies for acute complicated type B aortic dissection. METHODS: From 2002 to 2010, a total of 170 patients with type B aortic dissections were retrospectively identified from the University of Pennsylvania aortic database. Of these 170 patients, 147 had acute type B aortic dissections (uncomplicated 70, complicated 77). For patients with acute complicated type B aortic dissections, management included thoracic endovascular aortic repair (group A) or conventional open surgical and medical therapies (group B). RESULTS: In the 77 patients with acute complicated type B aortic dissections, thoracic endovascular aortic repair (group A) was performed in 45 patients (59%). In group B, 20 patients (26%) underwent open surgical repair and 12 (15%) had their conditions managed with medical therapy. Thoracic endovascular aortic repair was associated with lower in-hospital or 30-day mortality (n = 2, 4%) than conventional therapy (open surgical repair n = 8, 40%, medical therapy, n = 4, 33%, P = .006). Patients in group A (thoracic endovascular aortic repair) continued to show significantly improved survival at 1, 3, and 5 years (group A: 82%, 79%, and 79% vs group B: 58%, 52%, and 44%, P = .008). CONCLUSIONS: Thoracic endovascular aortic repair for acute complicated type B dissection is associated with superior early outcome and improved midterm survival relative to conventional therapy.

In this report, we describe a case of Mullerian papilloma of the vagina in a 9-year-old girl. We believe in the importance of a correct clinical setting and histological definition to avoid wrong diagnosis and consequent inadequate treatments. Mullerian papilloma, a benign tumor, can in fact be treated only with local excision.",cancer
"Ionizing radiation exposure to patients admitted with acute myocardial infarction in the United States. BACKGROUND: Invasive and noninvasive cardiovascular imaging is beneficial in the care of patients admitted with acute myocardial infarction. Little is known about patients' cumulative radiation exposure. METHODS AND RESULTS: All patients admitted with an acute myocardial infarction to any of 49 University HealthSystem Consortium member hospitals from 2006 to 2009 were reviewed for inpatient procedures involving ionizing radiation that included chest radiograph, computed tomogram scans, radionuclide imaging, diagnostic cardiac catheterization, and percutaneous coronary intervention. The average cumulative effective radiation dose per patient was estimated on the basis of published typical effective radiation doses for imaging procedures. Patients (n=64 071) admitted for acute myocardial infarction had a median age of 64.9 years. A total of 276 651 procedures involving ionizing radiation were performed during the study period, a median of 4.3 procedures per patient per admission. The majority of patients had invasive catheterization (77%), followed by computed tomogram scans (52%), mostly body examinations. The median cumulative effective radiation dose delivered was 15.02 mSv per patient per acute myocardial infarction admission. Postprocedural bleeding was a significant predictor of radiation exposure (odds ratio, 2.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.85 to 2.18), together with postprocedural mechanical complications resulting from device implantation (odds ratio, 2.86; 95% confidence interval, 2.61 to 3.13). Patients with higher underlying clinical complexity (defined by severity of illness scores) had higher radiation exposure and higher mortality (P<0.0001). There was also significant geographic variation in radiation exposure; patients in New England received the lowest cumulative exposure (odds ratio, 0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.74 to 0.81). CONCLUSIONS: Acute myocardial infarction inpatients are exposed to an approximate median radiation dose of 15 mSv. This exposure is a result of multiple cardiovascular and noncardiovascular procedures. Efforts should be made to understand the risks and benefits of radiation exposure per episode of care for acute myocardial infarction.",cancer
"Carbonic anhydrase IX expression in renal neoplasms: correlation with tumor type and grade. Carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), a hypoxia-induced protein, is expressed in some renal tumors. We evaluated its immunohistochemical expression in 317 primary and 42 metastatic renal neoplasms (186 clear cell, 52 papillary, 35 chromophobe, 47 unclassified, and 15 Xp11.2 translocation renal cell carcinomas [RCCs]; 26 oncocytomas; 2 metanephric adenomas; 1 urothelial carcinoma; 1 mixed epithelial and stromal tumor; and 1 angiomyolipoma); 7 neoplasms were unknown as to whether they were primary or metastatic. We also correlated expression with tumor type and grade. Variable staining was seen in clear cell, papillary, unclassified, and Xp11.2 translocation carcinomas. One chromophobe carcinoma had focal expression. No staining was seen with other tumors. An association was found between high expression and clear cell vs non-clear cell carcinomas with all cases (P < .01) and primary (P < .01) cases. An association between CAIX expression and grade (P < .01) in primary clear cell carcinomas was found. CAIX expression is more common in clear cell RCC than other renal tumor types and is associated with grade.",cancer
"Reflective blogs in clinical education to promote critical thinking in dental hygiene students. One challenge facing dental hygiene, as well as dental, education is to identify clinical teaching strategies promoting critical thinking and clinical reasoning. These skills are crucial elements in the practice of dental hygiene. A two-group design (intervention, n=28, and control, n=30) assessed first-year dental hygiene students using pre-and post-Health Science Reasoning Test (HSRT) scores to evaluate the effect of reflective blogging on critical thinking skills. A reflective blog rubric, based on Mezirow's levels of reflection, determined if reflective blogging increased the level of reflection for dental hygiene students. The results suggest within this nonprobability sample that reflective blogging did not produce a significant change in students' HSRT scores (p>0.05). However, analyses of reflective blog rubric scores demonstrated statistically significant improvements (p<0.05) in students' levels of reflection. Furthermore, data analysis revealed a correlation (p<0.05) between HSRT subscale scores and the element of reflection scores for the intervention group. This study addressed needs of the dental and dental hygiene education community by examining the use of blogs, an emerging technology, as a tool for reflecting on clinical experiences and, in turn, for promoting critical thinking.",nocancer
"Examining the metastatic niche: targeting the microenvironment. Some of the most common cancer types, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, and lung cancer, show a predilection to metastasize to bone. The molecular basis of this preferential growth of cancer cells in the bone microenvironment has been an area of active investigation. Although the precise molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain to be elucidated, it is now increasingly being recognized that the unique characteristics of the bone niche provide homing signals to cancer cells, and create a microenvironment conducive for the cancer cells to colonize. Concomitantly, cancer cells release several regulatory factors that result in abnormal bone destruction and/or formation. This complex bidirectional interplay between tumor cells and bone microenvironment establishes a ""vicious cycle"" that leads to a selective growth advantage for the cancer cells. The molecular insights gained on the underpinnings of bone metastasis in recent years have also provided us with avenues to devise innovative approaches for therapeutic intervention. The goal of this review is to describe our current understanding of molecular pathophysiology of cancer metastases to bone, as well as its therapeutic implications.",cancer
"The epidermal growth factor receptor pathway in relation to pelvic lymph node metastasis and survival in early-stage cervical cancer. The objective of this study is to correlate the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) components with clinical behavior of early-stage cervical cancer. Tissue samples of 336 consecutive Federation of International Gynecologists and Obstetricians stage IB-IIA cervical cancer patients all treated primarily by radical surgery were collected. Clinicopathologic and follow-up data were prospectively obtained during standard treatment and follow-up. As representatives for the EGFR pathway, expression of EGFR, pEGFR, PTEN, pAKT, and pERK was assessed by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays. Positive immunostaining was observed for EGFR in 32.1%, for pEGFR in 21.0%, for PTEN in 38.3%, for pAKT in 5.3%, and for pERK in 4.3% of tumor samples. Positive EGFR immunostaining was associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix (odds ratio [OR], 7.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.38-16.23, P < .001), negative pEGFR immunostaining with poor differentiation (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.20-0.73, P = .004), and negative PTEN immunostaining with metastatic pelvic lymph nodes (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.30-0.90, P = .019). In multivariate analysis, only pelvic lymph node metastasis (hazard ratio, 6.11; 95% CI, 3.46-10.77, P < .001) and poor differentiation (hazard ratio, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.12-3.26, P = .018) were related to disease-specific survival. In early-stage cervical cancer, loss of PTEN expression is associated with pelvic lymph node metastasis, suggesting PTEN to be one of the tumor suppressor genes affecting pelvic lymph node metastasis. However, expression of EGFR pathway components does not appear to have prognostic impact in surgically treated early-stage cervical cancer.",cancer
"Fine needle aspiration cytology in primary breast angiosarcoma: a case report. BACKGROUND: Angiosarcoma of the breast is an uncommon, aggressive, vascular tumor. The cytomorphologic features of angiosarcomas have rarely been reported. CASE: The present study describes a case of breast angiosarcoma initially diagnosed by fine needle aspiration cytology. Angiosarcoma appeared in the left breast of a 58-year-old woman after 12 years of a mastectomy (without radiotherapy) of the contralateral breast for invasive ductal carcinoma. Fine needle aspiration cytology yielded very bloody material with moderate cellularity. Microscopically, two types of cells were observed: spindle cells and epithelial-like cells with nuclear atypia. The latter were arranged in tight clusters with papillary configuration. Both cell types exhibited immunoreactivity for endothelial markers. The diagnosis of angiosarcoma was confirmed by histopathology of the surgically excised tumor. CONCLUSION: Angiosarcoma rarely occurs in the breast, and a definitive diagnosis is extremely difficult relying exclusively on cytologic features. Predominance of epithelioid cells may suggest an epithelial tumor, especially in patients with a history of breast carcinoma, whereas predominance of spindle cells can be misinterpreted as phyllodes tumor or another type of sarcoma. Cell block immunocytochemistry and tumor cell labeling with endothelial markers are necessary for accurate diagnosis.",cancer
"Neonatal abstinence syndrome after methadone or buprenorphine exposure. BACKGROUND: Methadone, a full mu-opioid agonist, is the recommended treatment for opioid dependence during pregnancy. However, prenatal exposure to methadone is associated with a neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) characterized by central nervous system hyperirritability and autonomic nervous system dysfunction, which often requires medication and extended hospitalization. Buprenorphine, a partial mu-opioid agonist, is an alternative treatment for opioid dependence but has not been extensively studied in pregnancy. METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, double-dummy, flexible-dosing, randomized, controlled study in which buprenorphine and methadone were compared for use in the comprehensive care of 175 pregnant women with opioid dependency at eight international sites. Primary outcomes were the number of neonates requiring treatment for NAS, the peak NAS score, the total amount of morphine needed to treat NAS, the length of the hospital stay for neonates, and neonatal head circumference. RESULTS: Treatment was discontinued by 16 of the 89 women in the methadone group (18%) and 28 of the 86 women in the buprenorphine group (33%). A comparison of the 131 neonates whose mothers were followed to the end of pregnancy according to treatment group (with 58 exposed to buprenorphine and 73 exposed to methadone) showed that the former group required significantly less morphine (mean dose, 1.1 mg vs. 10.4 mg; P<0.0091), had a significantly shorter hospital stay (10.0 days vs. 17.5 days, P<0.0091), and had a significantly shorter duration of treatment for the neonatal abstinence syndrome (4.1 days vs. 9.9 days, P<0.003125) (P values calculated in accordance with prespecified thresholds for significance). There were no significant differences between groups in other primary or secondary outcomes or in the rates of maternal or neonatal adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with the use of buprenorphine as an acceptable treatment for opioid dependence in pregnant women.

"Kidney biopsy in the elderly. Renal biopsy continues to play an essential role in the clinical assessment of hematuria, proteinuria and kidney failure. Nonetheless, the indications for renal biopsy are still controversial. The best determination of the potential benefit of an invasive diagnostic procedure comes from the demonstration that knowledge of a specific diagnosis guides the selection of treatments that produce improved outcomes. The size of the aging population is growing. In the years between 1980 and 1997, an 18% increase occurred in the number of individuals more than 65 years of age in the USA, and a 73% increase of those more than 85 years of age. Elderly patients are surviving longer with both acute and chronic disease, they are adapting to functional limitations in positive ways and they are choosing life-prolonging treatments that were not available to this population in the past. Despite these changes, several authors discuss physician biases that influence care of the elderly, and they argue that criteria for diagnosis and treatment should be the same as in younger patients. Many of the diagnoses made are treatable, and when treated, the outcome improves. Although comparison of survival data for patients with the general population would have been informative, data showing that loss of renal function correlates with shortened survival imply that interventions that delay progression to end-stage renal disease should significantly impact mortality. Thus, a bias toward limited diagnosis based on age alone is not justified. Histology is essential to precisely characterize the glomerular diseases underlying nonspecific clinical pictures and to direct the best therapeutic strategies. Our experience supported by larger studies from the United States showed that native kidney biopsy is safe and essential for diagnosis of renal disease and to direct the best therapeutic strategies in elderly patients.",nocancer

Analyses in university students (N=168) indicated that Self-leadership and its facets were more strongly related to Beta (Agency) than Alpha (Communion), and, although there were mostly positive correlations, Self-leadership should be distinguished from the Big Five traits. Findings are discussed regarding Self-leadership's associations with the Big Five traits and higher-order factors.",nocancer

"Real-time PCR: detection of oestrogen receptor-alpha and -beta isoforms and variants in breast cancer. BACKGROUND: Splice variants exist for both alpha and beta oestrogen receptors (ERs). Oestrogen function results from a balance between the wild-type ERs (wt) and their variants. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded breast cancer samples were analysed by real-time PCR using ERalpha primer sets detecting wt and exon-deleted 3, 5, 6 and 7 variants. The ERbeta primer sets detected wt ERbeta1 and ERbeta2 and ERbeta5 variants. At the end of the PCR cycles, a dissociation curve was generated showing the peaks for each sample at specific melting temperatures (Tm); finding more than one peak indicated the presence of variants. RESULTS: Many samples expressed both wt ER isoforms and their variants. The Tm value served as a cut-off point for determination of wt versus variant ER expression. CONCLUSION: This method of detection of wt and variant ER could help in patient selection for anti-oestrogen therapy and in monitoring response to therapy.",cancer
"Metastatic tumors in the pancreas in the modern era. BACKGROUND: Tumors metastasizing to the pancreas are rare, and published series are limited by few patients treated for extended periods of time. Renal cell cancer (RCC) is the most common primary tumor metastasizing to the pancreas. Our aim was to describe the clinicopathologic characteristics and patient outcomes in a modern series of patients who underwent metastasectomy, with an emphasis on RCC. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of all pancreatic resections between January 1993 and October 2009. RESULTS: We identified 40 patients with a median age of 62 years; 55% were female. Patients most commonly presented with abdominal pain (47.5%). Operations performed included 10 pancreaticoduodenectomies, 1 middle, 23 distal, 3 total pancreatectomies, and 3 enucleations. Primary cancers were RCC (n = 20), ovarian (n = 6), sarcoma (n = 3), colon (n = 3), melanoma (n = 2), and others (n = 6). Median survival for all patients after metastasectomy was 4.4 years. Median survival after metastasectomy for RCC was 8.7 years, and the 5-year actuarial survival was 61%. For RCCs, pancreas was the first site of an extrarenal recurrence in 85% and was synchronous with the primary in 5% of patients. There was no survival difference if the time interval to metastasis was shorter than the median (8.7 years), if tumor nodules were multiple or bigger than the median (3 cm), or if the pancreas was not the first site of metastases. CONCLUSIONS: An aggressive approach to lesions metastatic to the pancreas is often warranted if the patient can be rendered free of disease. Although patients with RCC can experience long-term survival after metastasectomy, survival is less favorable for other primary tumors.",cancer
"Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) and apoA-I mimetic peptides inhibit tumor development in a mouse model of ovarian cancer. We examined whether reduced levels of Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) in ovarian cancer patients are causal in ovarian cancer in a mouse model. Mice expressing a human apoA-I transgene had (i) increased survival (P < 0.0001) and (ii) decreased tumor development (P < 0.01), when compared with littermates, following injection of mouse ovarian epithelial papillary serous adenocarcinoma cells (ID-8 cells). ApoA-I mimetic peptides reduced viability and proliferation of ID8 cells and cis-platinum-resistant human ovarian cancer cells, and decreased ID-8 cell-mediated tumor burden in C57BL/6J mice when administered subcutaneously or orally. Serum levels of lysophosphatidic acid, a well-characterized modulator of tumor cell proliferation, were significantly reduced (>50% compared with control mice, P < 0.05) in mice that received apoA-I mimetic peptides (administered either subcutaneously or orally), suggesting that binding and removal of lysophosphatidic acid is a potential mechanism for the inhibition of tumor development by apoA-I mimetic peptides, which may serve as a previously unexplored class of anticancer agents.",cancer

"Quality assurance through outcome registration in colorectal cancer: an ECCO initiative for Europe. In recent years there have been significant improvements in outcome of rectal cancer treatment. Both new surgical techniques as well as effective neoadjuvant treatment regimens have contributed to these improvements. It is key to spread these advances towards every rectal cancer patient and to make sure that not only patients who are treated within the framework of clinical trials may benefit from these advancements. Throughout Europe there have been interesting quality programs that have proved to facilitate the spread of up to date knowledge and skills among medical professionals resulting in improved treatment outcome. Nevertheless, between European countries remain differences in outcome and treatment schedules that cannot be easily explained. The European CanCer Organisation (ECCO) has recognised these importances's and created the 'European Registration of Cancer Care' (EURECCA) framework to develop a European colorectal audit structure. EURECCA will advance future treatment improvements and spread these to all European cancer patients. It provides opportunities to treat elderly and comorbid patients evidence based while it offers an unique insight in social-economical healthcare matters. As such, ECCO has established the basis for a strong, multidisciplinary audit structure with the commitment to improve cancer care for every European cancer patient.",cancer
"Baseline characteristics of participants in the randomized national lung screening trial. BACKGROUND: The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), a randomized study conducted at 33 US sites, is comparing lung cancer mortality among persons screened with reduced dose helical computerized tomography and among persons screened with chest radiograph. In this article, we present characteristics of the study population. METHODS: Eligible participants were aged 55-74 years and were current or former smokers with a cigarette smoking history of at least 30 pack-years. Randomization was stratified by site, sex, and age. To assess representativeness of the study population, demographic characteristics of individuals from the general population who met NLST age and smoking history inclusion criteria were obtained from the Tobacco Use Supplement of the US Census Bureau Current Population Surveys. RESULTS: The NLST enrolled 53 456 persons, with 26 733 randomly assigned to chest radiograph screening and 26 723 to computerized tomography screening. Characteristics of the participants were as follows: 31 533 (59%) were men, 39 234 (73%) were younger than 65 years, 25 779 (48%) were current smokers, and 16 839 (32%) had a college or higher degree. Median cigarette exposure was 48 pack-years. Among Tobacco Use Supplement respondents who met NLST age and smoking history criteria, 59% were men, 65% were younger than 65 years, and 57% were current smokers. Median cigarette exposure among this group was 47 pack-years, and 14% had a college degree or higher. CONCLUSION: The NLST cohort has a distribution of sex and pack-year history that is similar to the component of the general US population that meets the major NLST eligibility criteria; however, NLST participants are younger, better educated, and less likely to be current smokers.",cancer

"Prevalence of neck and back pain among dentists and dental auxiliaries in South-western Nigeria. Dental health workers like other workers have occupation related health problems and hazards which include neck and low back pain. Previous studies have shown that the prevalence and location of pain may be influenced by posture and work habits and as well as demographic factors. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of neck and back problems among dentists and dental auxiliaries in private and government dental hospitals in south western Nigeria. Structured self administered questionnaire was sent to dentist and dental auxiliaries by randomly selecting 3 out of the 6 state capital from the southwestern Nigeria. Participants included those in private clinics, teaching hospitals and general hospitals. The questionnaire was composed of respondents biodata, questions about specific information on neck and back pain and routine practice posture while working at chairside. The total number of properly filled questionnaire was 210 with a male to female ratio of 1.04:1. Respondents included 147 dentists, 37 dental surgeon assistants (DSA), 14 dental therapists and 12 dental technologists. Prevalence of back and neck pain among the respondents was 88.1% and 81.9% respectively. Among the male respondents, the prevalence of back pain was 86.9% and 89.3% in female while for neck pain, the prevalence was 83.2% in male and 80.6% in female. Within the different professional groups, the prevalence of back pain was highest among the DSA (89.2%), closely followed by the dentists (88.4%), then therapists (85.7%) and least among the technologists (83.3%). For neck pain, the prevalence was highest among therapists followed by technologists, dentists and least among the DSA. More females missed work due to back and neck pain than males. There is therefore the need to address ergonomic issues and change the way dentistry is practiced.",nocancer
"CTLA4-induced splenomegaly and a review of the literature pertaining to autoimmune complications of therapy. CTLA4-blocking antibodies induce tumor regression in a subset of patients with metastatic melanoma by optimizing T-cell activity to fight the malignant cells. In addition to therapeutic benefits, CTLA4 therapy may induce immune-related adverse events (irAE). Studies on CTLA4 knockout and other CTLA4 deficient mice have resulted in splenomegaly, lymphoproliferation and fatal multi-organ destruction. The authors present a case of a 68-year-old patient who has developed splenomegaly following CTLA4 therapy. CTLA4 therapy's risks and benefits should be weighed carefully in the treatment of malignant melanoma. Larger prospective multi-center trials are needed to gauge the efficacy and complication rate of CTLA4 therapy. The authors propose that patients should get short-term surveillance imaging (CT or PET/CT) to exclude the multiple abdominopelvic complications and quickly terminate therapy if clinically warranted. It is also necessary for clinicians to carefully monitor for the number of possible complications associated with this immunotherapy.",cancer
"Intraoperative bacterial translocation detected by bacterium-specific ribosomal rna-targeted reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for the mesenteric lymph node strongly predicts postoperative infectious complications after major hepatectomy for biliary malignancies. BACKGROUND: There is little evidence indicating a causal linkage between bacterial translocation and postoperative infectious complication (POIC) in human studies. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation between the occurrence of bacterial translocation in the mesenteric lymph node (MLN) and POIC with a sensitive quantitative method using bacterium-specific ribosomal RNA (rRNA)-targeted reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). METHODS: Patients who underwent major hepatectomy for biliary malignancies involving hepatic hilus were included in this study (n = 65). Mesenteric lymph nodes were harvested from the jejunal mesentery 2 times during the operation (MLN-1 harvested at laparotomy and MLN-2 harvested after tumor resection). Microorganisms were detected by a bacterium-specific rRNA-targeted RT-qPCR method. Perioperative factors and POIC were recorded prospectively. RESULTS: Of 65 patients, 51 completed the study. Microorganisms were detected in MLN-1 and MLN-2 in 15 (29.4%) and 19 (37.3%) patients, respectively. The detection of microorganisms in MLN-1 was significantly correlated with the incidence of preoperative cholangitis (P = 0.04), whereas the detection of microorganisms in MLN-2 was significantly correlated with the incidence of POIC (P = 0.002). In multivariate analysis, a positive result for detection of microorganisms in MLN-2 was one of the independent predictive factors of POIC (odds ratio = 26.1). CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative analysis of MLNs (especially MLN-2) by rRNA-targeted RT-qPCR can strongly predict the occurrence of POIC after hepatectomy for biliary malignancy. This method is more sensitive and faster at detection of microorganisms than the conventional culture method. Therefore, we can obtain the information of bacterial translocation immediately after the surgery and can select the group of patients with high risk for POIC.",cancer

"New drugs for aggressive B-cell and T-cell lymphomas. Over the past decade an unprecedented number of new drugs for lymphomas have been developed. Most of these new drugs target molecules or pathways that are important for the growth and proliferation of lymphomas. The introduction of the B-lymphoma specific monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody, rituximab, has improved the prognosis of patients with B-cell lymphomas more than any other drug in the past 50 years; today less than half of the patients with aggressive B-cell lymphomas die of their disease than in the pre-rituximab era. Many new drugs are now available for clinical testing in addition to new CD20 antibodies and antibodies directed against other surface molecules specifically or preferentially expressed on the lymphoma-cell surface. A prerequisite for the development of these drugs was the recognition of aberrant cell-signal transduction involved in lymphoma pathogenesis and progression. New therapeutic targets include receptor tyrosine and cyclin-dependent kinases, histone deacetylases, and molecules involved in the regulation of apoptosis. The definition of the role of these new drugs alone or in combination with established chemotherapy regimens in adequately designed prospective trials represents one of the major challenges in clinical lymphoma research.",cancer
"Randomized, double-blind study on role of low level nitrogen laser therapy in treatment failure tubercular lymphadenopathy, sinuses and cold abscess. BACKGROUND: Effectiveness of low level nitrogen laser therapy along with antitubercular treatment (ATT) in cases of treatment failure and drug resistant tubercular lymphadenopathy, sinuses and cold abscess. METHODS: In a double-blind randomized controlled trial of LLLT, 104 patients assigned to either the low level nitrogen laser therapy along with ATT (LLLT group) (n = 54) or ATT only (Chemotherapy group) (n = 50). Both groups were treated two times per week for five weeks. Those in the treatment group received pulse nitrogen laser with a pulse duration of seven nanosecond, wave length 337 nanometer and average power output of 5 mW whereas those in the control group were treated with sham laser. The primary outcome measure was bacteriological conversion and the secondary outcome measures were decrease in size of lesion and the clinical improvement. RESULTS: Acid Fast Bacilli (AFB) smear, AFB culture and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) conversion rate at five weeks (after 10 sittings of laser) were 49.15%( Fishers P exact test-p = 0.015), 60%, 44.44% (Fishers P exact test-p = 0.048) in LLLT group as compared to 11.86%, 20%,17.77% in chemotherapy group. Average percentage reduction in the size of gland at 5 weeks was 70.67% (p value 0.01) as compared to 54.81 in chemotherapy group. Average time taken for closure of sinuses was 11.03 weeks in LLLT group as compared to 26 weeks in chemotherapy group. The follow up was conducted for two years. CONCLUSION: Low level nitrogen laser therapy can be used as an adjunctive therapy along with antitubercular drugs in cases not responding and drug resistant tubercular lymphadenopathy, sinuses and cold abscess.",nocancer
"TP53 gene polymorphisms and breast cancer in Croatian women: a pilot study. A case-control retrospective association study was conducted to investigate a possible association of the TP53 polymorphisms, Arg72Pro and PIN3 (+16bp), with sporadic breast cancer in Croatian women. Ninety-five women with breast cancer and 108 age-matched healthy women were analyzed. Arg72Pro polymorphism was detected by TaqMan essay. For designation of PIN3 (+16bp) polymorphism DNA amplification was performed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) while the PCR products were detected by capillary electrophoresis. Homozygous genotype of minor allele of the PIN3 (+16bp) polymorphism was associated with sporadic breast cancer (OR = 2.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.80-2.56, p = 0.006). For Arg72 polymorphism, the odds ratio for breast cancer of ArgPro versus reference genotype ArgArg was 0.55 (95% CI 0.30-1.02, p = 0.039) suggesting the protective effect. Although different haplotypes did not influence the susceptibility to the disease, the joint occurrence of genotype combination ProPro/A2A2 frequent in cases, was associated with sporadic breast cancer (OR = 2.20, 95% CI 1.89-2.56, p = 0.021). The study provides evidence of the association of the TP53 gene polymorphisms Arg72Pro and PIN3 (+16bp) with sporadic breast cancer in the Croatian population.",cancer

"Similarities between Prescott Lecky's theory of self-consistency and Carl Rogers' self-theory. The teachings of Prescott Lecky on the self-concept at Columbia University in the 1920s and 1930s and the posthumous publications of his book on self-consistency beginning in 1945 are compared with the many publications of Carl Rogers on the self-concept beginning in the early 1940s. Given that Rogers was a graduate student at Columbia in the 1920s and 1930s, the striking similarities between these two theorists, as well as claims attributed to Rogers by Rogers' biographers and writers who have quoted Rogers on his works relating to self-theory, strongly suggest that Rogers borrowed from Lecky without giving him the proper credit. Much of Rogers' writings on the self-concept included not only terms and concepts which were original with Lecky, but at times these were actually identical.",nocancer
"Fine needle aspiration cytology of a cutaneous metastasis from an extraadrenal paraganglioma: a case report. BACKGROUND: Pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas are rare tumors originating from neuroectodermic cells, which metastasize in only 10% of cases. CASE: A case of cutaneous metastasis of an extramedullary paraganglioma was diagnosed by fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). A 39-year-old woman complained of a recently arisen subcutaneous nodule located on the scalp. Two years before she had suffered from a sporadic extraadrenal paraganglioma located on the sacrum, and it had been evaluated by FNAC. Smears were highly cellular and monomorphous; the cells were uniform and mainly isolated with round or ovoid nuclei, dense chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli, if any. The cytoplasm was ill defined, clear or granular. Oval-spindle-shaped cells and occasional cells with larger nuclei were also observed. Abundant fibrillar material was present in the background, intermingled with the surrounding cells. The immunocytochemical staining performed on cell block sections showed negativity for CK20, HMB45 and LCA and positivity for chromogranin and S100. The cytologic diagnosis was a neuroendocrine tumor, consistent with a metastasis from the former sacral paraganglioma. CONCLUSION: On conventional samples the cytologic features of paraganglioma are typical enough to allow a cytologic diagnosis of a neuroendocrine tumor; this neoplasm should be considered in the differential diagnosis, even in such unusual locations, because of its unpredictable biologic behavior.",cancer

"Body-mass index and mortality among 1.46 million white adults. BACKGROUND: A high body-mass index (BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) is associated with increased mortality from cardiovascular disease and certain cancers, but the precise relationship between BMI and all-cause mortality remains uncertain. METHODS: We used Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for an association between BMI and all-cause mortality, adjusting for age, study, physical activity, alcohol consumption, education, and marital status in pooled data from 19 prospective studies encompassing 1.46 million white adults, 19 to 84 years of age (median, 58). RESULTS: The median baseline BMI was 26.2. During a median follow-up period of 10 years (range, 5 to 28), 160,087 deaths were identified. Among healthy participants who never smoked, there was a J-shaped relationship between BMI and all-cause mortality. With a BMI of 22.5 to 24.9 as the reference category, hazard ratios among women were 1.47 (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 1.33 to 1.62) for a BMI of 15.0 to 18.4; 1.14 (95% CI, 1.07 to 1.22) for a BMI of 18.5 to 19.9; 1.00 (95% CI, 0.96 to 1.04) for a BMI of 20.0 to 22.4; 1.13 (95% CI, 1.09 to 1.17) for a BMI of 25.0 to 29.9; 1.44 (95% CI, 1.38 to 1.50) for a BMI of 30.0 to 34.9; 1.88 (95% CI, 1.77 to 2.00) for a BMI of 35.0 to 39.9; and 2.51 (95% CI, 2.30 to 2.73) for a BMI of 40.0 to 49.9. In general, the hazard ratios for the men were similar. Hazard ratios for a BMI below 20.0 were attenuated with longer-term follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In white adults, overweight and obesity (and possibly underweight) are associated with increased all-cause mortality. All-cause mortality is generally lowest with a BMI of 20.0 to 24.9.",nocancer

"Radiofrequency ablation for benign aldosterone-producing adenoma: a scarless technique to an old disease. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in treating primary aldosteronism (PA) due to aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA). BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency ablation is an established technique for treating malignant solid organ neoplasm. Its application on benign functional adrenal adenoma has never been prospectively described. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated a patient cohort with computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous RFA performed on functional APA of size 4 cm or less. Treatment success was defined as complete tumor ablation on follow-up CT scan plus normalization of serum aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) at 3 to 6 months after RFA. Salvage laparoscopic adrenalectomy was offered to patients who had failed RFA and remained hypertensive. RESULTS: Between August 2004 and August 2008, 28 patients were referred for the procedure. Radiofrequency ablation was not performed on 4 APA because of their close proximity to major vascular structures. Twenty-four patients (11 men and 13 women) with a median age of 51.5 (range = 34-63) years underwent RFA for 11 right and 13 left APA. The median tumor diameter was 16.0 (range = 4.0-25.0) mm. There was no periprocedure hypertensive crisis or major morbidity or mortality. Minor complications occurred in 4 patients (16.7%), including 1 small pneumothorax and 3 retroperitoneal hematomas (< 3 cm), which all resolved on conservative treatment. At 3 to 6 months of follow-up, CT scan showed complete tumor ablation in all patients (100%). Primary aldosteronism was biochemically resolved in 23 patients (95.8%). Salvage adrenalectomy was not performed in the single failed patient, as she remained normotensive on repeated follow-up. The overall success rate of RFA was 95.8%. CONCLUSIONS: Computed tomography-guided percutaneous RFA is a safe and efficacious alternative to laparoscopic adrenalectomy in treating patients with PA due to small APA.",cancer

"Hypertension in the elderly. Hypertension is a common problem in the elderly. Its prevalence is currently 60%-80%, but it is estimated that it will increase with the projected population growth of older people aged more than 65 years. Hypertension is a major cardiovascular risk factor due to the well-known continuous relationship between high blood pressure, stroke and cardiovascular (CV) mortality in all age groups. Because of the expected increasing proportion of older people, a further increase in CV and renal complications of hypertension in the next few decades can be predicted. In the elderly, systolic blood pressure increases because of arterial stiffness produced by structural alterations of arterial wall occurring with aging. On the other hand, in people aged 60 years and over, diastolic blood pressure remains unchanged or decreases. Isolated systolic hypertension and high pulse pressure are thus prevalent, and are important risk factors for stroke, coronary heart disease and all-cause mortality in the elderly and very elderly. The efficacy of therapy in older patients with systolic and diastolic hypertension or with isolated systolic hypertension, in terms of reduction of cardiovascular morbility and mortality, have been widely confirmed by many controlled and randomized clinical trials.",nocancer
"Disabled-2 downregulation promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. BACKGROUND: Metastatic tumour cells are characterised by acquisition of migratory and invasive properties; properties shared by cells, which have undergone epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Disabled-2 (Dab2) is a putative tumour suppressor whose expression has been shown to be downregulated in various cancer types including breast cancer; however, its exact function in suppressing tumour initiation or progression is unclear. METHODS: Disabled-2 isoform expression was determined by RT-PCR analysis in human normal and breast tumour samples. Using shRNA-mediated technology, Dab2 was stably downregulated in two cell model systems representing nontumourigenic human mammary epithelial cells. These cells were characterised for expression of EMT markers by RT-PCR and western blot analysis. RESULTS: Decreased expression of the p96 and p67 isoforms of Dab2 is observed in human breast tumour samples in comparison to normal human breast tissue. Decreased Dab2 expression in normal mammary epithelial cells leads to the appearance of a constitutive EMT phenotype. Disabled-2 downregulation leads to increased Ras/MAPK signalling, which facilitates the establishment of an autocrine transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) signalling loop, concomitant with increased expression of the TGFbeta2 isoform. CONCLUSION: Loss of Dab2 expression, commonly observed in breast cancer, may facilitate TGFbeta-stimulated EMT, and therefore increase the propensity for metastasis.",cancer

"Awareness and compliance with recommended running shoe guidelines among U.S. Army soldiers. The purpose of this study was to determine awareness and compliance with recommended running shoe selection, sizing, and replacement guidelines among U.S. Army soldiers. Soldiers (n = 524) attending training at Fort Sam Houston, Texas completed self-report questionnaires and a foot assessment, which included measurement of foot size and arch height index. Researchers examined each soldier's running shoes for type, wear pattern, and general condition. Thirty-five percent of the soldiers wore shoes that were inappropriately sized; 56.5% wore shoes that were inappropriate for their foot type. Thirty-five percent of the soldiers had excessively worn shoes and 63% did not know recommended shoe replacement guidelines. Further efforts may be necessary to ensure that soldiers are aware of and compliant with recommended running shoe selection, sizing, and replacement guidelines. Future research is needed to determine whether adherence to these guidelines has a favorable effect on reducing risk of overuse injury.",nocancer

Rates of sudden, unexplained death were estimated. The very high autopsy rate in the cohort allowed for a specific diagnosis in almost all subjects. RESULTS: Sixty subjects died (24%); this rate is three times as high as the expected age- and sex-adjusted mortality in the general population. The subjects who died included 51 of 107 subjects (48%) who were not in 5-year terminal remission (i.e., >/=5 years seizure-free at the time of death or last follow-up). A remote symptomatic cause of epilepsy (i.e., a major neurologic impairment or insult) was also associated with an increased risk of death as compared with an idiopathic or cryptogenic cause (37% vs. 12%, P<0.001). Of the 60 deaths, 33 (55%) were related to epilepsy, including sudden, unexplained death in 18 subjects (30%), definite or probable seizure in 9 (15%), and accidental drowning in 6 (10%). The deaths that were not related to epilepsy occurred primarily in subjects with remote symptomatic epilepsy. The cumulative risk of sudden, unexplained death was 7% at 40 years overall and 12% in an analysis that was limited to subjects who were not in long-term remission and not receiving medication. Among subjects with idiopathic or cryptogenic epilepsy, there were no sudden, unexplained deaths in subjects younger than 14 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood-onset epilepsy was associated with a substantial risk of epilepsy-related death, including sudden, unexplained death. The risk was especially high among children who were not in remission. (Funded by the Finnish Epilepsy Research Foundation.).",nocancer
"Thyroid transcription factor-1 expression in breast carcinomas. Immunostaining for thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) is frequently used to help assess the site of origin of metastatic carcinomas. TTF-1 expression is most frequently seen in carcinomas of thyroid and lung origin. Furthermore, it has been assumed that the expression of TTF-1 in a carcinoma excludes the possibility of a breast origin. We have recently encountered in our consultation practice 4 cases of invasive breast carcinoma (confirmed by clinical findings and other immunophenotypic features) that showed unequivocal tumor cell expression of TTF-1. However, the frequency with which TTF-1 expression is observed in breast carcinomas is unknown. To address this, we carried out immunostaining for TTF-1 on 546 primary breast carcinomas submitted for routine estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and/or HER2 testing. Cases were considered TTF-1 positive if they showed any nuclear staining for this marker. TTF-1 expression was identified in 13 cases (2.4%). Expression varied from focal and weak to diffuse and strong and was seen in both invasive and in situ components. We conclude that a small proportion of breast carcinomas show TTF-1 expression. Therefore, the presence of TTF-1 immunoreactivity in a carcinoma cannot by itself be used to exclude the possibility of a breast origin.",cancer
"A new index of hemodialysis adequacy: clearance x dialysis time / bioelectrical resistance. BACKGROUND: Kt/V urea was established as an index of hemodialysis (HD) adequacy. The use of V urea (as derived by the Watson et al formulae) as a normalizing factor has been questioned, and alternative parameters such as body weight 0.67 (W 0.67), body surface area (BSA), resting energy expenditure (REE), high metabolic rate organ (HMRO) mass and liver size (LV) have been proposed (respective HD adequacy indices: Kt/W 0.67, Kt/BSA, Kt/REE, Kt/HMRO and Kt/LV). METHODS: The present study aimed to calculate the 6 previously described normalizing factors (all obtained utilizing anthropometric variables) and to measure bioelectrical resistance (R), an independent and directly achievable biological parameter, in 481 white, disease-free individuals and 270 white prevalent HD patients, pair-matched by age, body weight and height, after stratification by sex. Further, we aimed to evaluate the effect of substituting BSA, W 0.67, REE, HMRO, LV and R for V urea as denominator in Kt/V urea on the distribution of target dialysis dose in a cohort of 1,058 white prevalent HD patients. All individuals underwent 1 single-frequency bioelectrical impedance measurement, on the nondominant side of the body, injecting 800 muA at 50 kHz alternating sinusoidal current with a standard tetrapolar technique. RESULTS: When comparing pair-matched disease-free men and women with HD men and women, respectively, only R was statistically significantly different (p<0.0001 and p<0.02, respectively). As expected, V urea, BSA, W 0.67, REE, HMRO and LV were not significantly different in both comparisons. Furthermore, equivalent Kt/R for a range of prescribed Kt/V urea was able to give a more clearcut differentiation among sexes and body sizes, when compared with the other methods for scaling dialysis dose. CONCLUSIONS: BSA, W 0.67, REE, HMRO and LV, as well as V urea are derived by means of calculations which utilize anthropometric variables. In contrast, R is a biological parameter which can be directly measured in the clinical setting by means of a simple, low-cost, fast and repeatable procedure. Even though Kt/R is probably the most appropriate method for scaling dialysis dose among those evaluated in the present study, further work is required to develop these concepts and translate them into rigorous outcome-based adequacy targets suitable for clinical usage.",nocancer

An evaluation of the young people's knowledge regarding the ophthalmic effects of smoking. PURPOSE: To assess the young people's knowledge regarding the ophthalmic effects of smoking. METHODS: 198 students (111 males and 87 females) with a mean age of 27 years old (+/- 6 years) participated in the study. A simple questionnaire was used and the participants were requested to fill out the questionnaire themselves. RESULTS: 77% (152) of the participants were smokers. 67% (130) have never heard about the adverse effect of smoking to the eyes. 87% (172) have not heard about the relationship between smoking and thyroid eye disease. 84% (166) were not aware that smoking could ccontribute to the formation of cataract. 50% (99) have no knowledge about the association between smoking and age-related macular degeneration. 80% (158) were unaware that smoking is a risk factor for visual loss. CONCLUSIONS: The level of knowledge of young people regarding the ophthalmic effects of smoking is not satisfactory. There is an urgent need to promote the awareness of the population regarding the adverse effect of smoking on visual function.,nocancer
"Pulmonary function in school-aged children with mild to moderate infant respiratory distress syndrome requiring nasal continuous positive airway pressure. OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to evaluate whether mild to moderate infant respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) treated with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) might affect the pulmonary function in school-aged children. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 50 children, aged 10.2 +/- 2.8 years, with a history of RDS and 90 controls without a neonatal history of lung diseases, matched for age and gestational age at birth, were studied. Pulmonary function was assessed by spirometry and oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximeter RESULTS: The incidence of respiratory tract infections within the first 6 years after discharge from the intensive care neonatal unit was higher in the RDS group than in controls (P < 0.05). Spirometric parameters of the pulmonary function were comparable in both groups. Oxygen saturation was significantly lower in the RDS group (96.2 +/- 7 vs. 97.3 +/- 7%; P < 0.05). A significant negative correlation between spirometric parameters and the duration of NCPAP application and the duration of oxygen supplementation has been found. CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary function assessed by spirometry was normal in school-aged children with infant RDS. However; spirometric parameters were negatively correlated with the duration of NCPAP and the duration of oxygen supplementation. In comparison with the controls, children with infant RDS had a higher incidence of respiratory tract infections (laryngitis, acute bronchitis and pneumonia) within the first 6 years of life, as well as lower oxygen saturation.",nocancer
"A report of three consecutive pregnancies in a kidney transplant recipient and the challenges in their management in a poor resource setting. Kidney transplant recipients (KTR) have a good outcome of pregnancies. However the mother and the child are increasingly at higher risks of complications compared to the general population. The management of these pregnancies is associated with greater challenges and is better if managed by both the obstetrician and the transplant physician. Kidney transplant is available in few centres in Nigeria and the post transplant population is increasing, but to our knowledge no report on pregnancy management in KTR has been published. We present a 25 years old Nigerian who had a live related kidney transplant and later had 3 consecutive pregnancies and review the relevant literature. She was placed on oral contraceptive pills for 2 years after transplantation. She enjoyed a stable allograft function with no rejection episode, no proteinuria, had a good blood pressure control and pelvic ultrasound scan was essentially normal. She conceived her first pregnancy 26 months post transplant however she developed spontaneous abortion at 3 months gestation. She conceived her second pregnancy 33 months post transplant which was supervised by the obstetrician and the transplant physician. She had complications including urinary tract infection, anaemia and dyslipidaemia and delivered a live baby girl weighing 2.4 Kg by spontaneous vaginal delivery at 36 weeks gestation. She conceived her 3rd pregnancy 8 months later which was also carried to term and had a vaginal delivery of a live baby girl weighing 2.55 kg.

"Regression toward the mean or heuristic processing in detecting deception? Reply to Elaad (2010). Masip, et al. (2009) conducted a study in which observers had to make truth-lie judgments at the beginning, middle, or end of a series of videotaped statements. They found a decline in truth judgments over time and explained this finding in terms of information processing mode. Recently, Elaad (2010) challenged this explanation and contended that the decline could be a result of regression toward the mean. In the present paper, it is argued that because Masip, et al. took multiple Moment 1 judgments over time and then averaged across judgments, regression toward the mean was extremely unlikely. Furthermore, the decrease in truth judgments was found under several separate conditions; this cannot be explained by random fluctuations alone. Finally, Masip, et al.'s data were re-analyzed adjusting for the effects of regression toward the mean. The outcomes of these analyses were the same as those reported in the original article.",nocancer
"Multimodality imaging and preclinical evaluation of 177Lu-AMBA for human prostate tumours in a murine model. AMBA (DO3A-CH(2)CO-G-(4-aminobenzoyl)-QWAVGHLM-NH(2)) is a bombesin (BN)-like peptide having high affinity with gastrin-releasing peptide receptors (GRPr).(177)Lu-AMBA is currently undergoing clinical trial as a systemic radiotherapy for hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) patients. This study evaluated the biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, bioluminescent imaging (BLI) and microSPECT/CT imaging of (177)Lu-AMBA in PC-3M-luc-C6 luciferase-expressing human prostate tumour-bearing mice. Plasma stability of (177)Lu-AMBA could be maintained up to 55.67+/-6.07% at 24 h in a protection buffer. High positive correlations of PC-3M luc-C6 tumour growth in SCID mice between caliper measurement and BLI were observed (R(2)=0.999). Both the biodistribution and microSPECT/CT imaging in PC-3M-luc-C6 bearing-tumour mice showed that (177)Lu-AMBA in tumour uptake could be retained for 24 h. The distribution half-life (t(1/2alpha)) and the elimination half-life (t(1/2beta)) of (177) Lu-AMBA in mice were 0.52 h and 26.6 h, respectively. These results indicated that BLI could be used to monitor the growth of tumour. High uptake of (177)Lu-AMBA in PC-3M-luc-C6 tumour-bearing mice by microSPECT/CT imaging can further evaluate the potential of (177)Lu-AMBA therapy for PC-3M-luc-C6 tumours.",cancer
"Screening programmes for the early detection and prevention of oral cancer. BACKGROUND: Oral cancer is an important global healthcare problem, its incidence is increasing and late-stage presentation is common. Screening programmes have been introduced for a number of major cancers and have proved effective in their early detection. Given the high morbidity and mortality rates associated with oral cancer, there is a need to determine the effectiveness of a screening programme for this disease, either as a targeted, opportunistic or population based measure. Evidence exists from modelled data that a visual oral examination of high-risk individuals may be a cost-effective screening strategy and the development and use of adjunctive aids and biomarkers is becoming increasingly common. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of current screening methods in decreasing oral cancer mortality. SEARCH STRATEGY: The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 20 May 2010), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 2), MEDLINE via OVID (1950 to 20 May 2010), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 20 May 2010) and CANCERLIT via PubMed (1950 to 20 May 2010). There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of screening for oral cancer or potentially malignant disorders using visual examination, toluidine blue, fluorescence imaging or brush biopsy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The original review identified 1389 citations and this update identified an additional 330 studies, highlighting 1719 studies for consideration. Only one study met the inclusion criteria and validity assessment, data extraction and statistics evaluation were undertaken by six independent review authors. MAIN RESULTS: One 9-year RCT has been included (n = 13 clusters: 191,873 participants). There was no statistically significant difference in the age-standardised oral cancer mortality rates for the screened group (16.4/100,000 person-years) and the control group (20.7/100,000 person-years). A 43% reduction in mortality was reported between the intervention cohort (29.9/100,000 person-years) and the control arm (45.4/100,000) for high-risk individuals who used tobacco or alcohol or both, which was statistically significant. However, this study had a number of methodological weaknesses and the associated risk of bias was high. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Although there is evidence that a visual examination as part of a population based screening programme reduced the mortality rate of oral cancer in high-risk individuals, whilst producing a stage shift and improvement in survival rates across the population as a whole, the evidence is limited to one study and is associated with a high risk of bias. This was compounded by the fact that the effect of cluster randomisation was not accounted for in the analysis. Furthermore, no robust evidence was identified to support the use of other adjunctive technologies like toluidine blue, brush biopsy or fluorescence imaging within a primary care environment. Further randomised controlled trials are recommended to assess the efficacy, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a visual examination as part of a population based screening programme.",cancer
"Repeatability of metabolically active volume measurements with 18F-FDG and 18F-FLT PET in non-small cell lung cancer. In addition to tumor size measurements with CT, there is a need for quantitative measurements of metabolic active volumes, possibly adding to tracer uptake measurements in oncologic response evaluation with PET. The aim of this study was to evaluate the metabolic volume test-retest variability in (18)F-FDG and 3'-deoxy-3'-(18)F-fluorothymidine ((18)F-FLT) PET studies for various commonly used volumes of interest (VOIs) and the dependence of that variability on lesion size and relative radiotracer uptake. METHODS: Twenty non-small cell lung cancer patients were scanned twice with (18)F-FDG (n = 11) or (18)F-FLT (n = 9). VOIs were defined on images reconstructed with normalization- and attenuation-weighted ordered-subset expectation maximization using 4 isocontours (A41%, A50%, and A70% thresholds, adapted for local background, and 50% threshold, uncorrected for background). Statistical analysis comprised intraclass correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS: In the (18)F-FDG and (18)F-FLT groups, 34 and 20 lesions, respectively, were analyzed. Median volumes at the A50% threshold were 3.31 and 2.19 mL (interquartile range, 1.91-8.90 and 1.52-7.27 mL) for (18)F-FDG and (18)F-FLT, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficients were greater than 0.9, with the exception of the A70%-based metabolic volumes for (18)F-FLT. For lesions greater than 4.2 mL, repeatability coefficients (RCs = 1.96 x SD) of the percentage difference ranged from 22% to 37% for (18)F-FDG and from 39% to 73% for (18)F-FLT, depending on the VOI method being used. Repeatability was better for larger tumors, but there was no dependence on absolute uptake (standardized uptake value). CONCLUSION: Results indicate that changes of greater than 37% for (18)F-FDG and greater than 73% for (18)F-FLT (1.96 x SD) for lesions with A50% metabolic volumes greater than 4.2 mL represent a biologic effect. For smaller lesions (A50% VOI < 4.2 mL), an absolute change of 1.0 and 0.9 mL for (18)F-FDG and (18)F-FLT, respectively, is biologically relevant. Considering the balance between the success rate of automatic tumor delineation and repeatability of metabolic volume, a 50% threshold with correction for local background activity (A50%) seems optimal among the VOI methods evaluated.",cancer
"Evaluation of HER-2/neu gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry in saudi female breast cancer. BACKGROUND: Amplification of the HER-2/neu oncogene and concomitant over-expression of its protein are detected in approximately 18% of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast and is associated with poor prognosis. This study tested the use of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to evaluate the HER-2/neu gene status and to ascertain the concordance rate between the two methods. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty two tumour samples containing representative tumour were divided for testing using each assay. HER-2/neu gene amplification is scored as a ratio of HER-2/neu gene amplification to chromosome 17. The ratio should be >2.2 to be considered as positive. 20 cells should be counted and an average score taken. An extra 20 cells should be counted if the ratio is between 1.8-2.2. RESULTS: Seventy five effective samples were used. HER-2/neu gene was amplified in 19 out of 75 cases (25%) whereas, HER-2 protein, by IHC was over-expressed in 18 out of 75 cases (24%). In the 44 negative cases by IHC analysis only 7 cases (16%) of them showed amplification by FISH. Three out of 13 cases (23 %) scored as +2 showed gene amplification by FISH while 9 cases out of 18 cases (50%) were scored as +3. High concordance with FISH results 37:44 (84 %) was noted in negative cases (0/+1 cases), while lower concordance 3:13 (23 %) was seen in +2 cases. CONCLUSION: This study revealed a significant concordance between FISH results and IHC results. The study also showed that HER2/neu amplification is higher in Saudi patients than other western populations. However, due to the inherent failures of the IHC assay, FISH should always be used when the IHC results are inconclusive. The rational algorithm for HER-2/neu testing would be to perform IHC first, followed by FISH to validate equivocal IHC results.",cancer
"The effect of shoulder immobilization on balance in community-dwelling older adults. PURPOSE: Shoulder immobilization devices are commonly used in the treatment of older adults following proximal humeral fractures. Immobilization of the shoulder may have a negative effect on balance, which could increase risk for falls. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of shoulder immobilization on balance in the community-dwelling older adult population as measured by the Berg Balance Scale (BBS). METHODS: Fifty-three subjects (14 men and 39 women, mean age = 75.4 years) participated in the study. The BBS was administered twice to each participant. Subjects were tested once while wearing a shoulder immobilizer and once without a shoulder immobilizer. The immobilizer positioned the elbow at 90 degrees of flexion and anchored the arm to the trunk. The Wilcoxon signed-ranks test was used to evaluate differences in BBS scores. A 2-tailed test was performed with a set at .05. RESULTS: Mean (SD) BBS scores were 53 (4.0) without the immobilizer and 52 (4.7) with the immobilizer. BBS change scores (score with immobilizer minus score without immobilizer) ranged from +1 to -7, with a mean change score of -1.02. The Wilcoxon signed-ranks test indicated a significant difference between paired observations (negative ranks = 29, positive ranks = 6, P < .0001). Balance was impaired (significantly lower BBS scores) when subjects wore the device compared with the testing sessions without the device. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that immobilizing the shoulder may have a negative effect on balance as measured by the BBS. If shoulder immobilization places an individual at greater risk for falls, early balance screening by a physical therapist to determine the appropriateness of a fall prevention program may be indicated.",nocancer
"Simultaneous bilateral versus unilateral total ankle replacement: a patient-based comparison of pain relief, quality of life and functional outcome. The aim of this study was to compare the outcome of bilateral sequential total ankle replacement (TAR) with that of unilateral TAR. We reviewed 23 patients who had undergone sequential bilateral TAR under a single anaesthetic and 46 matched patients with a unilateral TAR. There were no significant pre-operative differences between the two groups in terms of age, gender, body mass index, American Society of Anaesthesiologists classification and aetiology of the osteoarthritis of the ankle. Clinical and radiological follow-up was carried out at four months, one and two years. After four months, patients with simultaneous bilateral TAR reported a significantly higher mean pain score than those with a unilateral TAR. The mean American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society hindfoot score and short-form 36 physical component summary score were better in the unilateral group. However, this difference disappeared at the one-and two-year follow-ups. Bilateral sequential TAR under one anaesthetic can be offered to patients with bilateral severe ankle osteoarthritis.

"Cobalt ions induce chemokine secretion in a variety of systemic cell lines. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Metal ion toxicity both locally and systemically following MoM hip replacements remains a concern. Cobalt ions have been shown to induce secretion of proinflammatory chemokines locally; however, little is known about their effect systemically. We investigated the in vitro effect of cobalt ions on a variety of cell lines by measuring production of the proinflammatory chemokines IL-8 and MCP-1. METHOD: Renal, gastrointestinal, and respiratory epithelium and also neutrophils and monocytes were exposed to cobalt ions at 4, 12, 24, and 48 hours. RESULTS: We found that cobalt ions enhanced the secretion of IL-8 and MCP-1 in renal epithelial cells, gastric and colon epithelium, monocytes and neutrophils, and small airway epithelial cells but not in alveolar cells. Secretion of IL-8 and MCP-1 was markedly elevated in renal epithelium, where a 16-fold and 7-fold increase occurred compared to controls. There was a 6-fold and 4-fold increase in IL-8 and MCP-1 secretion in colon epithelium and a 4-fold and 3-fold increase in gastric epithelium. Small airway epithelial cells showed a maximum increase in secretion of 8-fold (IL-8) and of 4-fold (MCP-1). The increase in chemokine secretion observed in alveolar cells was moderate and did not reach statistical significance. Monocytes and neutrophils showed a 2.5-fold and 2-fold increase in IL-8 secretion and a 6-fold and 4-fold increase in MCP-1 secretion at 48 and 24 hours, respectively. INTERPRETATION: These data demonstrate the potent bioactivity of cobalt ions in a variety of cell types and the potential to induce a proinflammatory response.",nocancer

"MET signalling: principles and functions in development, organ regeneration and cancer. The MET tyrosine kinase receptor (also known as the HGF receptor) promotes tissue remodelling, which underlies developmental morphogenesis, wound repair, organ homeostasis and cancer metastasis, by integrating growth, survival and migration cues in response to environmental stimuli or cell-autonomous perturbations. The versatility of MET-mediated biological responses is sustained by qualitative and quantitative signal modulation. Qualitative mechanisms include the engagement of dedicated signal transducers and the subcellular compartmentalization of MET signalling pathways, whereas quantitative regulation involves MET partnering with adaptor amplifiers or being degraded through the shedding of its extracellular domain or through intracellular ubiquitylation. Controlled activation of MET signalling can be exploited in regenerative medicine, whereas MET inhibition might slow down tumour progression.",cancer
"Deep vein thrombosis: review and update. Deep vein thrombosis is a common and serious medical condition, which frequently complicates the postoperative recovery of surgical patients with recognised/unrecognised risk factors. The pathophysiology of formation of blood clots in veins of lower extremities has now come in light after development of newer investigations. Newer imaging techniques allow the evaluation of peripheral venous system, which was previously unavailable. Pulmonary embolism remains the major early complication of deep vein thrombosis, although postphlebitic syndrome and recurrent deep vein thrombosis are other major complications. The risk of both pulmonary embolism and postphlebitic syndrome escalates in patients with recurrent deep vein thrombosis. Thus a correct evaluation of patients at high risk and proper management is mandatory.

The aim of the study was to examine signs and symptoms related to temporomandibular disorders (TMD) in patients with eating disorders (ED) and to compare the prevalence with that in sex- and age-matched controls. During a 12-month period, all patients (n = 65) who accepted and initiated psychiatric/medical outpatient treatment in an Eating Disorder Clinic/Erikbergsgarden, Orebro, Sweden were invited to participate in the study. Of the ED patients, 54 (83%) accepted participation. ED patients and controls underwent a comprehensive TMD questionnaire and clinical examination. Reported symptoms such as headache, facial pain,jaw tiredness, tongue thrusting, and lump feeling in the throat as well as dizziness, concentration difficulties and sleep disturbances were all significantly more prevalent among ED patients compared to controls. There was also a significantly higher prevalence of clinical TMD signs in the ED patients. Analyses within the ED group showed that those who reported self-induced vomiting reported significantly more heavy feeling in the head, nausea and snoring. Those with binge eating reported significantly more heavy feeling in the head, facial pain, dizzy feeling and concentration difficulties. No significant differences regarding subjective symptoms and clinical signs of TMD were found within the ED group with respect to duration of ED. In conclusion, orofacial pain and TMD related signs and symptoms are significantly more common in ED patients than in matched control subjects.

"Germline epigenetic regulation of KILLIN in Cowden and Cowden-like syndrome. CONTEXT: Germline loss-of-function phosphatase and tensin homolog gene (PTEN) mutations cause 80% of Cowden syndrome, a rare autosomal-dominant disorder (1 in 200,000 live births), characterized by high risks of breast, thyroid, and other cancers. A large heterogeneous group of individuals with Cowden-like syndrome, who have various combinations of Cowden syndrome features but who do not meet Cowden syndrome diagnostic criteria, have PTEN mutations less than 10% of the time, making molecular diagnosis, prediction, genetic counseling, and risk management challenging. Other mechanisms of loss of function such as hypermethylation, which should result in underexpression of PTEN or of KILLIN, a novel tumor suppressor transcribed in the opposite direction, may account for the remainder of Cowden syndrome and Cowden-like syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether germline methylation is found in Cowden syndrome or Cowden-like syndrome in individuals lacking germline PTEN mutations. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Nucleic acids from prospective nested series of 123 patients with Cowden syndrome or Cowden-like syndrome and 50 unaffected individuals without PTEN variants were analyzed for germline methylation and expression of PTEN and KILLIN at the Cleveland Clinic, August 2008-June 2010. Prevalence of component cancers between groups was compared using the Fisher exact test. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency of germline methylation in PTEN mutation-negative Cowden syndrome and Cowden syndrome-like individuals. Prevalence of component cancers in methylation-positive and PTEN mutation-positive individuals. RESULTS: Of 123 patients with Cowden syndrome or Cowden-like syndrome, 45 (37%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 29%-45%) showed hypermethylation upstream of PTEN but no transcriptional repression. The germline methylation was found to transcriptionally down-regulate KILLIN by 250-fold (95% CI, 45-14 286; P = .007) and exclusively disrupted TP53 activation of KILLIN by 30% (95% CI, 7%-45%; P = .008). Demethylation treatment increased only KILLIN expression 4.88-fold (95% CI, 1.4-18.1; P = .05). Individuals with KILLIN -promoter methylation had a 3-fold increased prevalence of breast cancer (35/42 vs 24/64; P < .0001) and a greater than 2-fold increase of kidney cancer (4/45 vs 6/155; P = .004) over individuals with germline PTEN mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Germline KILLIN methylation is common among patients with Cowden syndrome or Cowden-like syndrome and is associated with increased risks of breast and renal cancer over PTEN mutation-positive individuals. These observations need to be replicated.",cancer

BACKGROUND: Vascular tumors and malformations can be challenging to diagnose. Although they may initially appear very similar, they have distinct clinical courses and management. Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) gene expression has been reported in many different tumors including hematologic malignancies and some solid tumors. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the expression of WT1 in 126 vascular lesions (64 vascular tumors, one Masson tumor, and 61 vascular malformations). METHODS: Based on the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies classification of vascular anomalies, we studied the expression of WT1 in vascular tumors composed of infantile hemangioma, congenital hemangiomas (non-involuting, rapidly involuting, and not otherwise specified), pyogenic granuloma, tufted angioma, cherry angioma, Kaposi sarcoma, and angiosarcoma. We also studied WT1 expression in vascular malformations composed of angiokeratoma/verrucous hemangioma, combined vascular malformations, venous malformations, glomuvenous malformations, lymphatic malformations/lymphangioma, telangiectasia, and targetoid hemosiderotic hemangioma. RESULTS: All vascular tumors and proliferations had positive WT1 cytoplasmic endothelial immunostaining whereas only 3 vascular malformations were WT1 positive. Moreover the positivity of WT1 in these vascular malformations was focal and involved only re-endothelialized neovessels within thrombi. LIMITATIONS: The low number of malignant vascular tumors is a limitation. CONCLUSIONS: Immunohistochemical detection of WT1 could be a useful tool to routine evaluation of vascular anomalies allowing the distinction of vascular tumors and proliferations from vascular malformations. Staining for WT1 may guide the clinician in difficult cases, as positive results would suggest a proliferative vascular lesion whereas negative results might point to a vascular malformation.",cancer
"Improving geocoding outcomes for the Nebraska Cancer Registry: learning from proven practices. This report summarizes geocoding improvement experiments in the Nebraska Cancer Registry. An initial assessment of previous geocoding suggests that some proven geocoding procedures have not been followed, and overall results were unacceptable. This study concluded that when updating different address files from different time periods, it is sufficient to use the most recent street centerline database. The combination of match score of 80 and spelling sensitivity of 80 in ESRI's ArcGIS geocoder is sufficient for most geocoding purposes. Given the sizable number of unmatched addresses, the Google Maps geocoding service was used. A comparison of 1500 high-quality addresses that were matched by both Google Maps and ArcGIS geocoders shows that, in most cases, the location discrepancies between the two were acceptable. The median distance between each pair of 1500 coded locations was 36.6 meters, with an average of 92.8 meters. Distance discrepancies were larger in urban fringe areas and smaller toward urban centers. It was concluded that by strictly following proven procedures including address coding specification, Internet-based White Pages for reverse address finding, and Internet-based geocoding, a 90% or even a 95% match rate is achievable.",cancer

"Adipocytokines in subjects with and without ischemic cerebrovascular disease. OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY: To investigate adipocytokines in patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease and to develop an association between them. METHODS: In this study plasma adiponectin, leptin and Interleukin 6 (IL 6) concentration were measured by ELISA. Blood glucose and lipid profile was done by standard kit methods. RESULTS: A total of 80 subjects with and without CVD were studied. The mean plasma level of IL6 of the forty patients with ischemic CVD was significantly higher than that of the forty subjects without CVD (41.64 + 2.50 versus 22.76 + 0.76 pg/mL; P < 0.001). The mean plasma level of adiponectin was significantly lower in patients with ischemic CVD than that of subjects without CVD (4.36 +/- 0.21 microg/mL versus 6.9 +/-0.241microg/mL; P < 0.001). Serum leptin concentrations were significantly higher (p < 0.001) in stroke patients (51.61 + 1.39) as compared with controls (37.76 + 1.207). Leptin levels were significantly negatively correlated with adiponectin (P < 0.01) and significantly positively correlated (P < 0.01) with interleukin 6 in stroke patients. CONCLUSION: Present report provides additional support to the evidence of involvement of cytokines in inflammatory immune response of patients with cerebrovascular disease.",nocancer
"Balancing the risk of postoperative surgical infections: a multivariate analysis of factors associated with laparoscopic appendectomy from the NSQIP database. OBJECTIVE: To establish the relationship between operative approach (laparoscopic or open) and subsequent surgical infection (both incisional and organ space infection) postappendectomy, independent of potential confounding factors. BACKGROUND: Although laparoscopic appendectomy has been associated with lower rates of incisional infections than an open approach, the relationship between laparoscopy and organ space infection (OSI) is not as clearly established. METHODS: Cases of appendectomy were retrieved from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) database for 2005 to 2008. Patient factors, operative variables, and the primary outcomes of incisional infections and OSIs were recorded. Factors associated with surgical infections were identified using logistic regression models. These models were then used to calculate probabilities of OSI in clinical vignettes demonstrating varying levels of infectious risk. RESULTS: A total of 39,950 appendectomy cases were included of which 30,575 (77%) were performed laparoscopically. On multivariate analysis, laparoscopy was associated with a lower risk of incisional infection [odds ratio (OR) 0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.32-0.43] but with an increased risk of OSI after adjustment for confounding factors (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.21-1.73). For a low-risk patient, probability of OSI was calculated to be 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively, for open versus laparoscopic appendectomy, whereas for a high-risk patient, probabilities were estimated at 8.9% and 12.3%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopy was associated with a decreased risk of incisional infection but with an increased risk of OSI. The degree of this increased risk varies depending on the clinical profile of a surgical patient. Recognition of these differences in risk may aid clinicians in the choice of operative approach for appendectomy.",nocancer
"Small molecule inhibition of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) binding to pleckstrin homology domains. The PI3-kinase (PI3K) pathway regulates many cellular processes, especially cell metabolism, cell survival, and apoptosis. Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), the product of PI3K activity and a key signaling molecule, acts by recruiting pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain-containing proteins to cell membranes. Here, we describe a new structural class of nonphosphoinositide small molecule antagonists (PITenins, PITs) of PIP3-PH domain interactions (IC(50) ranges from 13.4 to 31 muM in PIP3/Akt PH domain binding assay). PITs inhibit interactions of a number of PIP3-binding PH domains, including those of Akt and PDK1, without affecting several PIP2-selective PH domains. As a result, PITs suppress the PI3K-PDK1-Akt pathway and trigger metabolic stress and apoptosis. A PIT-1 analog displayed significant antitumor activity in vivo, including inhibition of tumor growth and induction of apoptosis. Overall, our studies demonstrate the feasibility of developing specific small molecule antagonists of PIP3 signaling.",cancer
"Cellular uptake of protein-bound magnetic nanoparticles in pulsed magnetic field. A method for fast delivery of proteins conjugated to superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) into mammalian cells by applying a strong magnetic field in pulses was proposed. Firstly, SPION were prepared from an alkaline solution of divalent and trivalent iron ions and covalently bound with protein through the activation of N-ethyl-N'-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC). After fluorescently labelling, the protein-nanoparticle conjugate was mixed with mammalian cell line and exposed to a pulsed magnetic field for short durations of few milliseconds. Results suggested that superparamagnetic nanoparticles were able to carry proteins into living cells immediately. Cellular internalization of the fluorescently labelled protein-nanoparticle conjugate was proved by the observation of cell fluorescence in a fluorescent microscopy, as well as cell analysis by a flow cytometer. We found that the cellular uptake was accomplished dominantly by the process of bombardment of magnetic nanoparticles.",nocancer
"Synergistic effects of topoisomerase I inhibitor, SN38, on Fas-mediated apoptosis. Inhibitors of topoisomerase I, such as camptothecin, have proven to be among the most promising new classes of anti-neoplastic agents introduced into the clinical setting in recent years. Irinotecan (CPT-11) is one of the most widely used camptothecin analogs and is converted to form the active metabolite SN-38. The present study was designed to explore apoptosis induced by SN38 and anti-Fas antibody (CH11) in WR/Fas-SMS1 cells and its possible mechanisms. The results demonstrate that combination of SN38 and CH11 synergistically enhanced cell apoptosis in WR/Fas-SMS1 cells. Western blotting analysis showed that combination of SN38 and CH11 activated the ATM-Chk1-p53 pathway, increased protein expression of phospho-p53 and cleavaged caspase-3, but down-regulated expression of phospho-p21. Our data suggest that combination of SN38 and CH11 enhanced apoptosis through down-regulation of p21 phosphorylation. In conclusion, inhibition of p21 could be a new adjuvant approach in cancer therapy.",cancer

"Duration of orthodontic treatment in conjunction with orthognathic surgery. Patients considering undergoing combined orthodontic-orthognathic treatment for correction of malocclusion require appropriate information, particularly with respect to duration of treatment. The primary aim of this study was to determine the duration of orthodontic treatment carried out in conjunction with orthognathic surgery and to analyze the influence of selected explanatory variables. A further aim was to compare the duration of orthodontic treatment in patients treated by orthodontists at Linkoping University hospital orthodontic clinic and six regional orthodontic clinics. This is a retrospective study, based on data from the orthodontic records of patients who had undergone orthognathic surgery at the University Hospital Maxillofacial Unit in Linkoping, Sweden, from 2000 to 2005. The subjects comprised 207 out of 233 patients (107 women and 100 men), aged 15.8-56.9 years, median 24.2 years at the time of surgery: 26 patients were excluded, either diagnosed with a syndrome, or because it was impossible to follow up the entire treatment. 59 subjects had undergone orthodontic treatment at the University hospital orthodontic clinic and 148 at the 6 regional orthodontic clinics. The variables recorded were gender, malocclusion, the number of appointments (scheduled and emergency) and treatment setting. The median value for pre-operative orthodontic treatment time was 19.2 months (range 2.4-68.4); for postoperative orthodontic treatment 4.6 months (range 0-18.8) and for total orthodontic treatment 27.8 months (range 5.9-79.1). For the University hospital orthodontic clinic, pre-operative (16.7 months) and total orthodontic treatment times (25 months) were significantly shorter than for the regional clinics; the duration of postoperative treatment was significantly longer (4.1 months). No other explanatory variables had a significant influence on the duration of orthodontic treatment. Compared with the regional orthodontic clinics, there were significantly fewer scheduled appointments at the University hospital orthodontic clinic, but no significant difference in emergency attendance.",nocancer
"Effects of aerobic and resistance training on hemoglobin A1c levels in patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomized controlled trial. CONTEXT: Exercise guidelines for individuals with diabetes include both aerobic and resistance training although few studies have directly examined this exercise combination. OBJECTIVE: To examine the benefits of aerobic training alone, resistance training alone, and a combination of both on hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) in individuals with type 2 diabetes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized controlled trial in which 262 sedentary men and women in Louisiana with type 2 diabetes and HbA(1c) levels of 6.5% or higher were enrolled in the 9-month exercise program between April 2007 and August 2009. INTERVENTION: Forty-one participants were assigned to the nonexercise control group, 73 to resistance training 3 days a week, 72 to aerobic exercise in which they expended 12 kcal/kg per week; and 76 to combined aerobic and resistance training in which they expended 10 kcal/kg per week and engaged in resistance training twice a week. Main Outcome Change in HbA(1c) level. Secondary outcomes included measures of anthropometry and fitness. RESULTS: The study included 63.0% women and 47.3% nonwhite participants who were a mean (SD) age of 55.8 years (8.7 years) with a baseline HbA(1c) level of 7.7% (1.0%). Compared with the control group, the absolute mean change in HbA(1c) in the combination training exercise group was -0.34% (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.64% to -0.03%; P = .03). The mean changes in HbA(1c) were not statistically significant in either the resistance training (-0.16%; 95% CI, -0.46% to 0.15%; P = .32) or the aerobic (-0.24%; 95% CI, -0.55% to 0.07%; P = .14) groups compared with the control group. Only the combination exercise group improved maximum oxygen consumption (mean, 1.0 mL/kg per min; 95% CI, 0.5-1.5, P < .05) compared with the control group. All exercise groups reduced waist circumference from -1.9 to -2.8 cm compared with the control group. The resistance training group lost a mean of -1.4 kg fat mass (95% CI, -2.0 to -0.7 kg; P < .05) and combination training group lost a mean of -1.7 (-2.3 to -1.1 kg; P < .05) compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, a combination of aerobic and resistance training compared with the nonexercise control group improved HbA(1c) levels. This was not achieved by aerobic or resistance training alone. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00458133.",nocancer
"Closing the gaps: the impact of inpatient detoxification and continuity of care on client outcomes. Inpatient detoxification is a critical element of the continuum of care for chemically dependent individuals, especially for those unable to establish sobriety on an outpatient basis. This study evaluated the impact of one such detoxification program on client outcomes during the year after detoxification. The program was a public/private partnership between Ventura County, California, and Tarzana Treatment Center in Los Angeles. Before admission, applicants agreed to enroll in treatment after detoxification. Clients were contacted at one month post-admission and quarterly thereafter for one year to collect data, corroborated by county records, on treatment and outcome variables. The sample included 117 consecutive admissions between July 2007 and June 2009. Detoxification completion rates and follow-up treatment enrollment rates were substantial: 85% of the sample completed detoxification; 71% enrolled in treatment afterward. Client outcomes were positive, particularly for those enrolled in followup treatment: compared to clients not completing detoxification, and to client functioning in the year before admission, sobriety and employment rates increased, and rates of homelessness, arrests and days incarcerated decreased. The study concludes that public investment in inpatient detoxification services and aftercare is an effective means to decrease both individual and societal costs of addiction.",nocancer
"Hormone therapy/adjuvant chemotherapy induced deleterious effects on the bone mass of breast cancer patients and the intervention of physiotherapy: a literature review. In recent years, breast cancer has witnessed some notable improvements regarding early diagnosis and new therapeutical strategies, mainly because of the utilization of new drugs and systemic treatment protocols, which have had a direct impact in the increase of these patients' global survival rate. At the same time, it is an ever-growing concern among oncology professionals to identify and minimize as much as possible the effects of long-term toxicity resulting from cancer therapies. Within this context, physiotherapy fits as a preventive and rehabilitating factor regarding functional and skeletal alterations, deriving not only from the direct action of breast cancer, but also from the treatment to which these patients are submitted. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to revise the scientific literature on possible adjuvant chemotherapy-induced secondary deleterious effects on the bone mass of patients diagnosed with breast cancer, and also to revise the literature on the intervention of physiotherapy in cases of secondary bone mass loss caused by adjuvant chemotherapy in patients suffering from breast cancer. METHODOLOGY: The research was carried out by consulting the following medical websites: Medicus Medline Index, Lilacs, Sciello, PubMed (National Library of Medicine), Google Academic and Capes (a Brazilian website for scientific information). The selection gathers articles written in different languages, English in special, published from January 1998 to October 2008. RESULTS: 24 studies explicitly mention chemotherapy-induced direct and/or indirect effects upon bone mass. Different authors refer to bone mass loss as one possible secondary deleterious effect resulting from adjuvant chemotherapy applied in breast cancer treatment. Nonetheless, no scientific articles were found on the subject of physiotherapy intervention aimed at patients in this specific condition. CONCLUSION: The results achieved in this revision study point out the possible chemotherapy-induced late deleterious effects on patients diagnosed with breast cancer, as well as the additional risks for the development of further osteoporotic conditions. Hormone therapy and adjuvant chemotherapy treatments may in fact augment and accelerate the loss of bone mass, be it directly, through the action of chemotherapeutical drugs, or indirectly, through the reduction of estrogenic levels and precocious menopause. The scarce material on the rehabilitation of bone mass loss deriving from adjuvant treatments reveals, as it seems, a strong need for new studies on the subject.",cancer
"Relations of familiarity with reasoning strategies in conspiracy beliefs. The prevalence and resilience of conspiracy beliefs suggest that such beliefs may derive in part from general information-processing mechanisms. Two predictions were tested: conspiracy beliefs would increase as familiarity with the conspiracy increased, and conspiracy beliefs would rest in part on the perception of the alleged conspirators' motive. Participants read condensed versions of four real-life conspiracy theories of varying familiarity, rated their belief in the conspiracies, and explained their ratings. Although belief was not associated with familiarity, participants used different justifications for their beliefs about familiar and unfamiliar conspiracies, relying prominently on motive when the conspiracy was unfamiliar. Preliminary data suggested that participants' beliefs in conspiracies may have been equally strong when they reasoned only in terms of motive as when they reasoned in terms of documented evidence. An additional finding suggested also that beliefs in conspiracies may increase as affiliation with the victim of the alleged conspiracy increases.",nocancer
"Evaluation of consistency in dosing directions and measuring devices for pediatric nonprescription liquid medications. CONTEXT: In response to reports of unintentional drug overdoses among children given over-the-counter (OTC) liquid medications, in November 2009 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released new voluntary industry guidelines that recommend greater consistency and clarity in OTC medication dosing directions and their accompanying measuring devices. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of inconsistent dosing directions and measuring devices among popular pediatric OTC medications at the time the FDA's guidance was released. DESIGN AND SETTING: Descriptive study of 200 top-selling pediatric oral liquid OTC medications during the 52 weeks ending October 30, 2009. Sample represents 99% of the US market of analgesic, cough/cold, allergy, and gastrointestinal OTC oral liquid products with dosing information for children younger than 12 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Inclusion of measuring device, within-product inconsistency between dosing directions on the bottle's label and dose markings on enclosed measuring device, across-product use of nonstandard units and abbreviations, and presence of abbreviation definitions. RESULTS: Measuring devices were packaged with 148 of 200 products (74.0%). Within this subset of 148 products, inconsistencies between the medication's dosing directions and markings on the device were found in 146 cases (98.6%). These included missing markings (n = 36, 24.3%) and superfluous markings (n = 120, 81.1%). Across all products, 11 (5.5%) used atypical units of measurement (eg, drams, cc) for doses listed. Milliliter, teaspoon, and tablespoon units were used for doses in 143 (71.5%), 155 (77.5%), and 37 (18.5%) products, respectively. A nonstandard abbreviation for milliliter (not mL) was used by 97 products. Of the products that included an abbreviation, 163 did not define at least 1 abbreviation. CONCLUSION: At the time the FDA released its new guidance, top-selling pediatric OTC liquid medications contained highly variable and inconsistent dosing directions and measuring devices.",nocancer
"Inhibition of GST-pi nuclear transfer increases mantle cell lymphoma sensitivity to cisplatin, cytarabine, gemcitabine, bortezomib and doxorubicin. PURPOSE: Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a chemoresistant lymphoma overexpressing the class pi glutathione-S-transferase (GST-pi). The nuclear localisation of GST-pi is induced by chemotherapy and is correlated to cell resistance. In this study, the effect of the Agaricus bisporus lectin (ABL), a GST-pi nuclear transfer inhibitor, on the chemosensitivity of MCL cells was investigated. METHODS: The proliferation of three MCL cell lines was evaluated in the presence of doxorubicin (DOX), cisplatin (CDDP), cytarabine (Ara-C), gemcitabine (GEM) or bortezomib with or without ABL pre-treatment. RESULTS: The cytotoxic activities of CDDP, Ara-C, GEM and bortezomib were increased in all cell lines. The DOX cytotoxic activity was enhanced in two of three cell lines. The inhibition of GST-pi nuclear transfer led to the potentialisation of all drug combinations. CONCLUSION: The inhibition of the nuclear transfer of GST-pi increases the MCL sensitivity to DOX, CDDP, Ara-C, GEM and bortezomib, alone or in combination.",cancer
"Carboplatin plus weekly paclitaxel treatment in non-small cell lung cancer patients with interstitial lung disease. BACKGROUND: Since advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with the interstitial lung disease (ILD) have been excluded from clinical trials, it is uncertain whether chemotherapy really provides a benefit to these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen advanced NSCLC patients with ILD that was detected on the chest X-rays were enrolled in this study. Carboplatin plus paclitaxel was administered by two methods (method A or method B). Method A: Carboplatin (AUC 6, day 1) and paclitaxel (70 mg/m(2), days 1, 8, 15) were administered every four weeks. Method B: Carboplatin (AUC 2, day 1, 8, 15) and paclitaxel (60 mg/m(2), days 1, 8, 15) were administered every four weeks. RESULTS: The response rate and the disease control rate were 33% and 53%. The median progression-free survival and the median overall survival time were 2.5 months and 7.0 months, respectively. The hematological toxicities were tolerable, but a grade 3 or higher pneumonitis was observed in 4 patients (27%). CONCLUSION: Carboplatin plus weekly paclitaxel must be administered carefully to advanced NSCLC patients with ILD that is detected on chest X-rays after a sufficient evaluation of the risks and the benefits.",cancer
"Wnt signaling and aging-related heart disorders. Aging is associated with various heart diseases, and this may be attributable, in part, to the prolonged exposure of the heart to cardiovascular risk factors. However, aging is also associated with heart disorders such as diastolic dysfunction that are not necessarily linked to the risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Recent studies have demonstrated a mechanistic link between Wnt signaling and premature aging or aging-related phenotypes. As a part of the review series on Wnt signaling and the cardiovascular system, we discuss here the possible involvement of Wnt signaling in aging-associated heart diseases or heart disorders.",nocancer
"Anti-CTLA-4 antibody adjuvant therapy in melanoma. Thus far the development of adjuvant therapies in melanoma has suffered greatly from the lack of effective drugs in stage IV melanoma. Chemotherapy, cytokines, vaccines, and combinations of drugs have been used with minimal success. This has led to adjuvant therapies that are not used uniformly or widely because of the rather marginal benefits, as no consistent and clinically significant impact on survival has been demonstrated. A new development for interferon-based adjuvant therapy seems to be the observation that better effects are observed in patients with lower tumor load and in patients with an ulcerated primary melanoma. A benefit for patients with more advanced lymphnodal involvement is quite unsure, clearly requiring new drugs to be explored. A new era in the treatment of melanoma treatment has arrived with the anti-cytoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (anti-CTLA-4) monoclonal antibodies. The randomized trial in advanced metastatic melanoma demonstrated a clear benefit with prolongation of survival. The anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody ipilimumab has finally changed the landscape. It is therefore only logical that a worldwide adjuvant trial with ipilimumab versus placebo, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 18071, is ongoing in patients with lymph node metastases, and that another adjuvant trial with ipilimumab compared to high-dose interferon (HDI) is planned in the United States. The EORTC 18071 trial will reach full accrual in 2011 and thus results are expected in 2013 or 2014.",cancer
"Immunochemical staining of MT2-MMP correlates positively to angiogenesis of human esophageal cancer. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play an important role in the pathological processes of degradation of extracellular matrix and destruction of basement membrane, which leads to tumor invasion and metastasis. In the present study, we investigated membrane-type 2 MMP (MT2-MMP) expression pattern in esophageal cancer tissues collected from 103 patients, and explored MT2-MMP expression pattern in correlation to patients' clinicopathological features, intratumoral angiogenesis and postoperative prognoses. The intensity of immunochemical staining of MT2-MMP was significantly positively correlated to the intratumoral angiogenesis of esophageal cancer tissues. Positive MT2-MMP immunoreactions were found in 85.4% of total tumor sections, whereas none or very weak MT2-MMP staining occurred in normal esophageal tissues. In addition, MT2-MMP immunochemical intensities were significantly correlated to tumor size, but not to patient's gender, age, invasion depth, lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis. Moreover, MT2-MMP levels could not be applied for predicting patients' survival rate although the H-score cut-off value showed the overall survival rate of patients with low MT2-MMP protein level to be better than those with high MT2-MMP protein level.",cancer

We describe a patient with extrahepatic portal venous obstruction due to a giant hepatic hemangioma associated with Kasabach-Merritt syndrome. A 67-year-old woman presented with upper abdominal distension and appetite loss. The medical history was not relevant to the current disorder. Initial laboratory tests revealed the following: serum platelet count, 9.9 x 10(4)/microL; serum fibrinogen degradation products, 12 microg/mL; prothrombin time, 1.26; and serum fibrinogen, 111 mg/dL. Computed tomography demonstrated homogenous low-density areas, 15 cm in diameter, in the left lobe of the liver. Common hepatic arteriography revealed a hypervascular tumor with pooling of contrast medium in the delayed phase. The portal venous phase of supramesenteric arteriography revealed obstruction and cavernous transformation of the portal vein. We diagnosed extrahepatic portal venous obstruction due to a giant hepatic hemangioma associated with Kasabach-Merritt syndrome. Laparotomy was performed, and the liver was found to be markedly enlarged. After mobilization of the left lobe, left hepatectomy was performed with intermittent clamping. After resection, Doppler ultrasonography revealed recovery of the portal venous flow. The cavernous transformation shrank. Pathologic examination of the surgical specimen confirmed the presence of a giant benign hepatic cavernous hemangioma. The patient was discharged 16 days after operation.

"Low-dose aspirin use and performance of immunochemical fecal occult blood tests. CONTEXT: Immunochemical fecal occult blood tests (iFOBTs) are potentially promising tools for colorectal cancer screening. Low-dose aspirin use, which increases the likelihood of gastrointestinal bleeding, is common in the target population for colorectal cancer screening. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of low-dose aspirin use with the performance of 2 quantitative iFOBTs in a large sample of patients undergoing colorectal cancer screening. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Diagnostic study conducted from 2005 through 2009 at internal medicine and gastroenterology practices in southern Germany including 1979 patients (mean age, 62.1 years): 233 regular users of low-dose aspirin (167 men, 67 women) and 1746 who never used low-dose aspirin (809 men, 937 women). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves in detecting advanced colorectal neoplasms (colorectal cancer or advanced adenoma) with 2 quantitative iFOBTs. RESULTS: Advanced neoplasms were found in 24 users (10.3%) and 181 nonusers (10.4%) of low-dose aspirin. At the cut point recommended by the manufacturer, sensitivities of the 2 tests were 70.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 48.9%-87.4%) for users compared with 35.9% (95% CI, 28.9%-43.4%) for nonusers and 58.3% (95% CI, 36.6%-77.9%) for users compared with 32.0% (95% CI, 25.3%-39.4%) for nonusers (P = .001 and P = .01, respectively). Specificities were 85.7% (95% CI, 80.2%-90.1%) for users compared with 89.2% (95% CI, 87.6%-90.7%) for nonusers and 85.7% (95% CI, 80.2%-90.1%) for users compared with 91.1% (95% CI, 89.5%-92.4%) for nonusers (P = .13 and P = .01, respectively). The areas under the ROC curve were 0.79 (95% CI, 0.68-0.90) for users compared with 0.67 (95% CI, 0.62-0.71) for nonusers and 0.73 (95% CI, 0.62-0.85) for users compared with 0.65 (95% CI, 0.61-0.69) for nonusers (P = .05 and P = .17, respectively). Among men, who composed the majority of low-dose aspirin users, the areas under the ROC curve were 0.87 (95% CI, 0.76-0.98) for users compared with 0.68 (95% CI, 0.63-0.74) for nonusers and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.68-0.93) for users compared with 0.67 (95% CI, 0.61-0.72) for nonusers (P = .003 and P = .04, respectively). CONCLUSION: For 2 iFOBTs, use of low-dose aspirin compared with no aspirin was associated with a markedly higher sensitivity for detecting advanced colorectal neoplasms, with only a slightly lower specificity.",cancer
"Quality differentials and reproductive health service utilisation determinants in India. PURPOSE: This paper seeks to establish relationships between women's reproductive health service use, assessed longitudinally and by facility type, with service quality perceptions related to public or private health facilities. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The study was mainly secondary and quantitative in nature. It included analysing data collected by the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS) and The Johns Hopkins University (JHU) as a follow-up study to the 1998-1999 National Family Health Survey (NFHS-2). The follow-up survey was carried out in Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Bihar and Jharkhand. In 2002-2003, these four states were selected to capture socio-economic and demographic variations. Analysis includes composite indices and logistic regression analysis. A scale was constructed to measure utilisation levels. Dimensions include: service proximity, doctor availability, waiting time, medicines, facility cleanliness, dignified treatment, privacy, service affordability and treatment effectiveness. FINDINGS: Findings indicate that doctor availability, waiting time, cleanliness, privacy and affordability at private health facilities enhance the probability that a health facility will be used for any reproductive health purpose. At the combined states level, medicine availability and treatment effectiveness at public health facilities enhances service use. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: The major limitation is that the study includes only selected Indian states. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The findings may enhance Indian service-quality policy.

Several commercial products are available with similar mechanisms of action and chemical structure. We report the use of Floseal in a laparotomy for ovarian cancer to achieve haemostasis. This is the first reported case with the successful use of Floseal in gynaecological oncology.,cancer
"Examination of the relations of the Myers-Briggs type indicator and the NEO-4 Personality Inventory in a Polish sample. The present study was designed to replicate McCrae and Costa's research findings on the relation of NEO-4 domains with the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator scales in a Polish sample of 300 psychology student volunteers (175 women, 125 men). Their mean age was 22.3 yr. (SD = 4.5). Correlations for scores on the MBTI scales with NEO-4 domains ranged from .72 to .02 for Extraversion, from -.60 to -.16 for Openness to experience, from -.56 to -.04 for Agreeableness, and from .55 to -.07 for Conscientiousness. Two domains assessed with the NEO-4 correspond to preferences measured by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator.",nocancer
"Longitudinal effects of social support and adaptive coping on the emotional well-being of survivors of localized prostate cancer. Survivors of prostate cancer experience treatment-related physical side effects that can compromise emotional well-being for years post-treatment. There is limited research investigating how social support and the use of coping may affect the emotional well-being of this population following treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate how social support and coping impact emotional well-being 2 years after treatment in survivors of localized prostate cancer who have received either radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy. Psychosocial and disease-specific measures were administered to an ethnically and demographically diverse sample of 180 men treated for localized prostate cancer at baseline and at 2-year follow-up. Regression analyses demonstrated that higher levels of social support at baseline predicted better emotional well-being 2 years later. Furthermore, higher levels of adaptive coping at baseline partially mediated the relationship between social support and emotional well-being. Supportive relationships may contribute to improved emotional well-being following treatment by facilitating the use of adaptive coping strategies. Attention should be given to strengthening social support networks and educating survivors of prostate cancer on adaptive coping techniques.",cancer
"Mucoepidermoid carcinoma of a nasal cavity--a rare tumour. BACKGROUNDS: Mucoepidermoid tumours arise from the ductal cells of the salivary glands, most commonly the parotid. The occurrence of these tumours in the mucus glands of the air passages is extremely rare. They are very aggressive tumours with poor prognosis. CASE: A case of nasal mucoepidermoid carcinoma with probable origin from the middle turbinate is reported. CONCLUSION: Nasal mucoepidermoid carcinomas are extremely rare. They usually present with symptoms similar to sinusitis. When dealing with a recurrent/aggressive tumour in the ethmoids, the possibility of mucoepidermoid carcinoma can be considered in the differential diagnosis. They are aggressive tumours with a poor prognosis.",cancer
"Pyoderma gangrenosum. Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is an idiopathic, ulcerative, noninfective chronic inflammatory skin disorder of unknown etiology. It is associated with systemic medical illness in 50% of cases like inflammatory bowel disease, systemic arthritis, haematological diseases and malignancies. Characteristic lesions begin as pustule or vesiculopustule and progresses to an ulcer or deep erosion with violaceous overhanging or undermined borders. Diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum is clinical and depends on exclusion of other causes of cutaneous ulceration. The management of PG is treatment of underlying systemic medical illness and judicious use of immunosuppressants. Association of PG with these medical illnesses and treatment with immunosuppressants make the clinical utility for internists, gastroenterologists, haematologists and rheumatologists.",nocancer
"Vascular basis for brain degeneration: faltering controls and risk factors for dementia. The integrity of the vascular system is essential for the efficient functioning of the brain. Aging-related structural and functional disturbances in the macro- or microcirculation of the brain make it vulnerable to cognitive dysfunction, leading to brain degeneration and dementing illness. Several faltering controls, including impairment in autoregulation, neurovascular coupling, blood-brain barrier leakage, decreased cerebrospinal fluid, and reduced vascular tone, appear to be responsible for varying degrees of neurodegeneration in old age. There is ample evidence to indicate vascular risk factors are also linked to neurodegenerative processes preceding cognitive decline and dementia. The strongest risk factor for brain degeneration, whether it results from vascular or neurodegenerative mechanisms or both, is age. However, several modifiable risks such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and obesity enhance the rate of cognitive decline and increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease in particular. The ultimate accumulation of brain pathological lesions may be modified by genetic influences, such as the apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele and the environment. Lifestyle measures that maintain or improve cardiovascular health, including consumption of healthy diets, moderate use of alcohol, and implementation of regular physical exercise are important factors for brain protection.",nocancer
"Migrating shrapnel: a rare cause of knee synovitis. Shrapnel injuries in soft tissues often do not require surgical excision. Metals that remain embedded in the surrounding tissue are not thought to cause significant damage and the patients are generally asymptomatic. This case presentation describes a patient who sustained a penetrating shrapnel injury to his thigh, where the metal fragment was not removed. However, more than 20 years later, the patient developed knee synovitis. On X-ray the shrapnel was seen in the suprapatellar pouch. An arthroscopy was preformed and the shrapnel was removed with full healing of the patient. Conclusion: although nonsurgical treatment of shrapnel in soft tissues is the treatment of choice in many cases, late migration is possible, causing distal symptoms and may require surgical excision.",nocancer
"New system for multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis of the enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli strains belonging to three major serogroups: O157, O26, and O111. Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), a food- and waterborne pathogen, causes diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, and life-threatening HUS. MLVA is a newly developed and widely accepted genotyping tool. An MLVA system for EHEC O157 involving nine genomic loci has already been established. However, the present study revealed that the above-mentioned MLVA system cannot analyze EHEC O26 and O111 isolates-the second and third most dominant EHEC serogroups in Japan, respectively. Therefore, with several modifications to the O157 system and the use of nine additional loci, we developed an expanded MLVA system applicable to EHEC O26, O111, and O157. Our MLVA system had a relatively high resolution power for each of the three serogroups: Simpson's index of diversity was 0.991 (95% CI = 0.989-0.993), 0.988 (95% CI, 0.986-0.990), and 0.986 (95% CI, 0.979-0.993) for O26, O111, and O157, respectively. This system also detected outbreak-related isolates; the isolates collected during each of the 12 O26 and O111 outbreaks formed unique clusters, and most of the repeat copy numbers among the isolates collected during the same outbreak exhibited no or single-locus variations. These results were comparable to those of cluster analyses based on PFGE profiles. Therefore, our system can complement PFGE analysis-the current golden method. Because EHEC strains of three major serogroups can be rapidly analyzed on a single platform with our expanded MLVA system, this system could be widely used in molecular epidemiological studies of EHEC infections.",nocancer
"""Circadian cortical compensation"": a longitudinal study of brain function during technical and cognitive skills in acutely sleep-deprived surgical residents. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that fatigue-induced performance decline in surgical residents is associated with changes in brain function as detected by functional near-infrared spectroscopy. METHODS: Surgical residents (n = 7) participated in a prospective study involving 2-hourly objective measurements of neurocognitive skill (arithmetic calculations using Nintendo ""brain training""), technical performance (surgical knot tying on a trainer, and monitoring time taken, path length and number of movements), and introspective fatigue (questionnaire-based) across 10 hours of acute sleep deprivation (10:00 PM to 8:00 PM. Simultaneously, changes in cortical oxyhemoglobin (HbO(2)), deoxyhemoglobin (HHb), and total hemoglobin (HbT), inferring prefrontal function, were recorded by using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. RESULTS: Arithmetic performance remained stable despite increasing levels of subject fatigue (time: P = 0.07, errors: P = 0.70, efficiency: P = 0.58). Technical skill improved between the first (10:00 PM and the second (12:00 AM sessions (P < 0.05) and stabilized thereafter (12:00 AM to 8:00 AM. Greater activation was required to complete cognitive versus technical drills. Stimulus type (0: cognitive, 1: technical) was found to be an independent predictor of changes in cortical excitation (HbO(2): P < 0.01, HHb: P < 0.05, HbT: P < 0.01). Cortical responses to the cognitive task increased over the course of the simulated night shift. In addition, ""time interval"" was observed to be an independent predictor of cortical hemodynamic change (HbO(2): P < 0.01, HbT: P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Neurocognitive tasks may tax the sleep-deprived resident more than well-learned technical skills. Performing cognitive skills at night, such as decision making, may depend upon enhanced prefrontal recruitment indicative of a focused attentional strategy and/or compensation to sleep deprivation. Further work should focus on determining whether errors in performance are associated with attentional lapses and failure of cortical compensation.",nocancer
"Therapeutic molecular targets in human chondrosarcoma. Chondrosarcomas are malignant cartilage tumours. They are poorly responsive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Treatment is usually limited to surgical resection; however, survival of patients with high-grade chondrosarcoma is poor, even with wide surgical resection. Induction of apoptosis in chondrosarcoma cells, either directly or by enhancement of the response to chemotherapeutic drugs and radiation, may be a route by which outcome can be improved. In this article, we review potential molecular targets that regulate chondrocyte apoptosis and discuss the experimental evidence for their utility.",cancer
"Tularemia outbreak associated with outdoor exposure along the western side of Utah Lake, Utah, 2007. OBJECTIVES: In 2007, a localized outbreak of tularemia occurred among visitors to a lodge on the western side of Utah Lake, Utah. We assessed risk factors for disease and attempted to identify undiagnosed clinically compatible illnesses. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study by recruiting all people who had visited the lodge on the western side of Utah Lake from June 3 to July 28, 2007. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to a sub-cohort of people who were part of an organized group that had at least one tularemia patient. Questions assessed risk and protective factors and disease symptoms. RESULTS: During the outbreak period, 14 cases of tularemia were reported from five of Utah's 12 health districts. The weekly attack rate ranged from 0 to 2.1/100 lodge visitors from June 3 to July 28. Illness onset dates ranged from June 15 to July 8. The median delay between onset of symptoms and laboratory test for tularemia was 14 days (range: 7-34 days). Cohort study respondents who reported deer-fly bites while at the lodge (adjusted risk ratio [ARR] = 7.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.4, 22.0) and who reported having worn a hat (ARR = 5.6, 95% CI 1.3, 24.6) were more likely to become ill. CONCLUSIONS: This was Utah's second documented deer-fly-associated human tularemia outbreak. People participating in outdoor activities in endemic areas should be aware of disease risks and take precautions. Educational campaigns can aid in earlier disease recognition, reporting, and, consequently, outbreak detection.",nocancer
Granulomatous mycosis fungoides with large cell transformation misdiagnosed as leprosy. BACKGROUND: Granulomatous mycosis fungoides is an unusual histopathological variant of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma without clinical distinction from classic mycosis fungoides. Symptoms associated with peripheral nerve involvement have rarely been reported in the literature. CASE REPORT: The authors described a case of granulomatous MF stage IIB with large cell transformation who initially presented with leprosy-like condition and chronic left peroneal neuropathy The patient received six courses ofgemcitabine with greater than 90% improvement of skin lesions. The rest of the lesions were successfully treated with local electron beam radiation. CONCLUSION: Granulomatous MF with neuropathy can be clinically misdiagnosed if there is no histopathological and immunohistochemical finding to support the diagnosis of lymphoma.,cancer
"Prognostic value of IL-6 in localized prostatic cancer. AIM: The usefulness of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and its soluble receptor IL-6sR in the prediction of the biochemical recurrence was evaluated in patients with prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: IL-6 and sIL-6R serum levels were measured in 96 patients with prostate cancer. RESULTS: Using the log-rank test, it was evident that patients with preoperative serum levels of IL-6 higher than 1.2 pg/ml had a significantly increased probability of biochemical recurrence (p=0.031). We also observed that the Gleason score was associated with the risk of progression (p=0.033), but no relation was observed with TNM classification, PSA, % free PSA or sIL-6R. In a multivariate analysis, only IL-6 serum levels remained as a predictor of biochemical recurrence (p=0.040). CONCLUSION: The results presented here demonstrated the usefulness of IL-6 in predicting the biochemical progression of prostate cancer, pointing towards an association between inflammation and the aggressiveness of the tumor.",cancer

"Cytomorphology, ultrastructural, and cytogenetic findings in follicular dendritic cell sarcoma: a case report. BACKGROUND: Follicular dendritic cell (FDC) sarcoma is a rare low-to-intermediate grade malignant dendritic cell neoplasm that often has an indolent clinical course. FDC sarcomas are often misdiagnosed on aspiration cytology. CASE: A 26-year-old woman presented with a solid, slowly growing, painless mass in her right neck for 3 months. Computed tomography revealed a 3.6-cm, well-defined homogenous solid mass located posterior to the mandible and submandibular glands. Fine needle aspiration cytology revealed many large, spindle to ovoid epithelioid cells in singles, small clusters, and syncytial sheets with moderate to abundant cytoplasm, indistinct cell borders, irregular nuclear membrane, fine to vesicular chromatin, and conspicuous nucleoli. The background contained many small mature lymphocytes intimately mixed with large epithelioid tumor cells. Tumor cells were strongly positive for CD21, CD35, CD23, and fascin. Diagnosis of FDC sarcoma was rendered; follow-up surgical resection and ultrastructural study confirmed the diagnosis. The cytogenetic study showed a normal female karyotype 46,XX. CONCLUSION: Although the cytomorphology of FDC sarcoma is characteristic, a preoperative diagnosis of FDC sarcoma based on fine needle aspiration cytology is very challenging, if not impossible. Immunohistochemistry is always necessary for rendering and/or confirming the diagnosis, and ultrastructural studies are helpful.",cancer
"On getting there from here. Studies on a variety of interesting biological problems, ranging from circadian rhythm to cancer cell growth to longevity, have begun to give evidence that the physiological state of cells and tissues reflects both the cell's regulatory systems and its state of intermediary metabolism. It is appreciated that the regulatory state of a cell or tissue, as driven by transcription factors and signaling pathways, can impose itself upon the dynamics of metabolic state. It follows that the reciprocal must also be the case, that metabolic state will feed back to impose itself on regulatory state. An appreciation and understanding of this reciprocity may be required to crack open problems in biological research that have heretofore been insoluble.",cancer
"Impact of tumor viability at second-look procedures performed before completing treatment on the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study Group protocol IRS-IV, 1991-1997: a report from the children's oncology group. PURPOSES: The aims of the study were to compare results of clinical/radiographic studies before second-look procedures (SLP) with SLP specimens from patients with gross residual sarcoma at diagnosis and to relate tumor viability to outcome. PATIENTS: Seventy-three patients underwent SLP before completing chemotherapy, with (n = 59) or without (n = 14) radiotherapy. Tumor sites were bladder/prostate (n = 27), head/orbit/parameningeal (n = 22), extremity/trunk (n = 14), and retroperitoneum/pelvis (n = 10). RESULTS: Of 14 patients, 1 (7%) with clinical/radiographic complete response (CR) had viable tumor. Of 59 patients, 35 (59%) without CR had viable tumor. Five-year failure-free survival (FFS) rates were 81% in 37 patients without viable tumor and 53% in 36 patients with viable tumor (Cox proportional hazards adjusted P = .05). Five-year FFS rates were 67% in 15 patients with clear margins and 43% in 21 patients with tumor-involved margins (n = 18) or viable gross tumor (n = 3) (Cox proportional hazards adjusted P = .04). Five-year survival was 78% to 79% among 73 patients with and 333 patients without SLP during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Second-look procedures can show whether viable tumor is present and may be beneficial in selected patients with rhabdomyosarcoma. Disappearance of tumor (CR) usually correlated with no viable tumor at SLP. However, 41% of patients without CR had no viable tumor. Those without viable tumor had increased FFS but not survival compared to those with viable tumor.",cancer
"Antioxidative effects of thiazide diuretics in refractory hypertensive patients. A randomized crossover trial of chlortalidone and trichlormethiazide. Some thiazide diuretics seem to exert antioxidant effects, which may be beneficial in the management of hypertension. Although many large-scale clinical trials on hypertension have proved that thiazide diuretics confer significant reductions in stroke and cardiovascular events, most of these trials preferentially used chlortalidone. Therefore, the difference in antioxidant effects between chlortalidone (CAS 77-36-1; 12.5 mg/day) and another thiazide diuretic, trichlormethiazide (CAS 133-67-5; 1 mg/day) was studied. Forty patients with refractory hypertension even after treatment with a combination of a calcium channel blocker and an angiotensin II receptor blocker were randomly assigned to additionally receive either chlortalidone or trichlormethiazide for 6 months. Then, diuretics were switched in each patient and they were treated for another 6 months. Ambulatory blood pressure was monitored for 24 h and markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein) and oxidative stress (8-isoprostane, malondialdehyde-modified low-density lipoproteins) were measured before and after each treatment. Addition of chlortalidone resulted in a greater reduction of blood pressure (mean of 24 h; from 146.8 +/- 18.0/83.8 +/- 12.2 mmHg to 122 +/- 18/72 +/- 11 mmHg) than that of trichlormethiazide (134 +/- 18/ 78 +/- 11 mmHg, p < 0.001). The levels of C-reactive protein, malondialdehyde-modified low-density lipoproteins, and 8-isoprostane were lower after chlortalidone therapy than after trichlormethiazide therapy. These results suggest that chlortalidone is superior to trichlormethiazide in patients with essential hypertension.",nocancer
"Neuroanatomic basis of amnestic MCI differs in patients with and without Parkinson disease. OBJECTIVE: To explore the neuroanatomic basis of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) in patients with Parkinson disease (PD; aMCI-PD(+)) and without PD (aMCI-PD(-)). METHODS: A total of 119 patients with aMCI (aMCI-PD(-), n = 78, and aMCI-PD(+), n = 41) underwent T1-weighted MRI, and the image data were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry. RESULTS: No significant differences in demographic characteristics or general cognition were found between patients with aMCI-PD(-) and aMCI-PD(+). Comparisons of neuropsychological tests between groups revealed that patients with aMCI-PD(-) had lower scores in delayed verbal and visual recognition memory, whereas visuospatial dysfunction was more severe in patients with aMCI-PD(+). Gray matter (GM) density in the right temporal and posterior cingular cortices was significantly lower in the aMCI-PD(-) group compared with controls. In contrast, GM density in the aMCI-PD(+) group was significantly lower in the precuneus and left prefrontal and primary motor areas relative to controls. A direct comparison between groups showed that decreased GM density in aMCI-PD(-) relative to aMCI-PD(+) was localized in the right temporal and anterior prefrontal areas, whereas decreased GM density in aMCI-PD(+) relative to aMCI-PD(-) was involved in the bilateral precuneus, left primary motor, and right parietal areas. Memory decline was correlated with temporal area atrophy in aMCI-PD(-) and with posterior cingulate cortex atrophy in aMCI-PD(+). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that different neuroanatomic systems underlie memory dysfunction in patients with aMCI-PD(-) and aMCI-PD(+).",nocancer
"""Cellular swirls"" and similar structures on fine needle aspiration cytology as diagnostic clues to papillary thyroid carcinoma: a report of 4 cases. BACKGROUND: ""Cellular swirls"" are one of the recently recognized criteria for diagnosing papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Following its initial description, no publications have appeared in the literature. CASE: Thyroid aspirates from 4 adult patients, 3 with a clinical diagnosis of PTC and 1 diagnosed as nodular goiter were studied. Cytologically, all 4 cases showed classic features of PTC. In addition to the characteristic cytomorphology of PTC, all 4 cases showed cellular swirls, which are a newly recognized diagnostic criterion of PTC. Also seen were structures that partially resembled cellular swirls. These latter structures were found to be more prominent in the aspiration smears than the characteristic swirls and, therefore, we strongly think that even the partical swirls with contiguous cellular sheets exhibiting similar nuclear morphology are also useful in prompting a search for ""complete swirls"" that are thought to be specific for PTC. CONCLUSION: Cellular swirls and similar structures seen on fine needle aspiration cytologic smears can serve as useful features in the diagnosis of PTC.",cancer
"TRAIL-expressing mesenchymal stem cells kill the putative cancer stem cell population. BACKGROUND: Tumours contain stem-like, side population (SP) cells, which have increased tumorigenic potential, resistance to traditional therapies and may be responsible for treatment failures and relapse in patients. METHODS: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were engineered to express the apoptotic ligand, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Squamous (H357) and lung (A549) cancer cell lines were sorted into side and non-side populations (non-SP) by Hoechst flow cytometry. The survival and growth of both SP and non-SP cancer populations, in conjunction with TRAIL-expressing MSCs and mitoxantrone chemotherapy, were assessed by flow cytometry and colony forming ability. RESULTS: Mesenchymal stem cells expressing TRAIL migrate to tumours and reduce the growth of primary cancers and metastases. This report demonstrates that these cells cause apoptosis, death and reduced colony formation of the SP of squamous and adenocarcinoma lung cancer cells and are synergistic when combined with traditional chemotherapy in apoptosis induction. CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity of putative cancer stem cells to TRAIL-expressing MSCs, suggests their possible role in the prevention of cancer relapse.",cancer

"Analysis of real-time PCR cycle threshold of alpha-thalassemia-1 Southeast Asian type deletion using fetal cell-free DNA in maternal plasma for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of Bart's hydrops fetalis. BACKGROUND: Noninvasive prenatal diagnosis based on detection of fetal cell-free DNA is hampered when mother and father are both carriers for the same autosomal recessive mutation. OBJECTIVE: To compare the diagnosis of Bart's hydrops fetalis using conventional Gap-PCR analysis of fetal cells/tissues with the measurement of quantitative difference (deltaCp) between alpha-thalassemia-1 SEA type deletion gene (C(T-mutant)) and wild type alpha-globin gene (C(T-wild type)) in plasma of pregnancies by using the Taqman real-time quantitative PCR. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Plasma DNA samples were collected from three groups of pregnancies whose fetuses have known thalasemia status (7 normal, 11 heterozygote alpha-thalassemia-1 SEA type deletion, and 7 Bart's hydrops fetalis). The alpha-thalassemia-1 SEA type deletion gene and wild type alpha-globin gene were quantified by using Taqman real-time quantitative PCR and then the delta C(T) was analyzed by subtracting the C(T-mutant) from C(T-wild type). RESULTS: Mean deltaC(T) values were not significantly different among the three groups. However, women whose fetuses were diagnosed as Bart's hydrops fetalis had a higher proportion (43%) of plasma DNA samples that had negative deltaC(T) value than women whose fetuses were diagnosed as normal or heterozygote alpha-thalassemia-1 SEA type deletion (0 and 27%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Further investigations are needed to improve the diagnosis of Bart's hydrops fetalis using fetal cell-free DNA.",nocancer
"Nasal dermoids without intracranial extension in teenagers. BACKGROUND: Nasal dermoid cysts are benign, cystic midline masses. They contain mature tissues and often pocket hair, fat or sebum. Patients usually present with nasal enlargement or with a wide nasal dorsum with or without a fistula, causing an unacceptable cosmetic appearance. OBJECTIVE: To define a reliable surgical approach and method of removing dermoid with no intracranial extension in adolescent age. METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively present diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in three teenagers ages 15, 17 and 18. All patients underwent prior surgeries at different hospitals. In the first case, the incision and exstirpation of the fistula's opening, followed by the fistula's canal, was performed. In the other two patients, the nasal dermoids were removed via the open approach with the transcollumelar incision. In all patients, we performed rhinoplasty with osteotomies to achieve an improved cosmetic effect. The esthetic results are presented. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of nasal swelling requires imaging. Total excision of the cyst is considered the casual treatment. The open rhinoplasty is an adequate method in patients with nasal dermoids without an intracranial extension. Experienced surgeons should manage the functional and esthetical aspects together during the same surgery.",cancer
"The severity of neural invasion is a crucial prognostic factor in rectal cancer independent of neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy. OBJECTIVE: To provide a comprehensive characterization of neural invasion (NI) in rectal adenocarcinoma (RC), to establish a novel NI-severity scoring system, and to assess the prognostic value of NI with emphasis on its localization and severity. BACKGROUND: The literature merely contains small-scale studies with limited histopathological characterization of NI in RC. METHODS: Neural invasion was thoroughly characterized in 296 patients with locally advanced uT3-RC (139 with primary resection and 157 with neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy [nRCTx]). To identify the precise localization of NI, we investigated the main tumor, peritumoral area, adjacent normal tissue, and all lymph nodes. To classify the clinical impact of NI, an NI severity score was established and related to patient prognosis. RESULTS: Neural invasion was detected in 32% of patients with primary resection and in 19% (P = 0.010) receiving nRCTx. The major location of NI was found in the peritumoral area. The prevalence of NI in the main tumor within the primary resection group was 6%, whereas it was absent in the nRCTx group (P = 0.002). Increasing NI severity, but not NI localization, was associated with a significantly poorer survival and increased local recurrence rate in both groups. Multivariate analysis (including TNM-stage, grading, and Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)) revealed NI prevalence and severity as independent prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: Neural invasion in RC has a heterogeneous appearance in regard to its localization and its severity. nRCTx seems to have a suppressive effect on NI. Neural invasion severity might be applied as a novel tool to estimate accurately patient's prognosis and thus should be considered in pathology reports.",cancer
"Pathologic evidence that the T188R mutation in PRNP is associated with prion disease. Human prion diseases can be caused by mutations in the prion protein gene PRNP. Prion disease with mutations at codon 188 has been reported in 6 cases, but only 1 had the T188R mutation and it was not pathologically confirmed. We report the clinical, neuropsychologic, imaging, genetic, and neuropathologic features of a patient with familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, associated with a very rare PRNP mutation at T188R. The patient presented with prominent behavioral changes in addition to the more typical cognitive and motorimpairments seen in sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The autopsy confirmed prion disease pathology. This case supports the pathogenicity of the T188 PRNP mutation, demonstrates the variability of clinical phenotypes associated with certain mutations, and emphasizes the importance of testing for genetic prion disease in cases of apparently sporadic atypical dementia.",nocancer

Such modeling is important on every level in teacher education programs, particularly special education programs. The higher a student's level (i.e., undergraduate vs. doctoral), the more notice that student will take of disparities between rhetoric and actions. While reflective practices are explicitly taught in teacher preparation programs to enable professionals to reflect on their own personal and professional practices, teacher education faculty need to employ the same strategy to ensure that they are indeed modeling the practices they teach. This position paper documents the impressions of a doctoral cohort in special education in terms of inclusionary practices demonstrated in a real-life context.",nocancer

Ovarian cancer remains an ongoing challenge because of the occurrence of resistant forms of tumour for which the drugs fail to function. Combination therapy using drugs with different mechanisms of action offer a means of overcoming drug resistance and reducing the side-effects. In this study, binary combinations of four platinum compounds cisplatin (Cs), oxaliplatin (Ox), YH12 [trans-PtCl(2)(ammino) {imidazo-(1,2-alpha)pyridine}] and TH1 [{trans-PtCl(NH(3))(2)}(2) {trans-Pt(3-hydroxypyridine)(2)(H(2)N(CH(2)) 6NH(2))(2)}Cl(4)] and two plant-based mitotic inhibitors paclitaxel (Tx) and colchicine (Co) have been used against ovarian cancer cell lines A2780 and A2780(cisR) using five different sequences of addition: 0/0 h, 4/0 h, 0/4 h, 24/0 h and 0/24 h. The strongest synergistic effect was observed when the plant compound (Tx or Co) was added first followed by platinum four hours later with combination index at 50% effect level (fa= 0.5) ranging from 0.03 to 0.36 and 0.10 to 0.72 in A2780 and A2780(cisR) cells respectively. Of all the platinum compounds, Cs showed the greatest synergism when combined with Tx and Co (combination index, CI(50)=0.03 in A2780 and from 0.10 to 0.12 in A2780(cisR)). With the sequence 24/0 h, platinum compounds showed greater synergistic effect with Co than Tx in A2780(cisR). With the sequences 0/4 h and 0/24 h, most of the combinations showed weak synergism to antagonism, especially in A2780(cisR). Antagonism was also observed when the two compounds were added simultaneously, especially in A2780(cisR). CONCLUSION: Binary combinations of platinum compounds Cs, Ox, YH12 and TH1 with plant compounds Tx and Co applied to ovarian cancer cell lines showed sequence- and concentration-dependent synergism. The results may have profound implications in therapy, if found to be true in vivo.",cancer
"Cytologic findings in malignant ependymoma: a case report. BACKGROUND: Intraoperative imprint cytology has proved to be a valuable tool in the diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) tumors. Ependymomas are uncommon glial neoplasms of the CNS, arising from ependymal lining of the ventricular system and central canal of the spinal cord. Anaplastic ependymoma is a rare tumor that causes diagnostic difficulties in imprint cytology because of variable cytomorphologic findings. CASE: A 21-year-old girl presented with a history of headache and vomiting. Computed tomography of the head showed hydrocephalus with a large parietal lobe tumor with midline structural shift. Imprint intraoperative cytology revealed a hypercellular smear composed of multiple clusters of small size cells with scant amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm with high nucleus to cytoplasm ratios. The tumor showed pseudorosettes with glial fibrillary acidic protein and epithelial membrane antigen expression. The diagnosis was made with histologic and immunologic confirmation. CONCLUSION: Although imprint cytology is a useful method for making a rapid diagnosis, but immunohistochemical markers play a major role in the final diagnosis.",cancer
"SLC34A2 as a novel marker for diagnosis and targeted therapy of breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to estimate the role of the SLC34A2 gene in breast cancer. A total of 146 samples were collected from breast cancer tissues and their adjacent normal breast tissues. Reverse transcription and real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to estimate gene expression levels. There was a significantly increased gene expression of SLC34A2 (normal tissues: 6.71+/-0.77; tumour tissues: 10.29+/-0.80) among breast cancer tissues compared with normal tissues. However, there was no significant association between overall survival and the gene expression level of SLC34A2. Moreover, a significant overexpression of CA125 (normal tissues: 7.26+/-0.62; tumour tissues: 10.51+/-0.58) in breast cancer tissues and a significant correlation between SLC34A2 and CA125 gene expressions were found. Our results suggested SLC34A2 to be involved in the development of breast cancer; this gene may therefore be a novel marker for the detection of breast cancer and act as a target gene in therapeutic strategies.",cancer
"Minimizing reperfusion injuries: successful resuscitation using eCPR after cardiac arrest on a post-operative Norwood patient. In patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), the left ventricle is too small to circulate adequate oxygenated blood. If left untreated, HLHS is fatal.A 3-staged palliative procedure ultimately leading to a single ventricle physiology is the preferred management strategy for HLHS in most pediatric cardiac centers in the United States. In this report, a 1-month-old infant developed cardiac arrest 3 weeks after undergoing a Norwood procedure as an initial palliation for HLHS. After 151 minutes of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with intermittent, but non-sustainable return of spontaneous circulation, extracorporeal cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (eCPR) was used. Utilizing the carotid artery and internal jugular vein for cannulation, we connected our extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) circuit to the patient. To minimize reperfusion injury, immediate cooling, arterial/venous shunting, minimal calcium, and hemodilution strategies were used. Once paCO2/pvCO2 gradients were minimized, we instituted sweep gas and gradually increased fiO2 as pH normalized. The patient was successfully weaned from ECMO and discharged, eCPR was used successfully in the resuscitation of this patient and reperfusion injuries were minimized despite prolonged CPR.",nocancer
"Morphologic and body composition changes are different in men and women on generic combination antiretroviral therapy--an observational study. BACKGROUND: Increasingly effective therapies for HIV infection, combination antiretroviral therapy, are now widely available in developing countries. A range of metabolic complications presenting as abnormalities of body-fat mass distribution in association with dyslipidemia and glucose homeostasis dysregulation, have been recognized as important toxicities in patients treated with these drugs. With increasing use of antiretroviral therapy in India, we examined the association between gender and body shape and composition, one year after initiating combination antiretroviral therapy and attempted to identify simple clinical markers to detect and monitor these changes. METHODS: Patients on combination antiretroviral therapy (2 NRTIs + 1 NNRTI), attending a HIV clinic between July 2005 and December 2006 had anthropometry clinical examination and bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA) performed along with blood tests at baseline and after 1 year. RESULTS: Of the 34 patients on combination antiretroviral therapy, 5 males and 12 females had noticeable changes in their body shape. Significant decrease in triceps skin fold thickness, an increase in waist circumference and waist: hip ratio was observed in females. BIA did not show any change in total body fat in either sex. CONCLUSIONS: Since the presence and severity of fat redistribution could affect adherence as well as the success of antiretroviral therapy, close monitoring is required to detect and prevent this complication early.",nocancer
"Volume measurement of liver metastases using multidetector computed tomography: comparison of lesion diameter and volume segmentation - a phantom study. PURPOSE: To compare lesion volume determination by applying diameter measurement and three different segmentation algorithms at different slice thicknesses reconstructed from computed tomography (CT) of a phantom model for hepatic colorectal metastases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on CT attenuation measurements obtained retrospectively from 20 patients with colorectal liver metastases, a phantom model was designed with a sponge soaked with a dilution of contrast agent and 6 embedded polyamide spheres (diameter, 8 - 30 mm) to simulate the contrast behavior of liver metastases. CT scans were obtained and reconstructed at different slice thicknesses (0.625/1.25/2.5/3.75 mm; increment, 1). One observer performed software-aided volume determination using the maximum diameter, manual segmentation, seed point method, and threshold method six times for each lesion in a randomized order. Statistical analysis revealed the absolute and relative differences from the actual lesion volumes and the intraobserver differences as well as the influence of slice thickness for each method. RESULTS: The mean relative differences of the seed point method (1.2 - 5.9%) and manual segmentation (2.6 - 4.9%) were significantly lower than the threshold method (5.4 - 12.8%) and diameter measurement (12.3 - 18.5%; p < 0.01). Volume determination by manual segmentation and the seed point method benefited from the use of thin-slice CT datasets. The intraobserver variation was lowest when using the manual segmentation (1.5 - 3.3%) and the seed point method (2.2 - 3.9%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Manual segmentation and the seed point method for thin CT slices were the methods with the lowest volume differences and intraobserver variation.",cancer
"Well-differentiated papillary mesothelioma in association with endometrial carcinoma: a case report. BACKGROUND: Well-differentiated papillary mesothelioma (WDPM) is an uncommon tumor usually arising in the peritoneum and mostly an incidental finding during abdominal and pelvic surgery. Its natural history and association with other neoplasms is not clearly understood. We present a rare case of WDPM in association with high-grade endometrial carcinoma. To our knowledge, there are only two previously reported cases in the English literature of WDPM in association with endometrial carcinoma. CASE: A 62-year-old woman underwent pelvic surgery for a high-grade endometrial adenocarcinoma. At laparotomy an extensive peritoneal nodular fibrotic reaction was present, raising the clinical possibility of metastatic disease; however, intraoperative frozen section reported this as a mesothelial reaction. Cytologic examination of peritoneal washings revealed cohesive clusters of reactive-appearing mesothelial cells, some with papillary morphology, and no evidence of adenocarcinoma. The peritoneal biopsies showed no metastatic carcinoma. The endometrial tumor was an endometrioid adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSION: The cytologic diagnosis of WDPM may be difficult because it is an uncommon entity and there are overlapping features with other neoplastic and nonneoplastic lesions of the female genital tract and peritoneum. Compounding this, WDPM may occur in association with other neoplasms. We highlight the potential for surgical and pathologic misinterpretation of this entity.",cancer
"Comparative aspects of in vitro proliferation of human and porcine lymphocytes exposed to mycotoxins. Mycotoxins are fungal secondary metabolites that elicit a wide spectrum of toxicological effects, including the alteration of normal immune function. In the present study we investigated the independent effect of four mycotoxins, aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), fumonisin B1 (FB1), deoxynivalenol (DON) and nivalenol (NIV), on lymphocyte proliferation using human and porcine lymphocytes. Human and porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells and porcine splenocytes were cultured with increasing concentrations of mycotoxins for 72 hours and labelled in the last 24 hours with [methyl-3H]-thymidine. The results showed that increased concentrations of AFB1, DON and NIV affected the [methyl-3H]-thymidine cellular proliferation following mitogen stimulation in both species and cell types. Lower concentrations of mycotoxins enhanced cellular proliferation, which was more pronounced in human than in porcine cells, while higher concentrations caused a dose-dependent decrease. DON and NIV were the most potent mycotoxin in both species and both cell types. Based on the results of this in vitro study, high correlations were found between proliferation of human and porcine lymphocytes after mycotoxin exposure, especially for DON and NIV.",nocancer
"Biomedical activities of endohedral metallofullerene optimized for nanopharmaceutics. Endohedral metallofullerenes, a novel form of carbon-related nanomaterials, currently attract wide attention for their potential applications in biomedical fields such as therapeutic medicine. Most endohedral metallofullerenes are synthesized using C60 or higher molecular weight fullerenes because of the limited interior volume of fullerene. It is known that the encapsulated metal atom has strong electronic interactions with the carbon cage in metallofullerenes. Gd@C82 is one of the most important molecules in the metallofullerene family, known as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) contrast agent candidate for diagnostic imaging. Gadolinium endohedral metallofullerenol (e.g., Gd@C82(OH)22) is a functionalized fullerene with gadolinium trapped inside carbon cage. Our group previously demonstrated that the distinctive chemical and physical properties of Gd@C82(OH)22 are dependent on the number and position of the hydroxyl groups on the fullerene cage. The present article summarizes our latest findings of biomedical effects of Gd@C82(OH)22 and gives rise to a connected flow of the existing knowledge and information from experts in the field. It briefly narrates the synthesis and physico-chemical properties of Gd@C82(OH)22. The polyhydroxylated nanoparticles exhibit the enhanced water solubility and high purity, and were tested as a MRI contrast agent. Gd@C82(OH)22 treatment inhibited tumor growth in tumor-bearing nude mice. Although the precise mechanisms of this action are not well defined, our in vitro data suggest involvements of improved immunity and antioxidation by Gd@C82(OH)22 and its size-based selective targeting to tumor site. The review critically analyzed the relevant data instead of fact-listing, and explained the potential for developing Gd@C82(OH)22 into a diagnostic or therapeutic agent.",nocancer
"Canadian Integrated Program for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance (CIPARS) Farm Program: results from finisher pig surveillance. In 2006, the Canadian Integrated Program for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance (CIPARS) Farm Program was implemented in sentinel grower-finisher swine herds in Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta. Herds were visited 1-3 times annually. Faecal samples were collected from pens of close-to-market (CTM) weight (>80 kg) pigs and antimicrobial use (AMU) data were collected via questionnaires. Samples were cultured for generic Escherichia coli and Salmonella and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility. This paper describes the findings of this program between 2006 and 2008. Eighty-nine, 115 and 96 herds participated in this program in 2006, 2007 and 2008 respectively. Over the 3 years, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) levels remained consistent. During this period, resistance to one or more antimicrobials was detected in 56-63% of the Salmonella spp. isolates and 84-86% of E. coli isolates. Resistance to five or more antimicrobials was detected in 13-23% of Salmonella and 12-13% of E. coli. Resistance to drugs classified as very important to human health (Category I) by the Veterinary Drug Directorate (VDD), Health Canada, was less than or equal to 1% in both organisms. AMU data were provided by 100 herds in 2007 and 95 herds in 2008. Nine herds in 2007 and five herds in 2008 reported no AMU. The most common route of antimicrobial administration (75-79% of herds) was via feed, predominantly macrolides/lincosamides (66-68% of herds). In both 2007 and 2008, the primary reasons given for macrolide/lincosamide use were disease prevention, growth promotion and treatment of enteric disease. The Category I antimicrobials, ceftiofur and virginiamycin were not used in feed or water in any herds in 2008, but virginiamycin was used in feed in two herds in 2007. Parenteral ceftiofur was used in 29 herds (29%) in 2007 and 20 herds (21%) in 2008. The reasons for ceftiofur use included treatment of lameness, respiratory disease and enteric disease.",nocancer
"C-reactive protein levels are elevated in asthma and asthma-like conditions. OBJECTIVE: Asthma is a chronic disease involving airway hyperresponsiveness. It was proposed that asthma/chronic shortness of breath elicit chronic systemic inflammation even in the absence of episodic events. DESIGN: Volunteers completed questionnaires relevant to asthma and/or dyspnea and consented to C-reactive protein (CRP) quantitation. Subject groups were: control (no reported dyspnea) and asthma/shortness of breath [dyspnea] group. SETTING: Studies were performed in the Saint Louis metropolitan area. PARTICIPANTS: Participants consisted of volunteers aged 18-57. Inclusion criteria were good health, not pregnant, weight > 110 pounds and absence of antiinflammatory medicine use. RESULTS: Serum CRP ranged from undetectable to 22,013 ng/mL. Mean results for asthmatic/dyspnea (n = 22) and control (n = 27) groups were 4,203 +/- 1,323 ng/mL and 1,741 +/- 467 ng/mL (p < 0.05) respectively. CONCLUSION: Individuals with asthma/asthma-like symptoms have chronic low levels of systemic inflammation despite the absence of episodic pulmonary events. Understanding chronic systemic inflammation relevant to asthma/asthma-like conditions may lead to design of targeted therapeutics.",nocancer
"Therapeutic delay and survival after surgery for cancer of the pancreatic head with or without preoperative biliary drainage. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relation between delay in surgery because of preoperative biliary drainage (PBD) and survival in patients scheduled for surgery for pancreatic head cancer. BACKGROUND: Patients with obstructive jaundice due to pancreatic head cancer can undergo PBD. The associated delay of surgery can lead to more advanced cancer stages at surgical exploration, affecting resection rate and survival. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, randomized controlled clinical trial to compare PBD with early surgery (ES) for pancreatic head cancer for complications. We obtained Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival for patients with pathology-proven malignancy and compared survival functions of ES and PBD groups using log-rank test statistics. Multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to evaluate the prognostic role of time to surgery for overall survival. RESULTS: Mean times from randomization to surgery were 1.2 (0.9-1.5) and 5.1 (4.8-5.5) weeks in the ES and PBD groups, respectively (P < 0.001). In the ES group, 60 (67%) of 89 patients underwent resection, versus 53 (58%) of 91 patients in the PBD group (P = 0.20). Median survival after randomization was 12.2 (9.1-15.4) months in the ES group versus 12.7 (8.9-16.6) months in the PBD group (P = 0.91). A longer time to surgery was significantly associated with slightly lower mortality rate after surgery (hazard ratio = 0.90, 95% CI, 0.83-0.97), when taking into account resection, bilirubin, complications, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, tumor-positive lymph nodes, and microscopically residual disease. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with pancreatic head cancer, the delay in surgery associated with PBD does not impair or benefit survival rate.",cancer
"Metal ion levels following resurfacing arthroplasty of the hip: serial results over a ten-year period. We report serum metal ion level data in patients with unilateral and bilateral hip resurfacing over a ten-year period. In these patients there is an increase in both cobalt and chromium levels above the accepted reference ranges during the first 18 months after operation. Metal ion levels remain elevated, but decline slowly for up to five years. However, the levels then appear to start rising again in some patients up to the ten-year mark. There was no significant difference in cobalt or chromium levels between men and women. These findings appear to differ from much of the current literature. The clinical significance of a raised metal ion level remains under investigation.",nocancer
"A genome-wide association study of Hodgkin's lymphoma identifies new susceptibility loci at 2p16.1 (REL), 8q24.21 and 10p14 (GATA3).

We identified three new susceptibility loci at 2p16.1 (rs1432295, REL, odds ratio (OR) = 1.22, combined P = 1.91 x 10(-8)), 8q24.21 (rs2019960, PVT1, OR = 1.33, combined P = 1.26 x 10(-13)) and 10p14 (rs501764, GATA3, OR = 1.25, combined P = 7.05 x 10(-8)). Furthermore, we confirmed the role of the major histocompatibility complex in disease etiology by revealing a strong human leukocyte antigen (HLA) association (rs6903608, OR = 1.70, combined P = 2.84 x 10(-50)). These data provide new insight into the pathogenesis of cHL.",cancer

"Twenty-five years of treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in Western Australia: how do we compare? OBJECTIVES: To compare survival among the subgroup of children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) who were treated at Princess Margaret Hospital for Children (PMH) in Perth, Western Australia, over 25 years under 15 consecutive protocols of the Children's Cancer Group (CCG) with survival for the entire cohort of children in multiple centres treated under CCG protocols in that period; and to highlight the benefits of membership of a large cooperative research group conducting multicentre randomised controlled trials. DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Retrospective review of the outcomes of all 311 children with newly diagnosed ALL treated at PMH between 1983 and 2008. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 4-year event-free survival; and 10-year overall survival. RESULTS: Four-year event-free survival for the entire PMH cohort increased from 66% (SE, 6%) for 1983-1987 to 88% (SE, 6%) for 2002-2005, while overall survival over the same period improved from 78% (SE, 5%) to 94% (SE, 4%). Comparisons of outcomes of children treated at PMH with those of the entire CCG cohort, protocol by protocol, revealed similar outcomes. CONCLUSION: Outcomes of children treated at PMH over the 25-year period are equivalent to those of the larger CCG cohort.",cancer
"Lymphoma: risk and response after solid organ transplant. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a common and serious complication of solid organ transplantation. It is a heterogeneous collection of diagnoses with varied clinical courses and outcomes. The majority of PTLD is Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-driven as a result of loss of immune control of EBV-positive B lymphocytes. Risk factors for the development of PTLD thus reflect loss or absence of EBV immunity; they include younger age and pre-transplant EBV naivety, as well as the degree and type of immune suppression, type of organ transplantation, and time from transplantation. Identifying patients at risk for PTLD and developing strategies to prevent PTLD is the subject of much research, and the use of antiviral medications and EBV vaccines has yielded intriguing, albeit preliminary, results. As we learn more about the prognostic factors affecting outcome and the pathogenesis of individual diseases, we are better able to tailor therapy to the individual. Further clinical investigation, including randomized controlled trials, will be important in reaching this goal.",nocancer
"Comparing the volume of gliomas in the brain in FLAIR and post-contrast T1-weighted MRI sequences. The imaging modality used to diagnose and monitor brain gliomas is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with standard protocols including contrast-enhanced T1-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) image sequences. Many clinical trials are currently using contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MR image sequences to evaluate tumor response to treatment, but it is our hypothesis that FLAIR sequences will detect higher tumor volumes and, therefore, should be the preferred image sequence for this purpose. In this retrospective study, a volumetric analysis was conducted on the post-contrast T1-weighted and FLAIR MR image sequences of 38 patients with confirmed brain gliomas. The two volumes were subsequently found to have a statistically significant positive correlation. The FLAIR volume was also found to be greater than the post-contrast T1-weighted volume in all 38 patients. As a result, FLAIR image sequences provide a more complete characterization of gliomas and may be more beneficial when observing tumor response after treatment.",cancer
"Minimally invasive diagnosis of sarcoidosis by EBUS when conventional diagnostics fail. BACKGROUND: Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial fine-needle aspiration (EBUS) is a minimally invasive method used routinely for mediastinal staging of patients with lung cancer. EBUS has also proved to be a valuable diagnostic tool for patients with different intrathoracic lesions who remain undiagnosed despite bronchoscopy and CT-guided fine-needle aspiration. OBJECTIVE: The present study focused on EBUS for diagnosing sarcoidosis. DESIGN: During a 3-year period 308 of 601 patients who underwent EBUS at our institution were referred for further diagnostic of a radiologically suspicious lesion in the lung parenchyma (n = 195), enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum (n = 89), a suspicious tumor in the mediastinum or pleural disease (n = 24) but no one had a definite histological diagnosis. All charts were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: Of the 308 patients 43 (14%) were eventually diagnosed with sarcoidosis. Thirty-three (77%) were diagnosed with EBUS. In the remaining 10 patients EBUS did not provide adequate tissue samples in 4 (9%) and in 6 patients (14%) EBUS provided adequate tissue but no definite diagnosis. EBUS was significantly better to establish the diagnosis in patients with enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes compared with isolated lung parenchymal involvement (85% vs 63%, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: EBUS is a valuable minimally invasive diagnostic modality to establish the diagnosis of sarcoidosis of unselected patients with undiagnosed intrathoracic lesions after conventional work up--particularly if patients have enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. This minimally invasive procedure provides a final diagnosis without exposing the patient to the risk of complications from more invasive procedures.",cancer
"Mullerian inhibiting substance inhibits invasion and migration of epithelial cancer cell lines. OBJECTIVE: Given the fact that Mullerian Inhibiting Substance (MIS) causes complex remodeling of the urogenital ridge and regression of the Mullerian ducts during male embryonic development, we examined whether MIS could affect similar cell properties such as migration and invasion that could contribute ultimately to micro-metastasis of cancers arising from Mullerian tissues. MIS receptor expressing cell lines found to be invasive and migratory in vivo are examined in an in vivo assay that is cost-effective. METHODS: We designed in vitro and in vivo experiments to determine if MIS inhibited the movement of cancer lines IGROV-1, HEp3, MDA-MB-231, and HT1080 in cell culture invasion/migration chamber assays and in chick embryo metastasis assays. RESULTS: MIS, at concentrations below those that inhibit cell proliferation, blocked in vitro invasion and in vivo migration of epithelial cancer cells that express the MIS receptor. CONCLUSIONS: While our laboratory has previously established MIS as an inhibitor of cancer cell proliferation using in vitro assays and in vivo xenografts, we now show that MIS can also inhibit in vivo tumor migration.",cancer
"Application of the multiple drugs immunoassay test for rapid detection of drug abuse in postmortem urine. OBJECTIVE: The ADVANCED QUALITY One Step Multi-Drug Screen test is a new urine on-site immunoassay test that is designed to detect multiple drugs of abuse in one time (barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), methamphetamine, and opiates group). Thus, the present research was done to evaluate the diagnostic performance of this test. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Urine samples obtained from corpses subjected to medicolegal autopsy at the forensic unit in Ramathibodi Hospital between October 2007 and March 2009 were used for the present study. The diagnostic performance of this immunoassay test was determined by using the results of the rapid emergency drug identification high sensitivity (REMEDi HS) system as the gold standard. RESULTS: Two hundred forty six urine samples were used in the present study. The sensitivity with their 95% confidence interval of cocaine, opiates, methamphetamine, and benzodiazepines assay was 100% (100-100%) each. The specificity with their 95% confidence interval of these was 100% (100-100%), 98% (96.75-99.94%), 95% (91.70-97.38%), and 93% (89.89-96.24%), respectively. The MDMA and barbiturates were not evaluated because there was no true positive result.

"HIV/AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma with multiple skin-mucosal disseminations following ultraviolet (puva) photochemotherapy. HIV/AIDS infection in Bulgaria has spread over about 1200 registered patients and it is supposed that the number of the undetected cases is four times higher. Kaposi's sarcoma is rarely observed in our country and no cutaneous-mucosal dissemination is reported for the time being. AIM: The aim of the study is to present a case of disseminated Kaposi's sarcoma in a HIV/ AIDS patient who underwent Psoralen--UVA radiation treatment (PUVA) for total alopecia. METHODS: HIV was proved through ELISA and Western blot (InnoLia HIV I/II Score). PCR method (COBAS-Amplicor HIV-1 MT, 1,5) was used to determine viral load (VL). Monitoring was realized by flow-cytometric phenotype analysis of the immune cells. Biopsy of a skin lesion was performed for histomorphological analysis. Computed axial tomography (CAT) of the visceral organs was also applied. RESULTS: The patient's face, chest, back and upper extremities are covered by more than 50 typical for Kaposi's sarcoma skin tumors and several isolated lesions are found in the oral cavity mucosa. The histological results show dilated vascular spaces with large endothelial cells and spindle-like tumor cells in irregularly formed fascicles. Monitoring of the immune cells and the viral load before and after the application of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) showed CD4+ T cell number = 0.147 x 10(9)/l and VL = 216 000 copies HIV-RNA/ml plasma when the disorder was first detected. A very good effect appeared 4 months after the HAART start: the mucous membrane lesions disappeared and the skin tumors decreased by number and dimensions. In the same time the CD4+ T cell number increased up to 0.255 x 10(9)/l and VL values decreased < 400 c/ml. CONCLUSION: Disseminated form of Kaposi's sarcoma can be provoked by additional immunosuppressive factors like the implementation of PUVA therapy. Early initiation of HAART improves the process and prevents visceral dissemination.",cancer

"Carcinoids and high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the ampulla of vater: a comparative analysis of 139 cases from the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results program-a population based study. CONTEXT: Neuroendocrine tumors of the ampulla of Vater constitute a heterogeneous group of neoplasms clinically and morphologically. Because they are rare, little is known about their demographics and biologic behavior. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the demographics and the 5- and 10-year relative survival rates of 139 patients with carcinoid tumors and high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the ampulla. DESIGN: Using data from National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program from 1973 to 2006, we analyzed the demographics, morphology, and survival of patients with carcinoids and neuroendocrine carcinomas of the ampulla. RESULTS: SEER recorded 6081 cases of malignant neoplasms of the ampulla, of which 82 were carcinoid tumors and 57 were high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas. Of these 57, 42 were neuroendocrine carcinomas, not otherwise specified; 9 were small cell carcinomas; and 6 were large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas. The incidence was higher in men than in women. Patients with carcinoid tumors were younger (mean age, 61.6 years) than those with high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (mean age, 67.5 years). Carcinoid tumors were smaller than high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas. The frequency of lymph node metastasis was 28.5% for carcinoid tumors and 62% for high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas. The 5- and 10-year relative survival rates of patients with carcinoid tumors were 82% and 71%, respectively. The 5- and 10-year relative survival rate of patients with high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas was 15.7%. CONCLUSIONS: Carcinoids of the ampulla of Vater are relatively rare. Carcinoids and high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the ampulla are biologically and clinically similar to these tumors arising in other sites.

A century ago Hashimoto described the histologic hallmarks of struma lymphomatosa: (1) lymphoid follicles, (2) changes in the epithelial cells, (3) formation of connective tissue, and (4) diffuse round cell infiltration. He also showed some cracking spaces close to lymphoid follicles resembling vessels. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible lymphatic nature of these spaces and their prevalence in non-neoplastic thyroid tissue. Ten cases of Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT), 5 of Basedow-Graves disease (BG), and 5 of normal thyroid tissue (NT) were selected. Tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, CD31 (Dako), and D2-40 (Dako) stains. Cracking spaces staining positive for CD31 and D2-40 stains were considered as lymphatic vessels. Site, distribution, intravascular valves and lymphocytes, perivascular lymphoid aggregates, and number and surface of lymphatic vessels were evaluated using a computer-assisted digital videocamera microscope (Nikon digital sigh, DS-2Mv). The number of lymphatic vessels increased from NT [3 (range, 2 to 13)] to BG [8 (range, 5 to 9)] to HT [12.5 (range, 10 to 16)]. A significant statistical difference was observed within the group (P=0.003): HT differed from NT (P=0.016) and BG (P=0.002). The area of lymphatic vessels increased from NT [0.01 mm (range, 0.01 to 0.12 mm2)] to BG [0.03 mm2 (range, 0.01 to 0.19 mm2)] to HT [0.03 mm (range, 0.01 to 0.6 mm2)]. A significant statistical difference was observed among the groups (P=0.001): NT differed from HT (P<0.001) and from BG (P<0.001). Lymphatic vessels showed valves, perivascular lymphoid aggregates, and intravascular lymphocytes. The cracking spaces shown by Hashimoto are mainly lymphatic vessels and represent a characteristic feature of autoimmune thyroid diseases.",nocancer
"Supply chain dynamics in healthcare services. PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to analyse health service supply chain systems. A great deal of literature is available on supply chain management in finished goods inventory situations; however, little research exists on managing service capacity when finished goods inventories are absent. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: System dynamics models for a typical service-oriented supply chain such as healthcare processes are developed, wherein three service stages are presented sequentially. FINDINGS: Just like supply chains with finished goods inventory, healthcare service supply chains also show dynamic behaviour. Comparing options, service reduction, and capacity adjustment delays showed that reducing capacity adjustment and service delays gives better results. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: The study is confined to health service-oriented supply chains. Further work includes extending the study to service-oriented supply chains with parallel processing, i.e. having more than one stage to perform a similar operation and also to study the behaviour in service-oriented supply chains that have re-entrant orders and applications. Specific case studies can also be developed to reveal factors relevant to particular service-oriented supply chains. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The paper explains the bullwhip effect in healthcare service-oriented supply chains. Reducing stages and capacity adjustment are strategic options for service-oriented supply chains. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The paper throws light on policy options for managing healthcare service-oriented supply chain dynamics.",nocancer
"Cytokeratin 19 fragment/carcinoembryonic antigen ratio in pleural effusion is a useful marker for detecting malignant pleural mesothelioma. BACKGROUND: The clinical utility of tumour markers in pleural effusion is still controversial with regard to the efficient detection of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cytokeratin 19 fragment (CYFRA 21-1) were retrospectively studied in pleural effusion of unknown origin in patients who had undergone medical thoracoscopy under local anaesthesia. RESULTS: The study included 134 patients (103 men and 31 women); among them, 33 had MPM. The level of pleural effusion CYFRA 21-1 and the CYFRA 21-1/CEA ratio were significantly different between MPM and other diseases (p<0.01). The sensitivity and specificity of the pleural effusion CYFRA 21-1/CEA ratio were 84.8% and 80.2%, respectively, when the CYFRA 21-1/CEA ratio cut-off value determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was 19.1. CONCLUSION: MPM should be suspected when the CYFRA 21-1/CEA ratio in pleural effusion is greater than 19.1.",cancer
"A gene signature-based approach identifies thioridazine as an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3'-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway in ovarian cancer cells. OBJECTIVE: Thioridazine, a derivative of phenothiazine, has been reported to have antiproliferative activity on tumor cells. However, the mechanism has not been well defined. METHODS: Using in-silico gene signature based approach, we have demonstrated that thioridazine could inhibit phosphatidylinositol-3'-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, and thus exert cytotoxicity in ovarian cancer cells. RESULTS: The Connectivity Map indicated that thioridazine induces gene signature similar to that of Akt inhibition. Moreover, preexisting inhibitors of PI3K/Akt pathway were also found to reveal similar signature. In SKOV-3 cells, immunoblot using p85 antibody showed that thioridazine could inhibit PI3K signal. In addition, thioridazine was found to inhibit p-Akt (Ser 473) in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, thioridazine was found to decrease cell viability and induce apoptosis. Exposure to thioridazine induced G(0)/G(1) arrest and down-regulated the cell cycle regulator, Cyclin D1 and CDK4, and up-regulated p21, p16, and p-CDC25A. Finally, additive cytotoxicity was observed when cisplatin and thioridazine were treated simultaneously. CONCLUSIONS: The current study indicated that in-silico approach, such as Connectivity Map, is a potentially useful method to identify the unknown cellular function among the drugs already in use in clinic. Owing to the property of Akt inhibition and additive cytotoxicity observed with the platinum compound, further research should be focused on this drug.",cancer
Mixed movement disorder as the presenting manifestation of non-ketotic hyperglycemia. Focal neurological symptoms may provide the first clue to the presence of nonketotic hyperglycemia (NKH). We report a patient with hemichorea-hemiballism (HC-HB) as the first manifestation of NKH. CT Brain revealed hyperdensity in bilateral globus pallidus (GP) and putamen predominantly on right side. Blood sugar was 580 mg/dl and s. osmolality was 316 mosm/l. This condition resolved after correction of hyperglycemia. The possible mechanism by which NKH causes this condition is discussed.,nocancer
"Sensitivity of low energy brachytherapy Monte Carlo dose calculations to uncertainties in human tissue composition. PURPOSE: The objective of this work is to assess the sensitivity of Monte Carlo (MC) dose calculations to uncertainties in human tissue composition for a range of low photon energy brachytherapy sources: 125I, 103Pd, 131Cs, and an electronic brachytherapy source (EBS). The low energy photons emitted by these sources make the dosimetry sensitive to variations in tissue atomic number due to the dominance of the photoelectric effect. This work reports dose to a small mass of water in medium D(w,m) as opposed to dose to a small mass of medium in medium D(m,m). METHODS: Mean adipose, mammary gland, and breast tissues (as uniform mixture of the aforementioned tissues) are investigated as well as compositions corresponding to one standard deviation from the mean. Prostate mean compositions from three different literature sources are also investigated. Three sets of MC simulations are performed with the GEANT4 code: (1) Dose calculations for idealized TG-43-like spherical geometries using point sources. Radial dose profiles obtained in different media are compared to assess the influence of compositional uncertainties. (2) Dose calculations for four clinical prostate LDR brachytherapy permanent seed implants using 125I seeds (Model 2301, Best Medical, Springfield, VA). The effect of varying the prostate composition in the planning target volume (PTV) is investigated by comparing PTV D90 values. (3) Dose calculations for four clinical breast LDR brachytherapy permanent seed implants using 103Pd seeds (Model 2335, Best Medical). The effects of varying the adipose/gland ratio in the PTV and of varying the elemental composition of adipose and gland within one standard deviation of the assumed mean composition are investigated by comparing PTV D90 values. For (2) and (3), the influence of using the mass density from CT scans instead of unit mass density is also assessed. RESULTS: Results from simulation (1) show that variations in the mean compositions of tissues affect low energy brachytherapy dosimetry. Dose differences between mean and one standard deviation of the mean composition increasing with distance from the source are observed. It is established that the 125I and 131Cs sources are the least sensitive to variations in elemental compositions while 103Pd is most sensitive. The EBS falls in between and exhibits complex behavior due to significant spectral hardening. Results from simulation (2) show that two prostate compositions are dosimetrically equivalent to water while the third shows D90 differences of up to 4%. Results from simulation (3) show that breast is more sensitive than prostate with dose variations of up to 30% from water for 70% adipose/30% gland breast. The variability of the breast composition adds a +/- 10% dose variation. CONCLUSIONS: Low energy brachytherapy dose distributions in tissue differ from water and are influenced by density, mean tissue composition, and patient-to-patient composition variations. The results support the use of a dose calculation algorithm accounting for heterogeneities such as MC. Since this work shows that variations in mean tissue compositions affect MC dosimetry and result in increased dose uncertainties, the authors conclude that imaging tools providing more accurate estimates of elemental compositions such as dual energy CT would be beneficial.",cancer
"Application of hTERC in thinprep samples with mild cytologic abnormality and HR-HPV positive. OBJECTIVE: Amplification of hTERC is found to be an important genetic event in the progression from cervical dysplasia to cervical cancer. The hTERC value in predicting high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), in high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) positive thinprep samples with atypical squamous cells (ASC) or a low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) was explored in this study. METHODS: A total of 300 thinprep cytology specimens (129 of ASC-US, 82 of LSIL, and 89 of ASC-H) with positive HR-HPV DNA was detected by a two-probe dual-color FISH panel, targeting hTERC and the centromeric region of chromosome 3 (CSP3). Using >2 signals for hTERC together with >/=2 signals for CSP3 to define abnormal nucleus, and the cutoff value was set at 6.5 per random 200 nuclei displayed increased hTERC signals and/or tumor ploidy. Statistical analyses were based on histologic findings of colposcopy biopsies, allowing CIN2 or worse (CIN2+) as the positive criterion. RESULTS: The FISH results were systematically analyzed among groups, based on histologic diagnosis, cytologic finding, HR-HPV viral load, and age status. hTERC presented good consistency with histology, and had satisfactory sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy among different groups, with less difference intergroup. The individual hTERC positive nuclei ratio was generally increased with severity of the cervical lesions. CONCLUSIONS: hTERC could be a stable predictor in assuring the risk of high-grade CIN in women with mild cytologic abnormality and positive HR-HPV, and the individual positive nuclei ratio of it might be helpful in identifying morbid grade for cervical lesions.",cancer
"Bioeffects of CdTe quantum dots on human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Quantum dots (QDs) hold great potential for applications in nanomedicine, however, their health effects are largely unknown. In the present study, the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of CdTe QDs were examined in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The QDs exhibited a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on cell growth. It was shown that after a 12 h treatment QDs at 1, 10, and 50 microg x ml(-1) induced formation of yH2AX foci, indicative of DNA damage, in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, QD treatment clearly induced the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Pre-treatment with N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), a ROS scavenger, could inhibit the induction of ROS by QDs, as well as the formation of yH2AX foci. Taken together, our data indicate that CdTe QDs have cytotoxic and genotoxic effects on HUVECs, and that ROS generation may be involved in QD induced DNA damage.",nocancer

"Pharmacological treatments for fatigue associated with palliative care. BACKGROUND: In healthy individuals, fatigue is a protective response to physical or mental stress, often relieved by rest. By contrast, in palliative care patients fatigue can be severely debilitating, thereby impacting daily activity and quality of life, often with rest not counteracting fatigue. Fatigue frequently occurs in patients with advanced disease and modalities treating cancer often contribute or cause fatigue. Further complicating issues are its multidimensionality, subjective nature, and lack of a consensus definition of fatigue. Pathophysiology is not fully understood and evidence-based treatment approaches are needed. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to determine efficacy of pharmacological treatments on non-specific fatigue in palliative care. The focus was on patients at an advanced stage of disease, including cancer and other chronic diseases associated with fatigue, aiming to relieve fatigue. Studies aiming at curative treatment (e.g. surgical intervention for early breast cancer) were not included. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched EMBASE; Psych Lit, CENTRAL and MEDLINE to June 2009. SELECTION CRITERIA: We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) concerning adult palliative care with focus on pharmacological treatment of fatigue. The primary outcome had to be non-specific fatigue (or related terms such as asthenia). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Results were screened and included if they met the selection criteria. If two or more studies were identified that investigated a specific drug in a population with the same disease, meta-analysis was conducted. In addition, comparison of type of drug investigated in a specific population as well as comparison of frequent adverse effects of fatigue treatment was done by creating overview tables. MAIN RESULTS: More than 2000 publications were screened, and 22 met inclusion criteria. In total, data from 11 drugs and 1632 participants were analysed. Studies investigating amantadine, pemoline, and modafinil in participants with Multiple Sclerosis (MS)-associated fatigue and methylphenidate in patients suffering from advanced cancer and fatigue could be used for meta-analysis. Amantadine in MS and methylphenidate in cancer patients showed a superior effect. Most studies had low participant numbers and were heterogenous. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on limited evidence, we cannot recommend a specific drug for treatment of fatigue in palliative care patients. Surprisingly, corticosteroids have not been a research focus for fatigue treatment, although these drugs are frequently used. Recent fatigue research seems to focus on modafinil, which may be beneficial although there is no evidence currently. Amantadine and methylphenidate should be further examined. Consensus regarding fatigue assessment in advanced disease is needed.",cancer
"Macroscopic sertoli cell nodule: a study of 6 cases that presented as testicular masses. Sertoli cell nodules are almost always incidental microscopic lesions found in both cryptorchid and normally descended testes. Sertoli cell nodules, when present as masses or ultrasonographic lesions, may create diagnostic confusion. Herein, we report 6 cases of macroscopic Sertoli cell nodules that were received in consultation. The referral diagnoses included Sertoli cell tumor (2 cases), sex cord tumor with annular tubules (1 case), and gonadoblastoma (1 case). The patients were 19 to 36 years old: 3 patients presented with palpable testicular masses and 3 with lesions that were worrisome for neoplasms in ultrasonographic examinations conducted for pain (2 cases) or infertility (1 case). All were phenotypically normal male patients who lacked endocrine symptoms. The Sertoli cell nodules ranged from 6 to 10 mm in diameter and on microscopic examination consisted of circumscribed proliferations of immature Sertoli cells, globules and trabeculae of basement membrane, and spermatogonia in varying proportions. In 2 cases the lesion was distinctly intratubular, consisting of closely packed tubules containing various components; in the other cases there was confluent growth of the tubules. Immunostains for alpha-inhibin highlighted the Sertoli cells (5 of 5 cases), with the germ cells appearing in negative relief. An antibody for testis-specific protein, Y-encoded (TSPY), stained the spermatogonia (2 of 2 cases), whereas OCT 3/4 was negative in all the cases (5 of 5 cases). We conclude that Sertoli cell nodules may present clinically as mass lesions, and that it is important to distinguish them from true neoplasms to avoid unnecessary procedures.",cancer
"Novel multi-functional life support system. Concepts of cardiopulmonary support (CPS), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and ventricular support (VS) have been thoroughly studied and refined. These perfusion adjuncts often require multiple devices, skill sets, and significant financial burden to purchase, maintain, deploy, and use. We describe a novel system that is rapidly deployable, user-friendly, portable, safe, and economical. Over a 1-year period we have used a multi-functional life support system (MLS) in the cardiac catheterization laboratory, cardiovascular intensive care unit, and cardiac surgical suites. Further, we have conducted multiple transports within the hospital and one to an alternate facility. Applications have included ECMO, cardiopulmonary resuscitation-supported cardiogenic shock, high risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), valvuloplasty, right ventricular assist device transition to ECMO post cardiotomy, left ventricular assist device transition to ECMO, ventricular septal defect closure, and ECMO transition to conventional cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Duration of support has ranged from approximately 39 minutes to several days.

"Predictive value of CD24 and CD44 for neoadjuvant chemotherapy response and prognosis in primary breast cancer patients. PURPOSE: We investigated the significance of CD24 and CD44 expression for predicting responses to chemotherapy and prognosis in primary breast cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Diagnosis of breast cancer was confirmed by core needle biopsy, and immunohistochemical studies were performed. Preoperatively, patients received anthracycline-containing chemotherapy. Expression of CD44 and CD24 was assessed immunohistochemically and the relationship with chemotherapy response and with prognosis was analyzed. RESULTS: Between 2001 and 2004, 139 women were enrolled in this study. In the correlation analysis, CD24 expression was negatively associated with pathological response to chemotherapy (p = 0.0003). A machine learning technique with an alternating decision tree (ADTree) showed that four logical rules are involved in predicting the response depending on the combination of CD24, HER2, tumor stage, CD44, progesterone receptor, and patient age. In the survival analysis, patients having CD44 (++) showed a significantly favorable prognosis as compared with others (p = 0.0002). A multivariate analysis showed that CD44 expression had an independent prognostic value (p < .0001). CONCLUSION: We found a significant correlation between CD44 expression and prognosis and between CD24 expression and response to chemotherapy. CD24 and CD44 expressions would be useful predictive markers, although further studies are needed.",cancer
"Comparison of low dose and standard dose adrenocorticotropin stimulation tests in healthy Nigerians. Hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction is a potentially life-threatening condition. It is of paramount importance that safe, reliable diagnostic tests be available to identify patients at risk for adrenal insufficiency. The 250 microg Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test is commonly used to assess adrenocortical function. The 250 microg dose is supraphysiological, therefore several investigators, over the years, have used 1 microg ACTH stimulation test to assess adrenocortical function. The aim of the study was to compare the response of healthy adult Nigerian subjects to the 250 microg and 1 microg ACTH tests. Ten healthy subjects, five males and five females, aged between 20-60 years, (mean, 38.7 years) participated in this study. They all had normal medical histories and physical examinations, were nonsmokers, and had never received any type of glucocorticoid therapy. Serum chemistries, full blood counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, were all within normal limits. Both low dose ACTH test and standard dose ACTH test were performed on the 10 subjects in a randomized order on different days.There was no statistically significant difference in mean serum cortisol levels between the two test doses at 30 minutes (928.4 vs 929.8 nmol/L). There was a strong correlation between 30-minute cortisol responses to 1 microg and 250 microg ACTH stimulation tests, r = 0.999; p < 0.001. In agreement with other published data, our study confirms that 1 microg ACTH stimulates adrenocortical secretion in normal subjects in the period 30 minutes post injection comparable to 250 microg ACTH testing.",nocancer
"Irradiation toxic effects during intra-arterial chemotherapy for retinoblastoma: should we be concerned? OBJECTIVE: To evaluate irradiation toxic effects from fluoroscopy during intra-arterial chemotherapy for retinoblastoma. DESIGN: Prospective trial. PARTICIPANTS: Eight patients treated with intra-arterial chemotherapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Irradiation toxic effects in vital organs. RESULTS: The mean patient age was 29 months (range, 10-74 months) and 63% were male. The mean irradiation dose to the skin of the affected eye was 0.19173 Gy, to the contralateral eye was 0.03533 Gy, to the chest wall was 0.00296 Gy, and to the abdominal wall was 0.00104 Gy. The estimated irradiation dose to the lens in the treatment eye was 0.16 Gy, which, in accumulated doses, could be cataractogenic. The estimated irradiation dose from a single fluoroscopy session to other organs, including the brain (0.05560 Gy), thyroid (0.00192 Gy), bone marrow (0.00059 Gy), and gonads (0.00015 Gy), was far lower than the minimal toxic level. CONCLUSIONS: Careful use of fluoroscopy during intra-arterial chemotherapy with limited irradiation exposure is advised. Accumulated irradiation toxic effects following multiple sessions of intra-arterial chemotherapy could be cataractogenic and possibly carcinogenic, especially in irradiation-sensitive patients with retinoblastoma.",cancer
"Could the eventual results of the NSABP* 39/RTOG** 0413 trial for partial breast irradiation (PBI) be improved by combining spherical applicators and whole breast irradiation? Radiobiology suggests it may. There may be unacceptable risks associated with the relatively large single doses of irradiation prescribed over five days instead of over six weeks for three of the four trial arms of the NSABP39/RTOG 0413 clinical trial seeking to enlist 4,300 patients. The first arm prescribes 60 Gray (Gy) in two Gy fractions over six weeks, which is the present standard. The dose implications of the other three arms with reference to this standard were examined using the ID2 formalism. Particularly poor (non-homogeneous) dose distributions characterise spherical applicators like ""MammoSite"" used as a sole device for accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). The alternative treatment, APBI done by 3-D conformal radiation, may also have a drawback, namely a sudden sharp cut-off in dose which may cause cosmetic problems due to circumscribed fibrosis and edema. Some recently published results from this trial reveal an alarming level of complications. The possible causes of these complications and poor cosmetic outcomes and how to avoid them are examined. An obstacle to the more widespread use of the ""MammoSite type of device is that the device is not allowed closer than 5-7 mm from the skin or ribs; a possible remedy for this restriction is offered. It is also intended to make the relevant radiobiological principles usable for surgical oncologists.",cancer
"Systematic review on mentoring and simulation in laparoscopic colorectal surgery. OBJECTIVE: To identify and evaluate the influence of mentoring and simulated training in laparoscopic colorectal surgery (LCS) and define the key components for learning advanced technical skills. BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic colorectal surgery is a complex procedure, often being self-taught by senior surgeons. Educational issues such as inadequate training facilities or a shortfall of training fellowships may result in a slow uptake of LCS. The effectiveness of mentored and simulated training, however, remains unclear. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search, using Ovid databases. Four study categories were identified: mentored versus nonmentored cases, training case selection, simulation, and assessment. We performed a meta-analysis and a mixed model regression on the difference of the main outcome measures (conversion rates, morbidity, and mortality) for mentored trainees and expert surgeons. We also compared conversion rates of mentored and nonmentored. Meta-analysis of risk factors for conversion was performed using published and unpublished data sets requested from various investigators. For studies on simulation, we compared scores of surveys on the perception of different training courses. RESULTS: Thirty-seven studies were included. Pooled weighted outcomes of mentored cases (n = 751) showed a lower conversion rate (13.3% vs 20.5%, P = 0.0332) compared with nonmentored cases (n = 695). Compared to expert case series (n = 5313), there was no difference in conversion (P = 0.2835), anastomotic leak (P = 0.8342), or mortality (P = 0.5680). A meta-analysis of training case selection data (n = 4444) revealed male sex (P < 0.0001), previous abdominal surgery (P = 0.0200), a BMI greater than 30 (P = 0.0050), an ASA of less than 2 (P < 0.0001), colorectal cancer (P < 0.0001) and intra-abdominal fistula (P < 0.0001), but not older than 64 years (P = 0.4800), to significantly increase conversion risk. Participants on cadaveric courses were highly satisfied with the teaching value yet trainees on an animal course gave less positive feedback. Structured assessment for LCS has been partially implemented. CONCLUSION: This review and meta-analysis supports evidence that trainees can obtain similar clinical results like expert surgeons in laparoscopic colorectal surgery if supervised by an experienced trainer. Cadaveric models currently provide the best value for training in a simulated environment. There remains a need for further research into technical skills assessment and the educational value of simulated training.",nocancer
"Update on immunologic therapy with anti-CTLA-4 antibodies in melanoma: identification of clinical and biological response patterns, immune-related adverse events, and their management. Immune-modifying monoclonal antibodies may induce or enhance the natural immune response against tumor cells. The complex interaction between antigen-presenting cells and T lymphocytes as an immune response is strongly affected by anti-CD152 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4, CTLA-4)-antibodies. However, specific CTLA-4 antibodies can block the CTLA-4 receptor and thus induce an unrestrained T-cell activation. To this stage, treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma with the CTLA-4 antibodies ipilimumab and tremelimumab has only been investigated within clinical trials. The results of a phase III trial in patients with advanced disease treated with ipilimumab alone or in combination with a peptide vaccination (gp100) recently presented at the 2010 annual meeting of the Ameircan Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) made groundbreaking news as ipilimumab was demonstrated to be the first drug in melanoma treatment to show a significant prolongation of survival time. Patients undergoing treatment with CTLA-4 antibodies may experience immune-related phenomena and adverse events (irAEs) that differ greatly from the well-known adverse events of cytotoxic drugs and which are due to the CTLA-4 antibodies' specific mode of action. This review gives a condensed overview on the mechanisms of action, an update on clinical data of the two CTLA-4 antibodies, ipilimumab and tremelimumab, and detailed recommendations for adverse event management strategies.",cancer
"Gender differences in the vocational satisfaction of physician assistants. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to analyze vocational satisfaction differences by gender as a follow-up of data gathered from a mailed survey study on American physician assistant vocational satisfaction. METHODS: This is an analysis of a database from an original piloted, validated survey with a response rate of 50% from 2,323 labels from the 2003 AAPA's mailing list (n = 1,137). The survey measured vocational satisfaction in terms of career, job, and specialty choice on a forced-choice 6-point Likert-type scale. A qualitative analysis of answers to open-ended questions addressing career satisfiers and dissatisfiers was also conducted. RESULTS: PAs were shown to be highly satisfied with their careers, specialty choices, and jobs. Trends for male PAs showed that they were more satisfied with their careers, specialty choices, and jobs (6-point Likert scale) but female PAs were more likely to refer others into the PA profession than their male counterparts (4-point Likert scale). Statistically significant differences via 2-tailed Mann-Whitney U tests were shown for job satisfaction (P = .02, male Likert mean 3.92 vs. female 3.78) and the likelihood to refer others into the profession (P = .04, female Likert mean 3.43 vs. male 3.33). Twenty-one factors for vocational satisfaction and 29 for dissatisfaction were qualitatively analyzed by gender. The top three satisfiers of helping others, patient interaction, and intellectual challenge were the same by rank regardless of gender. Similarly, the top three dissatisfiers were the same but in reverse order for female and male PAs: (lack of) respect, compensation, and other, for females; and other, compensation, and respect, for males. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated very similar vocational satisfaction measures for female PAs and male PAs via quantitative and qualitative methods with the noteworthy exception that male PAs were statistically more satisfied with their jobs while female PAs were statistically more likely to refer others into the career. These differences, while statistically significant, may be of no practical significance and need to be further studied.",nocancer
"B7-h3 ligand expression by primary breast cancer and associated with regional nodal metastasis. OBJECTIVE: : B7 ligand family members have been shown to be important immunoregulatory factors in host tumor immune responses. We hypothesized that B7-H3, a coinhibitory factor, is expressed by primary breast cancer cells and associated with metastasis to regional tumor-draining lymph nodes. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: : American Joint Committee on Cancer stage I to III primary breast cancers (n = 82) and normal breast specimens (n = 17) were assessed for B7-H3 expression using paraffin-embedded archival tissues. B7-H3 expression by breast cancer cells was assessed by a quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and B7-H3 protein expression was evaluated using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: : B7-H3 mRNA expression was detected in 32 of 82 (39%) primary breast tumors but not in normal breast tissues (P = 0.0029). B7-H3 expression in primary tumors significantly correlated with increasing tumor size, American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, and lymphovascular invasion (P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001, P = 0.0071). B7-H3 expression was highly correlated to sentinel lymph node and overall number of lymph nodes with metastasis P = 0.003, and P = 0.004, respectively). In a multivariate analysis, B7-H3 mRNA expression of the primary tumor significantly predicted metastasis to regional lymph nodes (P = 0.021, and P = 0.023, respectively). Antibody staining analysis of paraffin-embedded archival tissue breast tumors and flow cytometry of breast cancer cell lines demonstrated B7-H3 protein expression. CONCLUSIONS: : B7-H3 protein expressed by primary breast cancer cells is a tumor progression factor and is associated with extent of regional nodal metastasis.",cancer

"Keeping health facilities safe: one way of strengthening the interaction between disease-specific programmes and health systems. The debate on the interaction between disease-specific programmes and health system strengthening in the last few years has intensified as experts seek to tease out common ground and find solutions and synergies to bridge the divide. Unfortunately, the debate continues to be largely academic and devoid of specificity, resulting in the issues being irrelevant to health care workers on the ground. Taking the theme 'What would entice HIV- and tuberculosis (TB)-programme managers to sit around the table on a Monday morning with health system experts', this viewpoint focuses on infection control and health facility safety as an important and highly relevant practical topic for both disease-specific programmes and health system strengthening. Our attentions, and the examples and lessons we draw on, are largely aimed at sub-Saharan Africa where the great burden of TB and HIV AIDS resides, although the principles we outline would apply to other parts of the world as well. Health care infections, caused for example by poor hand hygiene, inadequate testing of donated blood, unsafe disposal of needles and syringes, poorly sterilized medical and surgical equipment and lack of adequate airborne infection control procedures, are responsible for a considerable burden of illness amongst patients and health care personnel, especially in resource-poor countries. Effective infection control in a district hospital requires that all the components of a health system function well: governance and stewardship, financing,infrastructure, procurement and supply chain management, human resources, health information systems, service delivery and finally supervision. We argue in this article that proper attention to infection control and an emphasis on safe health facilities is a concrete first step towards strengthening the interaction between disease-specific programmes and health systems where it really matters - for patients who are sick and for the health care workforce who provide the care and treatment.",nocancer
"Prenatal micronutrient supplementation and intellectual and motor function in early school-aged children in Nepal. CONTEXT: Iron and zinc are important for the development of both intellectual and motor skills. Few studies have examined whether iron and zinc supplementation during gestation, a critical period of central nervous system development, affects children's later functioning. OBJECTIVE: To examine intellectual and motor functioning of children whose mothers received micronutrient supplementation during pregnancy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cohort follow-up of 676 children aged 7 to 9 years in June 2007-April 2009 who had been born to women in 4 of 5 groups of a community-based, double-blind, randomized controlled trial of prenatal micronutrient supplementation between 1999 and 2001 in rural Nepal. Study children were also in the placebo group of a subsequent preschool iron and zinc supplementation trial. INTERVENTIONS: Women whose children were followed up had been randomly assigned to receive daily iron/folic acid, iron/folic acid/zinc, or multiple micronutrients containing these plus 11 other micronutrients, all with vitamin A, vs a control group of vitamin A alone from early pregnancy through 3 months postpartum. These children did not receive additional micronutrient supplementation other than biannual vitamin A supplementation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Children's intellectual functioning, assessed using the Universal Nonverbal Intelligence Test (UNIT); tests of executive function, including go/no-go, the Stroop test, and backward digit span; and motor function, assessed using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children (MABC) and finger-tapping test. RESULTS: The difference across outcomes was significant (Bonferroni-adjusted P < .001) for iron/folic acid vs control but not for other supplement groups. The mean UNIT T score in the iron/folic acid group was 51.7 (SD, 8.5) and in the control group was 48.2 (SD, 10.2), with an adjusted mean difference of 2.38 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.06-4.70; P = .04). Differences were not significant between the control group and either the iron/folic acid/zinc (0.73; 95% CI, -0.95 to 2.42) or multiple micronutrient (1.00; 95% CI, -0.55 to 2.56) groups. In tests of executive function, scores were better in the iron/folic acid group relative to the control group for the Stroop test (adjusted mean difference in proportion who failed, -0.14; 95% CI, -0.23 to -0.04) and backward digit span (adjusted mean difference, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.01-0.71) but not for the go/no-go test. The MABC score was lower (better) in the iron/folic acid group compared with the control group but not after adjustment for confounders (mean difference, -1.47; 95% CI, -3.06 to 0.12; P = .07). Finger-tapping test scores were higher (mean difference, 2.05; 95% CI, 0.87-3.24; P = .001) in the iron/folic acid group. CONCLUSION: Aspects of intellectual functioning including working memory, inhibitory control, and fine motor functioning among offspring were positively associated with prenatal iron/folic acid supplementation in an area where iron deficiency is prevalent.

"Gastric cardiac polyps: a clinicopathologic study of 330 cases. As endoscopists have become more skilled in sampling the gastroesophageal junction, pathologists are being increasingly challenged to characterize previously unknown or neglected findings. One such example is the cardiac polyp. Originally described in the radiology literature as the sentinel fold, the first histologic descriptions of polyps at the gastroesophageal junction did not appear until less than a decade ago. Current clinicopathologic information is limited and somewhat conflicting. This study was designed to define the clinical, endoscopic, and histopathologic associations in patients with cardiac polyps. Using an electronic database, we extracted information on all patients who had a distal esophageal or esophagogastric junctional biopsy during a 24-month period. We then reviewed the slides of 330 adult patients diagnosed with a cardiac polyp and used semiquantitative or qualitative scales to score foveolar hyperplasia, inflammation, erosion or ulcers, epithelial type, and metaplasia. As controls we used 120,487 patients who had biopsies from the same anatomic sites during the same period, but were not diagnosed with a cardiac polyp. There were no significant differences among any clinical indications for esophagogastroduodenoscopy between study and control patients. Endoscopically, a polyp or nodule at the gastroesophageal junction was noted in 59.1% of the patients who had a histopathologic diagnosis of cardiac polyp. Histologically, Barrett mucosa, active esophagitis, and Helicobactor pylori gastritis were all significantly less common in patients with a cardiac polyp than in controls. Although relatively infrequent, synchronous hyperplastic polyps elsewhere in the stomach were significantly more common in patients than in controls. In conclusion, this large series suggests that cardiac polyps are rare but histologically distinct lesions. They are benign and are not uniquely associated with esophagitis, Barrett esophagus, gastroesophageal reflux disease, reactive gastropathy, or gastritis, with or without H. pylori.",cancer
"Evaluation and management of pediatric febrile seizures in the emergency department. Febrile seizures are common in children, who are often brought to the nearest emergency department (ED). Patients who meet the case definition of simple febrile seizure are not at higher risk for serious bacterial illness than clinically similar febrile children who have not experienced a convulsion. Children who have had complex febrile seizures must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and treated with diagnostic and therapeutic measures based on the differential diagnosis. Round-the-clock prophylactic administration of antipyretics has not been demonstrated to affect recurrence of simple febrile seizure. Parents should be informed that recurrence is common, and that these convulsions are benign with an excellent prognosis. Care-givers should be informed that the risk of developing epilepsy after a simple febrile seizure is low, but that complex febrile seizures carry a significantly higher risk.",nocancer
"Valve-preserving root replacement in bicuspid aortic valves. OBJECTIVE: Bicuspid aortic valve anatomy is associated with aortic root aneurysm in a relevant proportion of patients. These patients require root replacement for prognostic reasons, and the valve may be preserved. The objective of this analysis is to analyze the early and late outcomes of root remodeling for bicuspid aortic valve. METHODS: Between November 1995 and December 2009, 153 patients (133 male) were treated by root remodeling in the presence of a bicuspid aortic valve. Acute dissection was present in 6 individuals. In 137 instances, additional correction of cusp pathology was achieved by plication (n = 119), triangular resection (n = 59), and implantation of a pericardial patch (n = 27). Follow-up ranges from 3 months to 14.5 years (mean, 4.9 +/- 3.8 years; cumulative, 757 years) and is complete in 99.3%. RESULTS: One patient died of intracranial hemorrhage in the hospital (mortality 0.7%). Survival at 5 and 10 years was 99% and 91%, respectively. Seven patients required reoperation for stenosis (n = 1) or recurrent aortic insufficiency (n = 6) between 1 month and 11 years postoperatively. The aortic valve was re-repaired in 2 cases. Freedom from reoperation at 5 and 10 years was 95%; freedom from valve replacement was 97%. Freedom from valve-related complications was 91% at 5 and 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: Root remodeling for aortic root aneurysm in the presence of a bicuspid aortic valve can be performed with a low morbidity and mortality. The long-term stability of the reconstructed aortic valve is excellent if normal valve configuration is achieved. The occurrence of late stenosis seems to be rare, and freedom from valve-related complications is high.",nocancer
"Second-generation substituted quinolines as anticancer drugs for breast cancer. Cancer cells have reduced capacity for gap junctional inter-cellular communication (GJIC). One feasible approach to reduce growth of cancer cells is to enhance GJIC. This report shows that a second-generation substituted quinoline, PQ7, has anti-tumor effect. Scrape load/dye transfer and colony growth assays were performed to measure GJIC and tumor formation of T47D breast cancer cells. PQ7 at 500 nM induced a 16-fold increase in the GJIC in T47D cells. In addition to an increase in GJIC, a 50% decrease of colony growth was observed with 100 nM of PQ7. PQ7-treated nu/nu mice showed a 100% regression of xenograft tumor growth of T47D cells. The results show that PQ7 has a promising role in exerting anti-tumor activity in human breast cancer cells.",cancer
"Obesity and microvascular invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma. BACKGROUND: We hypothesized that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with higher Body Mass Index (BMI) might have more microvascular invasion (MVI) in their tumors. METHODS: Records from 138 consecutive patients who underwent surgery at Columbia University Medical Center from January 1, 2002 to January 9, 2008 were evaluated. RESULTS: 40 patients (29%) had MVI, including 14% with BMI <25, 31% with BMI = 25-30, and 40% with BMI >30 (p = .05). However, only maximum alpha-fetoprotein was significantly associated with overall mortality in a Cox model. CONCLUSIONS: MVI was associated with obesity. A better understanding of the mechanism of this association may lead to interventions for the treatment and prevention of HCC.",cancer
"Conventional physical therapy with lumbar traction; clinical evaluation and magnetic resonance imaging for lumbar disc herniation. OBJECTIVE: This study measures and compares the outcome of conservative physical therapy with traction, by using magnetic resonance imaging and clinical parameters in patients presenting with low back pain caused by lumbar disc herniation. METHODS: A total of 26 patients with LDH (14F, 12M with mean aged 37 +/- 11) were enrolled in this study and 15 sessions (per day on 3 weeks) of physical therapy were applied. That included hot pack, ultrasound, electrotherapy and lumbar traction. Physical examination of the lumbar spine, severity of pain, sleeping order, patient and physician global assessment with visual analogue scale, functional disability by HAQ, Roland Disability Questionnaire, and Modified Oswestry Disability Questionnaire were assessed at baseline and at 4-6 weeks after treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging examinations were carried out before and 4-6 weeks after the treatment RESULTS: All patients completed the therapy session. There were significant reductions in pain, sleeping disturbances, patient and physician global assessment and disability scores, and significant increases in lumbar movements between baseline and follow-up periods. There were significant reductions of size of the herniated mass in five patients, and significant increase in 3 patients on magnetic resonance imaging after treatment, but no differences in other patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that conventional physical therapies with lumbar traction were effective in the treatment of patient with subacute LDH. These results suggest that clinical improvement is not correlated with the finding of MRI. Patients with LDH should be monitored clinically (Fig. 3, Ref. 18).",nocancer
"A novel drug and gene co-delivery system based on Poly(epsilon-caprolactone)-Poly(ethylene glycol)-Poly(epsilon-caprolactone) grafted polyethyleneimine micelle. In this paper, we prepared a novel cationic self-assembled micelle from poly(epsilon-caprolactone)-poly(ethyl glycol)-poly(epsilon-caprolactone) grafted polyethyleneimine (PCEC-g-PEI). The PCEC-g-PEI micelles, formed by self-assembly method, had mean particle size of ca. 82 nm and zeta potential of +22.5 mV at 37 degrees C, and could efficiently transfer pGFP into HEK293 cells in vitro. Meanwhile, as a model hydrophobic chemotherapeutic drug, honokiol was loaded into PCEC-g-PEI micelles by direct dissolution method assisted by ultrasonication. The honokiol loaded cationic PCEC-g-PEI micelles could effectively adsorb DNA onto its surface, while it could release honokiol in an extended period in vitro. This study demonstrated a novel DNA and hydrophobic chemotherapeutic drug co-delivery system.",nocancer
"Differential suppression of proliferation in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells exposed to alpha-, gamma- and delta-tocotrienols is accompanied by altered expression of oxidative stress modulatory enzymes. Tocotrienols belong to the vitamin E family of chemicals known to have potent anti-proliferative and apoptotic activities against a variety of cancer cells with little to no comparable influence on the normal cells. Whether tocotrienols control the expression of phase II antioxidant enzymes in the context of their anti-carcinogenic mechanisms has not been investigated. The present studies were performed to test whether the differential growth inhibition resulting from exposure to alpha-, gamma- and delta-tocotrienols in estrogen receptor-positive human MCF-7 and estrogen receptor-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells might be accompanied by changes in phase II antioxidant enzymes. Cell proliferation and clonogenicity in both cell lines were significantly inhibited by gamma- and delta-tocotrienols with little affect when cells were similarly exposed to alpha-tocotrienol, at doses up to 10 muM. The expression and activity of several antioxidant enzymes in 10 muM tocotrienol-treated cells were determined by Western blot and biochemical assays. In MDA-MB-231 cells, delta- was more active than alpha- or gamma-tocotrienols in up-regulating glutathione peroxidase; however, the three tocotrienols had comparable activity in inducing thioredoxin. In MCF-7 cells, expression of quinone reductase 2 and thioredoxin was increased by gamma- and delta-tocotrienols, whereas quinone reductase 1 was unaffected by exposure to the tocotrienols. The tocotrienols also did not affect the expression and activity of superoxide dismutase in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, but increased catalase activity concomitant with slight reduction in the catalase expression. In MDA-MB-231 cells, treatment by tocotrienols led to several fold increase of NRF2 expression marked by corresponding decrease in KEAP1 levels. By contrast, no significant change in NRF2 and KEAP1 levels was observed in MCF-7 cells. These studies demonstrate that different tocotrienols show distinct and selective activity in regulating the NRF2-KEAP1, in coordination with the induced expression of cytoprotective oxidative stress modulatory genes and regulation of proliferation in breast cancer cells.",cancer

"A comparison of radiotherapy with radiotherapy plus surgery for brain metastases from urinary bladder cancer: analysis of 62 patients. PURPOSE: To evaluate the role of radiotherapy (RT) and prognostic factors in 62 patients with brain metastases from transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the urinary bladder. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 62 patients received either RT (n = 49), including whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and/or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), or surgery (OP) combined with WBRT (n = 13). Overall survival (OS), intracerebral control (ICC) and local control (LC) were retrospectively analyzed. Six potential prognostic factors were assessed: age, gender, number of brain metastases, extracerebral metastases, recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) class, and interval from tumor diagnosis to RT. RESULTS: Median OS and ICC for the entire cohort were 9 and 7 months. No significant difference between RT and OP + RT was found for OS (p = 0.696) and ICC (p = 0.996). On multivariate analysis, improved OS was associated with lack of extracerebral metastases (p < 0.001) and RPA class (p < 0.001), and ICC with the latter (p < 0.001). SRS-incorporating RT resulted in 1-, 2-, and 3-year LC probability of 78%, 66%, and 51%. No association between LC and any of the potential prognostic factors was observed. The results of the subgroup RPA class analyses were similar to the entire cohort. CONCLUSION: Patient outcome for the RT-alone arm was not significantly different from OP + RT. SRS-incorporating treatment offers excellent LC rates. RPA class and the presence of extracerebral metastases demonstrated a significant prognostic role for survival. The latter should be used as stratification factors in randomized trials and can help define the cohort of patients that may benefit from more aggressive therapies.",cancer
"Masking the unpleasant taste of etoricoxib by crosslinked acrylic polymer based ion-exchange resin complexation. Etoricoxib is an antiinflammatory and analgesic agent in the treatment of arthritis, dysmenorrhoea, acute dentalsurgerypain and is having a bitter taste. The present study is designed to mask the bitter taste of etoricoxib by complexation with weak cation exchange resins (Indion 214, 234 and 414) in order to increase its compatibility and patient compliance. Drug resinates were characterized by FTIR and XRD analysis methods. Drug resinates were evaluated by sensory taste evaluation test. Indion 234 resin was showing good taste masking ability compared to Indion 214 and 414.

"Non-specific effects of standard measles vaccine at 4.5 and 9 months of age on childhood mortality: randomised controlled trial. OBJECTIVE: To examine in a randomised trial whether a 25% difference in mortality exists between 4.5 months and 3 years of age for children given two standard doses of Edmonston-Zagreb measles vaccines at 4.5 and 9 months of age compared with those given one dose of measles vaccine at 9 months of age (current policy). DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial. SETTING: The Bandim Health Project, Guinea-Bissau, which maintains a health and demographic surveillance system in an urban area. PARTICIPANTS: 6648 children aged 4.5 months of age who had received three doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine at least four weeks before enrolment. A large proportion of the children (80%) had previously taken part in randomised trials of neonatal vitamin A supplementation. INTERVENTION: Children were randomised to receive Edmonston-Zagreb measles vaccine at 4.5 and 9 months of age (group A), no vaccine at 4.5 months and Edmonston-Zagreb measles vaccine at 9 months of age (group B), or no vaccine at 4.5 months and Schwarz measles vaccine at 9 months of age (group C). Main outcome measure Mortality rate ratio between 4.5 and 36 months of age for group A compared with groups B and C. Secondary outcomes tested the hypothesis that the beneficial effect was stronger in the 4.5 to 9 months age group, in girls, and in the dry season, but the study was not powered to test whether effects differed significantly between subgroups. RESULTS: In the intention to treat analysis of mortality between 4.5 and 36 months of age the mortality rate ratio of children who received two doses of Edmonston-Zagreb vaccine at 4.5 and 9 months of age compared with those who received a single dose of Edmonston-Zagreb vaccine or Schwarz vaccine at 9 months of age was 0.78 (95% confidence interval 0.59 to 1.05). In the analyses of secondary outcomes, the intention to treat mortality rate ratio was 0.67 (0.38 to 1.19) between 4.5 and 9 months and 0.83 (0.83 to 1.16) between 9 and 36 months of age. The effect on mortality between 4.5 and 36 months of age was significant for girls (intention to treat mortality rate ratio 0.64 (0.42 to 0.98)), although this was not significantly different from the effect in boys (0.95 (0.64 to 1.42)) (interaction test, P=0.18). The effect did not differ between the dry season and the rainy season. As neonatal vitamin A supplementation is not WHO policy, the analyses were done separately for the 3402 children who did not receive neonatal vitamin A. In these children, the two dose Edmonston-Zagreb measles vaccine schedule was associated with a significantly lower mortality between 4.5 and 36 months of age (intention to treat mortality rate ratio 0.59 (0.39 to 0.89)). The effect was again significant for girls but not statistically significant from the effect in boys. When measles cases were censored, the intention to treat mortality rate ratio was 0.65 (0.43 to 0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Although the overall effect did not reach statistical significance, the results may indicate that a two dose schedule with Edmonston-Zagreb measles vaccine given at 4.5 and 9 months of age has beneficial non-specific effects on children's survival, particularly for girls and for children who have not received neonatal vitamin A. This should be tested in future studies in different locations. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical trials NCT00168558.",nocancer
"Pharmacy experience with facsimile prescriptions. The purpose of this mixed qualitative/quantitative study was to review the impact of a policy to accept facsimile (fax) prescriptions as standard operating procedure. Between February and April 2009 the pharmacy processed 4,792 new prescriptions of which 363 (7.6%) were received through fax. Of the fax prescriptions, 19 (5.2%) concerned clarification of information, which took approximately 30 minutes to resolve. The fax prescription process allowed the pharmacy to adjust the distribution of its workload, provided quicker service for new prescriptions, and allowed more time for medication consultation that resulted in a high level of customer satisfaction. It appeared the policy allowing fax prescriptions was a ""win-win"" situation for both the pharmacy and its customers. Military pharmacies should consider running trials of accepting fax prescriptions to see whether it improves their prescription filling process.",nocancer
"The Dental Values Scale: development and validation. The purpose of this study was to produce a valid scale for use in measuring the values of dental students and practitioners--the lack of which has impeded research on professionalism in dentistry. Following standard scale development procedures, we had focus groups of dental practitioners (N=23) develop a ninety-nine-item pool of value terms related to dentistry. Next, Canadian dentists (N=449) rated the relevance of each item through an online survey. They also rated the values in a generic values measure, Schwartz's Values Scale. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses identified twenty-five items representing five values: Altruism, Personal Satisfaction, Conscientiousness, Quality of Life, and Professional Status. These values correlate with related dimensions from Schwartz's measure; they also correspond to the values in the American Dental Education Association's statement on professionalism. We then administered the new Dental Values Scale to dental students (N=96) to determine the relationship between practitioner and student values. First-year students were higher in Conscientiousness, Altruism, and Personal Satisfaction than practitioners, but these values decreased over time to those held by the dentists. We discuss the implication of these results and the potential value of the new scale for dental education.",nocancer
"Delay and causes of delay in the diagnosis of childhood cancer in Africa. BACKGROUND: Although a few studies have investigated delays in diagnosis and treatment among children and adolescents with cancer, this has never been subject of study in South Africa. Early diagnosis is fundamental as it allows timely treatment and prevents unnecessary complications. PROCEDURES: Combined prospective and retrospective study of 194 children with cancer at Tygerberg Hospital, Cape Town, diagnosed between 2000 and 2009: 126 patients were included through review of the medical charts and 68 through interviews with the parents. RESULTS: The median total diagnosis delay was 34 days (2-1,826). The median patient delay was 5 days (0-457). The median physician delay was 20 days (0-924). Gender, age or ethnicity of the children, as well as parental level of education did not have a significant influence on the total time to diagnosis. Initial misdiagnoses were frequent (58%). CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable delay in diagnosing childhood cancer in the area served by Tygerberg Hospital, due mostly to a physician delay of 20 days on average. The findings of our unit should be correlated with other South African centers. There is a clear need to increase parental awareness of childhood cancer and to intensify the education of nurses and doctors with regard to the warning signs of the disease.",cancer

"Neuroendocrine tumors of the lung: an update. CONTEXT: The 2004 World Health Organization (WHO) classification recognizes 4 major types of lung neuroendocrine tumors: typical carcinoid, atypical carcinoid, small cell lung cancer, and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. Markedly different prognostic implications and treatment paradigms for these tumors underscore the importance of accurate pathologic diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: To detail the clinical and pathologic features of lung neuroendocrine tumors, with emphasis on diagnostic criteria, differential diagnoses, and application of immunohistochemistry. The emerging evidence for the utility of Ki-67 (MIB1) in the diagnosis of lung neuroendocrine tumors, particularly in small biopsy and cytology, is emphasized. DATA SOURCES: The 2004 WHO classification, other published literature, and primary material from the author's institution. CONCLUSIONS: The current WHO classification of neuroendocrine tumors is based on morphologic features in combination with precisely defined mitotic rate and absence or presence of necrosis. Ki-67 (MIB1) is emerging as a useful ancillary tool in the diagnosis of these tumors. Continued research efforts are needed to identify additional immunohistochemical and molecular biomarkers that can serve as ancillary diagnostic tools and as potential therapeutic targets for these diseases.",cancer
"Temporal trends in rates of patient harm resulting from medical care. BACKGROUND: In the 10 years since publication of the Institute of Medicine's report To Err Is Human, extensive efforts have been undertaken to improve patient safety. The success of these efforts remains unclear. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of a stratified random sample of 10 hospitals in North Carolina. A total of 100 admissions per quarter from January 2002 through December 2007 were reviewed in random order by teams of nurse reviewers both within the hospitals (internal reviewers) and outside the hospitals (external reviewers) with the use of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's Global Trigger Tool for Measuring Adverse Events. Suspected harms that were identified on initial review were evaluated by two independent physician reviewers. We evaluated changes in the rates of harm, using a random-effects Poisson regression model with adjustment for hospital-level clustering, demographic characteristics of patients, hospital service, and high-risk conditions. RESULTS: Among 2341 admissions, internal reviewers identified 588 harms (25.1 harms per 100 admissions; 95% confidence interval [CI], 23.1 to 27.2) [corrected]. Multivariate analyses of harms identified by internal reviewers showed no significant changes in the overall rate of harms per 1000 patient-days (reduction factor, 0.99 per year; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.04; P=0.61) or the rate of preventable harms. There was a reduction in preventable harms identified by external reviewers that did not reach statistical significance (reduction factor, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.00; P=0.06), with no significant change in the overall rate of harms (reduction factor, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.04; P=0.47). CONCLUSIONS: In a study of 10 North Carolina hospitals, we found that harms remain common, with little evidence of widespread improvement. Further efforts are needed to translate effective safety interventions into routine practice and to monitor health care safety over time. (Funded by the Rx Foundation.).",nocancer

"Risk factors for refractive errors in primary school children (6-12 years old) in Nakhon Pathom Province. BACKGROUND: Refractive error is one of the leading causes of visual impairment in children. An analysis of risk factors for refractive error is required to reduce and prevent this common eye disease. OBJECTIVE: To identify the risk factors associated with refractive errors in primary school children (6-12 year old) in Nakhon Pathom province. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A population-based cross-sectional analytic study was conducted between October 2008 and September 2009 in Nakhon Pathom. Refractive error, parental refractive status, and hours per week of near activities (studying, reading books, watching television, playing with video games, or working on the computer) were assessed in 377 children who participated in this study. RESULTS: The most common type of refractive error in primary school children was myopia. Myopic children were more likely to have parents with myopia. Children with myopia spend more time at near activities. The multivariate odds ratio (95% confidence interval)for two myopic parents was 6.37 (2.26-17.78) and for each diopter-hour per week of near work was 1.019 (1.005-1.033). Multivariate logistic regression models show no confounding effects between parental myopia and near work suggesting that each factor has an independent association with myopia. CONCLUSION: Statistical analysis by logistic regression revealed that family history of refractive error and hours of near-work were significantly associated with refractive error in primary school children.",nocancer
"Concordant analysis of KRAS status in primary colon carcinoma and matched metastasis. KRAS somatic mutations are the main predictive factor for non response to EGFR-targeted monoclonal antibodies in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients. We compared KRAS mutational status in the primary tumour and the corresponding metastases (1 to 4 sites) in 38 mCRC patients. KRAS mutational status was analysed using direct sequencing, SNAPShot multiplex PCR and Scorpion Taqman PCR analysis. Results showed 54% of primary tumours had KRAS mutations. A concordance of 97% between primaries and metastatic sites was observed. A tumour heterogeneity was also demonstrated in 5% of mCRC. One case with three different primary tumours harboured three different KRAS mutations, and only one was represented in the unique metastasis of this patient. We concluded there was a high concordance in the KRAS status between the primary tumour and metastases. More than one informative block and more sensitive assay may increase the accuracy of KRAS status determination.",cancer
"Repeated chemosensitivity testing in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma. Epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) is a highly chemosensitive tumor, but most patients with advanced EOC initially responding to first-line chemotherapy will eventually relapse. Chemosensitivity testing may offer an opportunity for the optimal selection of chemotherapeutic agents for individual patients. In the present retrospective analysis we have examined the changes in chemosensitivity profiles during the course of the disease. Chemosensitivity was determined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) test. Two or more samples at least 14 days apart were obtained from 34 patients with ovarian cancer. Chemoresistance increased significantly at the second measurement only for paclitaxel and carboplatin, the most frequently used cytotoxic drugs. No significant difference compared to baseline was observed at subsequent measurements for any other cytotoxic agent studied, although a non-significant trend for increased chemoresistance was observed. In conclusion, in the present cohort only paclitaxel and carboplatin chemosensitivity changed significantly, although to a limited extent, during the course of the disease. In contrast to a limited increase of paclitaxel and carboplatin chemoresistance, no significant changes were observed for other cytotoxic agents examined. The present data indicate that chemoresistance increases, to a modest extent, against the drug most frequently used, but remains relatively stable during the course of disease, especially for agents that are not used in the therapeutic regimen.",cancer
"Non-malignant haematology research in the UK: looking forward to new opportunities. Over the last few years there has been rapid and radical change in the way clinical research in the UK is funded and supported within the NHS. This has resulted from restructuring and major new investment in research infrastructure, co-ordinated through Clinical Local Research Networks (CLRNs) and equivalent organisations in the devolved nations. CLRNs have resources to support local researchers undertake studies that have been adopted on to the national research portfolio. For example, CLRNs can help with gaining local approvals or provide research nurses to recruit patients, undertake study procedures and perform data entry. CLRNs can establish Local Speciality Groups in a number of areas of medicine, including nonmalignant haematology. These new networks offer non-malignant haematology access to significant new resources and a major opportunity to support clinical research for the benefit of our patients.",nocancer
"Obstructive uropathy following radiation therapy in carcinoma of the uterine cervix. Eighty-three cases of carcinoma of the cervix presenting over a 5-year period, 1997 to 2001 were considered for evaluation of the effects of Irradiation on the urinary tract. Ultrasound scans were used to detect ureteric obstructions in the follow-up period. Significant progressive ureteric obstruction occurred in 6 patients (7.2%), all of whom had malignant strictures. The diagnoses of these strictures were made between 8 months and five years after the Initial treatment. Patients having malignant stricture tend to be in a higher original stage of tumour. The lower ureter was the site of ureteric obstruction in 4 patients while 2 had lesions in middle ureter. The latency period between primary treatment of the tumour and diagnosis of uropathy is significantly shorter for malignant strictures. The site of occurrence of the strictures had no discernible significance but the absence of a bilateral obstruction in spite of all of them being malignant lesions is in disagreement with the published data.",cancer
"Quantitative structure-activity relationships for organophosphates binding to trypsin and chymotrypsin. Organophosphate (OP) nerve agents such as sarin, soman, tabun, and O-ethyl S-[2-(diisopropylamino) ethyl] methylphosphonothioate (VX) do not react solely with acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Evidence suggests that cholinergic-independent pathways over a wide range are also targeted, including serine proteases. These proteases comprise nearly one-third of all known proteases and play major roles in synaptic plasticity, learning, memory, neuroprotection, wound healing, cell signaling, inflammation, blood coagulation, and protein processing. Inhibition of these proteases by OP was found to exert a wide range of noncholinergic effects depending on the type of OP, the dose, and the duration of exposure. Consequently, in order to understand these differences, in silico biologically based dose-response and quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) methodologies need to be integrated. Here, QSAR were used to predict OP bimolecular rate constants for trypsin and alpha-chymotrypsin. A heuristic regression of over 500 topological/constitutional, geometric, thermodynamic, electrostatic, and quantum mechanical descriptors, using the software Ampac 8.0 and Codessa 2.51 (SemiChem, Inc., Shawnee, KS), was developed to obtain statistically verified equations for the models. General models, using all data subsets, resulted in R(2) values of .94 and .92 and leave-one-out Q(2) values of 0.9 and 0.87 for trypsin and alpha-chymotrypsin. To validate the general model, training sets were split into independent subsets for test set evaluation. A y-randomization procedure, used to estimate chance correlation, was performed 10,000 times, resulting in mean R(2) values of .24 and .3 for trypsin and alpha-chymotrypsin. The results show that these models are highly predictive and capable of delineating the complex mechanism of action between OP and serine proteases, and ultimately, by applying this approach to other OP enzyme reactions such as AChE, facilitate the development of biologically based dose-response models.",nocancer
"Specific nail alterations in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma: successful treatment with topical mechlorethamine. BACKGROUND: Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma can be associated with clinically significant nail alterations, the presentation of which can be protean and misleading. To date, only a few reports have demonstrated direct specific tumor infiltration of the nail bed, while little is known about the efficacy of topical treatments. OBSERVATIONS: We describe the case of a 93-year-old man presenting with Sezary syndrome who developed clinically significant nail alterations. Light microscopy studies and T-cell receptor rearrangement analysis demonstrated the presence of a specific lymphocytic infiltrate within the nail bed. The patient was given repeated courses of topical mechlorethamine, leading to a sustained complete remission of both skin and nail alterations. CONCLUSIONS: Specific nail involvement should be recognized and considered in all patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. Topical mechlorethamine remains an attractive therapeutic option in cases of specific nail alterations, especially for situations in which systemic therapies are either not indicated or unlikely to be well tolerated.",cancer
"Effects of B vitamins and omega 3 fatty acids on cardiovascular diseases: a randomised placebo controlled trial. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether dietary supplementation with B vitamins or omega 3 fatty acids, or both, could prevent major cardiovascular events in patients with a history of ischaemic heart disease or stroke. DESIGN: Double blind, randomised, placebo controlled trial; factorial design. SETTING: Recruitment throughout France via a network of 417 cardiologists, neurologists, and other physicians. PARTICIPANTS: 2501 patients with a history of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or ischaemic stroke. INTERVENTION: Daily dietary supplement containing 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (560 mug), vitamin B-6 (3 mg), and vitamin B-12 (20 mug) or placebo; and containing omega 3 fatty acids (600 mg of eicosapentanoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid at a ratio of 2:1) or placebo. Median duration of supplementation was 4.7 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Major cardiovascular events, defined as a composite of non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular disease. RESULTS: Allocation to B vitamins lowered plasma homocysteine concentrations by 19% compared with placebo, but had no significant effects on major vascular events (75 v 82 patients, hazard ratio, 0.90 (95% confidence interval 0.66 to 1.23, P=0.50)). Allocation to omega 3 fatty acids increased plasma concentrations of omega 3 fatty acids by 37% compared with placebo, but also had no significant effect on major vascular events (81 v 76 patients, hazard ratio 1.08 (0.79 to 1.47, P=0.64)). CONCLUSION: This study does not support the routine use of dietary supplements containing B vitamins or omega 3 fatty acids for prevention of cardiovascular disease in people with a history of ischaemic heart disease or ischaemic stroke, at least when supplementation is introduced after the acute phase of the initial event.

"Risk factors for invasive breast cancer when core needle biopsy shows ductal carcinoma in situ. HYPOTHESIS: A core needle biopsy (CNB) diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) may be associated with a final diagnosis of invasive cancer. Preoperative radiologic, clinical, and pathological features may identify patients at high risk of diagnostic upstaging, who may be appropriate candidates for sentinel node biopsy at initial surgery. DESIGN: Review of prospectively collected database. SETTING: Tertiary teaching referral hospital and a population-based breast screening center. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients from January 1, 1994, to December 31, 2006, whose CNB findings showed DCIS or DCIS with microinvasion. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Upstaging to invasive cancer. RESULTS: Eleven of 15 cases of DCIS with microinvasion (73.3%) and 65 of 375 cases of DCIS (17.3%) were upstaged to invasive cancer. Ten of 21 palpable lesions (47.6%) were found to have microinvasion. For impalpable DCIS, multivariate analysis showed that noncalcific mammographic features (mass, architectural distortion, or nonspecific density) (odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 2.00 [1.02-3.94]), mammographic size of 20 mm or greater (2.80 [1.46-5.38]), and prolonged screening interval of 3 years or longer (4.41 [1.60-12.13]) were associated with upstaging. The DCIS grade on CNB was significant on univariate analysis (P = .04). The rate of upstaging increased with the number of significant factors present in a patient: 8.3% in patients with no risk factors, 20.8% in those with 1 risk factor, 39.6% in those with 2 risk factors, and 57.1% in those with 3 risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of upstaging can be estimated by using preoperative features in patients with DCIS on CNB. We propose a management algorithm that includes sentinel node biopsy for patients with DCIS who have microinvasion on CNB, palpable DCIS, 2 or more predictive factors, and planned total mastectomy.",cancer

"Health care use and decision making among lower-income families in high-deductible health plans. BACKGROUND: Lower-income families may face unique challenges in high-deductible health plans (HDHPs). METHODS: We administered a cross-sectional survey to a stratified random sample of families in a New England health plan's HDHP with at least $500 in annualized out-of-pocket expenditures. Lower-income families were defined as having incomes that were less than 300% of the federal poverty level. Primary outcomes were cost-related delayed or foregone care, difficulty understanding plans, unexpected costs, information-seeking, and likelihood of families asking their physician about hypothetical recommended services subject to the plan deductible. Multivariate logistic regression was used to control for potential confounders of associations between income group and primary outcomes. RESULTS: Lower-income families (n = 141) were more likely than higher-income families (n = 273) to report cost-related delayed or foregone care (57% vs 42%; adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-2.83]). There were no differences in plan understanding, unexpected costs, or information-seeking by income. Lower-income families were more likely than others to say they would ask their physician about a $100 blood test (79% vs 63%; AOR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.18-3.28) or a $1000 screening colonoscopy (89% vs 80%; AOR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.06-3.93) subject to the plan deductible. CONCLUSIONS: Lower-income families with out-of-pocket expenditures in an HDHP were more likely than higher-income families to report cost-related delayed or foregone care but did not report more difficulty understanding or using their plans, and might be more likely to question services requiring out-of-pocket expenditures. Policymakers and physicians should consider focused monitoring and benefit design modifications to support lower-income families in HDHPs.",nocancer
"Cutaneous marginal zone lymphomas have distinctive features and include 2 subsets. Cutaneous marginal zone lymphomas (CMZL) were segregated in the WHO/EORTC consensus classification but grouped with other MALT lymphomas in the subsequent WHO classification. It has been suggested, however, that CMZL have distinctive features and might include 2 subsets. To address these issues, the clinicopathologic, phenotypic and, when possible, genotypic features of 29 CMZL with plasmacytic differentiation were assessed. The monotypic plasma cells had class-switched heavy chain expression in 22 cases, technically inadequate staining in 1 case (included with class-switched cases for analysis) and 6 were IgM. The class-switched cases had a predominance of T cells in 22 out of 23 cases with a CD4:CD8>1 in 15 out of 16 cases, usually showed nodules and scattered small B cells often with IgD apparently nonneoplastic follicles, lacked CXCR3 B-cell expression, never showed a totally diffuse growth pattern, often had prominent mast cells, and lacked known extracutaneous involvement. The IgM cases showed a predominance of B cells in 5 out of 6 (P=0.0003), a diffuse proliferation of CD20 B cells in all (P<0.0001), CXCR3+ B cells in 2 out of 5 (P<0.04), and extracutaneous disease in 3 out of 6 (P<0.008). CD21 usually disrupted follicular dendritic meshworks were seen in 9 out of 12 class-switched and 5 out of 5 IgM cases. CD123 plasmacytoid dendritic cells, PD1+ T follicular helper cells, CD25 or FOXP3+ regulatory T cells, and TIA1/granzyme B cytotoxic cells were never numerous. Only 1 out of 14 tested cases showed a low-level clonal/oligoclonal T cell receptor gamma gene rearrangement. These findings support the presence of 2 types of cutaneous MALT lymphomas with the class-switched cases being the most distinctive but still sharing significant features with MALT lymphomas from other sites, specifically an extranodal extramedullary CD5-, CD10- indolent small B cell lymphoma with plasmacytic differentiation, frequent benign follicular structures, and not fulfilling the criteria for any other well-defined lymphoma.",cancer
"Anesthesia-related complications of caesarean delivery in Thailand: 16,697 cases from the Thai Anaesthesia Incidents Study. BACKGROUND: Maternal complications related to anesthesia are low in comparison with the results from obstetric factors in developing countries. The purposes of the present study were to determine the incidence of maternal mortality related to anesthesia, to analyze the causes and to suggest measures to improve anesthetic safety for the parturients. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The present study was part of a multi-center study conducted by the Royal College of Anesthesiologists of Thailand aimed at surveillance of anesthesia-related complications in Thailand. The authors conducted a prospective survey of hospital records from all of the cases in and outside the operating room receiving general anesthesia in 18 centers between March 1, 2003 and February 28, 2004. All the forms were checked and verified by three-peer review then included in the analysis, using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Sixteen thousand six hundred ninety seven cases were included. The incidence of anesthetic complication in parturients was 35.9: 10,000 (95% CI 27.4, 46.1). Incidence ofthe four most common anesthetic related adverse events in caesarean section were desaturation 13.8 (95% CI 8.7, 20.7), cardiac arrest 10.2 (95% CI 5.9, 16.3), awareness 6.6 (95% CI 3.3, 11.8), and death related anesthesia 4.8 (95% CI 2.17, 9.4). Of these, seven (17.5%) had preeclampsia/eclampsia and 46 (76.7%) presented for emergency caesarean delivery. General anesthesia was used in 41 patients (68.4%) and spinal in eighteen (30%). There were eight maternal deaths including five with general anesthesia, giving a case fatality rate of 0.1% of general anesthetics or 0.3% of caesarean deliveries. CONCLUSION: The authors found that inexperience, inadequate knowledge, inadequate care, and patient conditions were the major contributory factors. Most of them were preventable and correctable. Additional training and quality assurance can improve and prevent these serious adverse events.",nocancer
"Inhibition of BCL-2 in small cell lung cancer cell lines with oblimersen, an antisense BCL-2 oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN): in vitro and in vivo enhancement of radiation response. BACKGROUND: Oblimersen, an ODN targeting BCL-2 RNA, has been shown to be effective in reducing BCL-2 expression in vitro and in in vivo models engineered to overexpress BCL-2. The present study evaluated the efficacy of combining BCL-2 ODN and radiation in small-cell lung cancers (SCLC) cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The in vitro effect was determined using short term (cell viability) and long term (clonogenic) assays. Apoptosis, BCL-2 expression and intratumoural uptake of the FAM-ODN with or without prior radiation treatment were also evaluated. Combination of ODN and RT was also assessed in vivo. RESULTS: Radiation was shown to increase intracellular and intratumoural penetration of oblimersen, confirming previous results obtained in prostate cancer xenograft models. Oblimersen decreased BCL-2 protein expression in vitro and in vivo. BCL-2 ODN sensitised H69 cells to radiation in vitro and in vivo. Oblimersen increased radiation-induced apoptosis and decreased in vivo tumoural vascularisation. CONCLUSION: Oblimersen was shown to increase in vitro and in vivo effect of RT on SCLC cell lines. Radiation increases intracellular and intratumoural penetration of ODN. This pre-clinical study argues in favour of clinical development in localised SCLC.",cancer
"Conjugation is essential for the anticholestatic effect of NorUrsodeoxycholic acid in taurolithocholic acid-induced cholestasis in rat liver. NorUDCA (24-norursodeoxycholic acid), the C(2)(3)-homolog of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), showed remarkable therapeutic effects in cholestatic Mdr2 (Abcb4) (multidrug resistance protein 2/ATP-binding cassette b4) knockout mice with sclerosing/fibrosing cholangitis. In contrast to UDCA, norUDCA is inefficiently conjugated in human and rodent liver, and conjugation has been discussed as a key step for the anticholestatic action of UDCA in cholestasis. We compared the choleretic, anticholestatic, and antiapoptotic properties of unconjugated and taurine-conjugated UDCA (C(2)(4)) and norUDCA (C(2)(3)) in isolated perfused rat liver (IPRL) and in natrium/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (Ntcp)-transfected human hepatoma (HepG2) cells. Taurolithocholic acid (TLCA) was used to induce a predominantly hepatocellular cholestasis in IPRL. Bile flow was determined gravimetrically; bile acids determined by gas chromatography and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry; the Mrp2 model substrate, 2,4-dinitrophenyl-S-glutathione (GS-DNP) was determined spectrophotometrically; and apoptosis was determined immunocytochemically. The choleretic effect of C(2)(3)-bile acids was comparable to their C(2)(4)-homologs in IPRL. In contrast, TnorUDCA, but not norUDCA antagonized the cholestatic effect of TLCA. Bile flow (percent of controls) was 8% with TLCA-induced cholestasis, and unchanged by coinfusion of norUDCA (14%). However, it was increased by TnorUDCA (83%), UDCA (73%) and TUDCA (136%). Secretion of GS-DNP was markedly reduced by TLCA (5%), unimproved by norUDCA (4%) or UDCA (17%), but was improved modestly by TnorUDCA (26%) or TUDCA (58%). No apoptosis was observed in IPRL exposed to low micromolar TLCA, but equivalent antiapoptotic effects of TUDCA and TnorUDCA were observed in Ntcp-HepG2 cells exposed to TLCA. CONCLUSION: Conjugation is essential for the anticholestatic effect of norUDCA in a model of hepatocellular cholestasis. Combined therapy with UDCA and norUDCA may be superior to UDCA or norUDCA monotherapy in biliary disorders in which hepatocyte as well as cholangiocyte dysfunction contribute to disease progression.",cancer
"Gastrosplenic fistula: etiologies, diagnostic studies, and surgical management. A gastrosplenic fistula is a rare event. Reported causes include a spontaneous malignant fistula, chemotherapy for gastric or splenic malignancies, peptic ulcer disease, Crohn disease, and trauma. We report a case of a gastrosplenic fistula discovered on abdominal computed tomography with contrast, performed in a patient with a history suspicious for malignancy. In this case, no etiology was identified prior to the surgical repair of the lesion despite extensive workup. Due to continued gastrointestinal blood loss requiring multiple transfusions, the patient was taken to surgery for splenectomy and partial gastrectomy. It was at that time that the diagnosis of a large B-cell lymphoma was made. Postoperative chemotherapy was initiated and led to remission of the malignancy. Though most cases require definitive surgical repair, the treatment plans for gastrosplenic fistulas depend largely on the etiology of the lesion.",cancer
"Recurrent multiple cardiac myxomas. BACKGROUND: The recurrence of cardiac myxoma after a surgical excision is a rare condition. The mechanism responsible for the recurrence remains unclear. Multifocal growth of a benign myxoma or malignant transformation, inadequate resection, intraoperative implantation or embolization, familial disposition, and the abnormal DNA ploidy pattern play an important role in development of recurrent myxoma. CASE: We report the case of a 24-year-old female with recurrent multiple cardiac myxomas. She had an abortus 2 months ago. The patient had undergone a resection of left atrial and right ventricular myxoma with extension to the right pulmonary artery 8 years ago. The preoperative echocardiographic examinations revealed recurrent left atrial and right and left ventricular myxomas. The patient underwent a redo-surgery and, in addition to a large myxoma in the right ventricle with involvement of the tricuspid valve and anterior papillary muscle, three myxomas including both myxomas originating at the top and the base of the posterior papillary muscle, respectively, the other myxoma between both papillary muscles in the posterior wall of the left ventricle, and 2 more small myxomas including 1 in the interatrial septum and the other on atrial surface of anterior mitral annulus were found in the left ventricle and atrium. The myxomas were successfully excised through a transmitral approach with a combined bi-atrial incision. The tricuspid valve and mitral valve were repaired with annuloplasty. She had an uneventful postoperative course and no residual myxoma was found by echocardiography. CONCLUSION: We think that a long-term follow-up by echocardiography in all patients after the resection of myxoma is advised for an early detection of any recurrence (Fig. 5, Ref. 9).",cancer

"In vivo quantification of human serotonin 1A receptor using 11C-CUMI-101, an agonist PET radiotracer. The serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT) type 1A receptor (5-HT(1A)R) is implicated in the pathophysiology of numerous neuropsychiatric disorders. We have published the initial evaluation and reproducibility in vivo of [O-methyl-(11)C]2-(4-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl)butyl)-4-methyl-1,2,4-tri azine-3,5(2H,4H)dione ((11)C-CUMI-101), a novel 5-HT(1A) agonist radiotracer, in Papio anubis. Here, we report the optimal modeling parameters of (11)C-CUMI-101 for human PET studies. METHODS: PET scans were obtained for 7 adult human volunteers. (11)C-CUMI-101 was injected as an intravenous bolus, and emission data were collected for 120 min in 3-dimensional mode. We evaluated 10 different models using metabolite-corrected arterial input functions or reference region approaches and several outcome measures. RESULTS: When using binding potential (BP(F) = B(avail)/K(D) [total available receptor concentration divided by the equilibrium dissociation constant]) as the outcome measure, the likelihood estimation in the graphical analysis (LEGA) model performed slightly better than the other methods evaluated at full scan duration. The average test-retest percentage difference was 9.90% +/- 5.60%. When using BP(ND) (BP(ND) = f(nd) x B(avail)/K(D); BP(ND) equals the product of BP(F) and f(nd) [free fraction in the nondisplaceable compartment]), the simplified reference tissue method (SRTM) achieved the lowest percentage difference and smallest bias when compared with nondisplaceable binding potential obtained from LEGA using the metabolite-corrected plasma input function (r(2) = 0.99; slope = 0.92). The time-stability analysis indicates that a 120-min scan is sufficient for the stable estimation of outcome measures. Voxel results were comparable to region-of-interest-based analysis, with higher spatial resolution. CONCLUSION: On the basis of its measurable and stable free fraction, high affinity and selectivity, good blood-brain barrier permeability, and plasma and brain kinetics, (11)C-CUMI-101 is suitable for the imaging of high-affinity 5-HT(1A) binding in humans.",nocancer
"FoxOs enforce a progression checkpoint to constrain mTORC1-activated renal tumorigenesis. mTORC1 is a validated therapeutic target for renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Here, analysis of Tsc1-deficient (mTORC1 hyperactivation) mice uncovered a FoxO-dependent negative feedback circuit constraining mTORC1-mediated renal tumorigenesis. We document robust FoxO activation in Tsc1-deficient benign polycystic kidneys and FoxO extinction on progression to murine renal tumors; murine renal tumor progression on genetic deletion of both Tsc1 and FoxOs; and downregulated FoxO expression in most human renal clear cell and papillary carcinomas, yet continued expression in less aggressive RCCs and benign renal tumor subtypes. Mechanistically, integrated analyses revealed that FoxO-mediated block operates via suppression of Myc through upregulation of the Myc antagonists, Mxi1-SRalpha and mir-145, establishing a FoxO-Mxi1-SRalpha/mir-145 axis as a major progression block in renal tumor development.",cancer
"A behavioral and systems view of professionalism. Professionalism may not be sufficient to drive the profound and far-reaching changes needed in the US health care system, but without it, the health care enterprise is lost. Formal statements defining professionalism have been abstract and principle based, without a clear description of what professional behaviors look like in practice. This article proposes a behavioral and systems view of professionalism that provides a practical approach for physicians and the organizations in which they work. A more behaviorally oriented definition makes the pursuit of professionalism in daily practice more accessible and attainable. Professionalism needs to evolve from being conceptualized as an innate character trait or virtue to sophisticated competencies that can and must be taught and refined over a lifetime of practice. Furthermore, professional behaviors are profoundly influenced by the organizational and environmental context of contemporary medical practice, and these external forces need to be harnessed to support--not inhibit--professionalism in practice. This perspective on professionalism provides an opportunity to improve the delivery of health care through education and system-level reform.",nocancer
"Medullary thyroid carcinoma, small cell variant, as a diagnostic challenge on fine needle aspiration: a case report. BACKGROUND: The small cell variant of medullary thyroid carcinoma (SCV-MTC) is a very unusual tumor that carries a poor prognosis. This tumor type closely resembles small cell pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinoma or lymphoma. CASE: A 43-year-old woman had a palpable mass on the right side of her neck. A fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) revealed a hypercellular lesion composed mainly of isolated, small, round cells with salt-and-pepper chromatin interspersed with inconspicuous deposits of fluffy acellular material. A diagnosis of ""malignant tumor, consistent with small cell carcinoma, metastasis not excluded"" was rendered during the on-site rapid cytologic examination. Immunostaining showed a few isolated cells reactive for calcitonin, intense and diffuse immunoreactivity for carcinoembryonic antigen, dotlike positivity for chromogranin and cytokeratin, and negativity for thyroglobulin. Congo-red staining was positive in the acellular deposit, consistent with SCV-MTC. Subsequent total thyroidectomy confirmed this diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The wide range of cytomorphologic features of MTC can be misleading on FNAB and can be a diagnostic challenge. Congo-red staining and immunoreactivity for calcitonin can be negative in this variant. Consequently, salt-and-pepper chromatin, Congo-red staining and a panel of antibodies comprising calcitonin, carcinoembryonic antigen, chromogranin, cytokeratin, leukocyte common antigen and thyroglobulin are mandatory for the correct diagnosis.",cancer

"Solid variant of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma in the head and neck region: a case report of a diagnostic dilemma in a head and neck fine needle aspiration clinic. BACKGROUND: Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) is one of the major categories of rhabdomyosarcomas; it encompasses malignant tumors of striated muscle and occurs more frequently in the extremities. It is uncommonly reported in young adults and extremely rarely found in middle-aged and elderly patients. CASE: A 54-year-old man presented to a rapid head and neck clinic with a history of rapid enlargement of neck lumps on the right side of his neck over a period of 5 weeks. The diagnosis of an undifferentiated malignant small round cell tumor was made from cytologic examination of the aspirated sample, and biopsy of the lesion was advised. On histologic analysis, diagnosis of solid variant of ARMS was made. CONCLUSION: A solid variant of ARMS in an older population has not been published in the literature within the settings of a rapid head and neck clinic. Therefore, the remote possibility of this diagnosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a malignant, round cell tumor in fine needle aspiration cytology in an older patient's neck lump.",cancer
"Distribution of HPV genotypes in uterine cervical lesions among the Uighur women in Xinjiang province of China. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of HPV genotypes in uterine cervical lesions of Uighur women in the Xinjiang province of China. METHODS: A total of 223 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded cervical tissue specimens from Uighur patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) were analyzed with HPV specific general primer pairs MY09/11 by PCR amplification and HPV chip. RESULTS: Among 223 cases, HPV-positive samples accounted for 58.7% (131/223). HPV infection rate increased along with the pathological grade of the specimens, with a clear tendency of normal < CIN 1 < CIN 2 < CIN 3 < SCC. HPV16 infection was the predominate one and reached the highest level in SCC with 96%. HPV18 and 58 were detected only in some specimens as a second infection in addition to HPV16. The infection rate and type of HPV was not closely associated with the histological differentiation of the cervical cancer. CONCLUSION: HPV 16 was the most common type detected in Uighur women with SCC and CIN in the Xinjiang area of China. Together with the high infection rate, this may be the reason for the four-fold higher cervical cancer incidence in this province and in this population, when compared to total China. The prevalence of HPV18 and 58 was relatively low.",cancer
"Burden of malignancy after a primary skin cancer: recurrence, multiple skin cancers and second primary cancers. The current paper summarizes relevant recent research on the high risk of recurrence, multiple skin cancers and second primary cancers in the growing number of people with a history of skin cancer; the ultimate purpose is to better assess the burden of malignancy following skin cancer. A number of challenges exist in identifying and tracking both melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) cases. Most jurisdictions do not routinely track NMSC cases and, even if they do, it is customary to only include the first diagnosis. There are variable rules for counting multiple melanoma cancers, and recurrences are not considered for either major type of skin cancer. Applying insights from recent studies of this issue to Canadian cancer statistics would increase reported diagnoses of NMSC by about 26% and melanoma by 10% in this country. This approach to a fuller assessment of the burden of skin cancers has been called a ""diagnosis-based incidence approach"" as compared with a ""patient-based incidence approach"". A further issue that is not usually taken into account when assessing the burden of skin cancers is the 20% to 30% elevated risk of noncutaneous second primary cancers following a primary skin tumour. In summary, individuals with skin cancer are subject to a high risk of recurrence, multiple skin cancers and second primary cancers. This burden should be a special concern in the large and growing pool of individuals with a history of skin cancer, as well as among prevention planners.",cancer
"Phase I/II study of a 3-week cycle of irinotecan and S-1 in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. The combination of an oral fluoropyrimidine derivative, S-1, and irinotecan is expected to be a promising regimen for advanced colorectal cancer. This study was performed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose (RD) of irinotecan combined with S-1 in a 3-week cycle regimen and to observe the safety and efficacy for patients with previously untreated advanced colorectal cancer. Eighty milligrams per m(2) of S-1 was given orally for 14 consecutive days and escalated doses of irinotecan were administered on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks in the phase I trial. Forty patients were treated at the RD during the phase II trial. Forty-three patients were enrolled between February 2005 and March 2007. The dose-limiting toxicity was diarrhea and abdominal pain. The MTD of irinotecan was 100 mg/m(2) and the RD was determined to be 80 mg/m(2) of irinotecan combined with 80 mg/m(2) of S-1. The phase II trial showed that 22 of 40 patients achieved a complete or partial response and eight had stable disease. The overall response rate was 55.0%. The median progression-free survival time and median survival time were 6.7 and 21 months, respectively. There were no treatment-related deaths. The main toxicities were leukopenia, neutropenia, anorexia and diarrhea. This study suggests the combination of irinotecan and S-1 repeated every 3 weeks is tolerable and effective for patients with previously untreated advanced colorectal cancer.",cancer
"An aortic ring: from physiologic reconstruction of the root to a standardized approach for aortic valve repair. OBJECTIVE: We suggest standardizing aortic valve repair using a physiologic approach by associating root remodeling with resuspension of the cusp effective height and external subvalvular aortic ring annuloplasty. METHODS: A total of 187 patients underwent remodeling associated with subvalvular aortic ring annuloplasty (14 centers, 24 surgeons). Three strategies for cusp repair were evaluated: group 1, gross visual estimation (74 patients); group 2, alignment of cusp free edges (62 patients); and group 3, 2-step approach, alignment of the cusp free edges and effective height resuspension (51 patients). The composite outcome was defined as recurrence of aortic insufficiency of grade 2 or greater and/or reoperation. RESULTS: The operative mortality rate was 3.2% (n = 6). Treatment of a cusp lesion was most frequently performed in group 3 (70.6% vs 20.3% in group 1 and 30.6% in group 2, P < .001). Nine patients required reoperation during a follow-up period of 24 months (range, 12-45), 6 patients in group 1 and 3 patients in group 2. At 1 year, no patients in group 3 presented with composite outcome events compared with 28.1% in group 1 and 15% in group 2 (P < .001). Residual aortic insufficiency and tricuspid anatomy were independent risk factors for the composite outcome in groups 1 and 2. The annulus diameter, the presence of Marfan syndrome, and cusp repair had no effect on aortic insufficiency recurrence or reoperation. CONCLUSIONS: A standardized and physiologic approach to aortic valve repair, considering both the aorta (root remodeling) and the valve (resuspension of the cusp effective height and subvalvular ring annuloplasty) improved the preliminary results and might affect their long-term durability. The ongoing Conservative Aortic Valve Surgery for Aortic Insufficiency and Aneurysm of the Aortic Root (CAVIAAR) trial will compare this strategy to mechanical valve replacement.",nocancer
"Orthotopic fluorescent peritoneal carcinomatosis model of esophageal cancer. Aim: Orthotopic models utilizing orthotopic implantation have been used for developing cancer models of multiple tumor entities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of orthotopic injection in establishing a model of esophageal cancer using a human green fluorescent protein (GFP) cell line of human esophageal carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nude mice were orthotopically injected in the abdominal esophagus with stably transfected GFP-PT1590 cells. Tumor progression was examined by fluorescence imaging. RESULTS: Fifty percent of animals developed extensive peritoneal spread without a distinct primary tumor at the injection site. Continuous and metastatic spread to the liver, lungs, and lymph nodes was also observed. Fluorescence imaging enabled fast and specific visualization of tumor progression without the need for anesthesia. Intraperitoneal and metastatic tumor spread of GFP-PT1590 esophageal carcinoma demonstrated a highly aggressive but heterogeneous behaviour. Although injection of the esophageal carcinoma cell line GFP-PT1590 did not lead to primary esophageal tumor development at the site of injection, 50% of the mice developed extensive peritoneal spread, as well as lymph node and organ metastasis. CONCLUSION: The orthotopic cell injection model resulted in peritoneal carcinomatosis of esophageal adenocarcinoma, which could be visualized in real time using fluorescence imaging.",cancer
"Sequelae of prospective versus retrospective reports of adverse childhood experiences. Retrospective assessment of adverse childhood experiences is widely used in research, although there are concerns about its validity. In particular, recall bias is assumed to produce significant artifacts. Data from a longitudinal cohort (the British National Child Development Study; N=7710) and the retrospective Mainz Adverse Childhood Experiences Study (N=1062, Germany) were compared on 10 adverse childhood experiences and psychological adjustment at age 42 yr. Between the two methods, no significant differences in risk effects were detected. Results held for bivariate analyses on all 10 childhood adversities and a multivariate model; the latter comprises the childhood adversities which show significant long-term sequelae (not always with natural parent, chronically ill parent, financial hardship, and being firstborn) and three covariates. In conclusion, the present data did not show any bias in the retrospective assessment.",nocancer
"Quality of life among persons living with HIV infection in Ibadan, Nigeria. HIV infection is a major factor in the deteriorating. quality of life particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Currently, the HIV prevalence in Nigeria is 4.4% with wide variation across the states. Though much data exist on the socio-economic aspects of HIV/ AIDS, information on quality of life of People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) is still scanty. Therefore, this study focused on socio-psychological investigation of the quality of life of PLWHAs in Ibadan, Nigeria. The study adopted the survey research design and was conducted in three care support centres in Ibadan. Using systematic random sampling technique, 514 PLWHAs were selected. A triangulation of methods was employed using pre-tested structured questionnaire, fifteen Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and six in-.depth interviews. The Health Belief Model complemented with the Quality of Life Tree guided the investigation. Quality Of Life was measured using the ""HIV Symptom Scale"" (HSS) and the ""Quality Of Life Scale"" (QOLS). Frequency distribution, percentages and chi-square were used to analyze quantitative data while content analysis was employed for qualitative data. The ages of the participants ranged from 15 -60 years with a mean of 34.8 (S.D 8.2). Sex distribution shows female preponderance with male: female ratio of 1:2. The data revealed poor quality of life among PLWHAs. There is no significant relationship between age and quality of life (P > 0.05). Almost equal proportion of participants aged 15 - 34 years (50.3%) and 35 -60 years (49.7%) showed similar quality of life as indicated by emotional status, life satisfaction and level of coping with the infection. Majority (70.0%) considered their poor financial condition a barrier to treatment. Qualitative data showed stigmatization and discrimination against PLWHAs by family and community members regardless of age and gender. This stimulated a deep feeling of sadness, dejection, hopelessness, anxiety and fear thereby affecting negatively their quality of life. However, majority of the participants (67.3%) coped with the infection through life style adjustment (dedicating more time to religious activities and resorting to spiritual help, self coping mechanism of trying not to think about the problem) and psychosocial support from nongovernmental organization support groups and faith-based organizations. Poor financial status of majority of PLWHA in Ibadan restricted their access to treatment and other care and services. Discrimination towards them by family, friends and the community affected negatively their quality of life. A combination of strategies--health education, psycho--social interventions is needed in addressing the needs of people living with HIV/AIDS.",nocancer

"Coordinating medical civil military operations in Multinational Division-North. Medical civil military operations (MCMO) are part of military civil capacity-building efforts within the full spectrum of military operations, from war to military operations other than war. In 2008-2009 during Operation Iraqi Freedom, the Division Surgeon's Section (DSS) of the 25th Infantry Division (25ID) and Multinational Division-North developed an innovative MCMO program in northern Iraq. The program centered on understanding and mapping key relationships, empowering brigade-level programs, and leveraging technology to identify and share best practices. The DSS mapped the critical relationships within and between the three entities affecting MCMO: the government of Iraq (GOI), Department of State (DOS), and the Department of Defense (DOD). A division MCMO working group was then created along with processes to facilitate MCMO project execution and program management. The structure and organization of the 25ID MCMO program lend themselves to other operational environments requiring synchronization of medical capacity-building efforts.",nocancer
"Simple and rapid RP-HPLC method for simultaneous determination of acyclovir and zidovudine in human plasma. Combination therapy with acyclovir and zidovudine is used for the treatment of herpes-infected immunocompromised patients. In the view of the optimal drug concentrations (minimum effective concentrations) for viral suppression and avoidance of drug toxicity, monitoring of drug levels has been considered essential to determine drug concentrations in plasma after administration of a dose of acyclovir and zidovudine. A simple, precise, and rapid RP-HPLC method has been developed for this purpose. Chromatographic separation was performed using methanol-water (50 + 50, v/v), pH 2.5 adjusted with orthophosphoric acid, as an isocratic mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min with an Inertsil ODS (C18) column (5 microm particle size, 250 x 4.60 mm id). Detection was carried out using a UV photo diode array detector at 258 nm. The plasma samples were prepared by a protein precipitation method. The retention time for acyclovir and zidovudine was 3.5 +/- 0.2 and 6.2 +/- 0.3 min, respectively. The method was linear in the range of 200-1800 and 400-3600 ng/mL with LOQ of 200 ng (SD = +/-1.4) and 400 ng (SD = +/-0.9) for zidovudine and acyclovir, respectively, in plasma. The mean accuracy was 98.0 and 96.4%, with average extraction recovery of 64.8 +/- 2.1 and 77.5 +/- 1.7% for lower nominal concentrations of acyclovir and zidovudine, respectively.",nocancer
"Relationship between thymidylate synthase (TYMS) gene polymorphism and TYMS protein levels in patients with high-risk breast cancer. The thymidylate synthase gene (TYMS) has three functional polymorphisms which are associated with TYMS expression. To explore the predictability of TYMS polymorphisms for the sensitivity and toxicity of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in breast cancer patients, this study investigated the association between TYMS polymorphisms and TYMS protein expression in normal and tumour tissue specimens from 49 lymph node-positive breast cancer patients. An analysis of the TYMS 3'-UTR polymorphism showed that level of TYMS protein in normal tissue with the +6 bp/+6 bp genotype was significantly higher than that for the -6 bp/+6 bp genotype. Tumour tissue with the +6 bp/+6 bp genotype had a significantly higher TYMS protein expression than did those with other genotypes. These findings suggest that breast cancer patients with the TYMS 3'-UTR +6 bp/+6 bp polymorphism whose tumours show a 6 bp deletion within TYMS 3'-UTR represent a group that may derive the most benefit from 5-FU chemotherapy.",cancer

"Prognostic assessments of medical therapy and vestibular testing in post-traumatic migraine-associated dizziness patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to characterize our clinical population of patients suffering with post-traumatic migraine-associated dizziness (PTMAD) and determine any associations with medical interventions and vestibular testing metrics to help predict response to treatments. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The electronic medical records of 83 patients presenting to a tertiary referral center who were given a diagnosis of PTMAD and who had been treated were retrospectively reviewed. General characteristics, clinical treatment, pre- and post-vestibular therapy testing metrics, and success and failure outcomes were assessed. Patients were assigned into responder and nonresponder groups related to their headaches and evaluated at two specific time points. Medication failures and vestibular test metrics were compared to identify and predict clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Seventy-two of 82 patients (88%) were analyzed at two time points. Use of verapamil, topiramate, gabapentin, amitryptiline, and valproic acid showed no comparative treatment benefit in responders compared to nonresponders (P = 0.294). Findings associated with successful treatments include response to initial medication (P = 0.001), final dynamic gait index (DGI) scores (P = 0.029), final vertical dynamic visual acuity test (DVAT) scores (up, 0.007; down, 0.006), and both final and change in computerized dynamic posturography-sensory organization test (CDP-SOT) scores (P = 0.001, P = 0.032). The antipsychotic quetiapine was specifically associated with outcome failures (P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Specific prophylactic antimigraine medications were not associated with improved outcomes in PTMAD patients. Initial clinical responses and vestibular test metrics may guide physicians to predict successful outcomes.",nocancer

"Screening history in women with cervical cancer in a Danish population-based screening program. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the screening histories of all cervical cancers in a Danish screening population. The intention was to decide suboptimal sides of the screening program and to evaluate the significance of routine screening in the development of cervical cancer. METHODS: The study describes the results of a quality control audit, performed on all new cervical cancer cases diagnosed in the years 2008-2009 at two major Danish screening-centers. All relevant cytological and histological cervical samples were reviewed. RESULTS: 202.534 cytological samples were evaluated in the study period, while 112 women were diagnosed with cervical cancer. The histological diagnoses comprised: 62 (55.4%) squamous cell carcinomas, 20 (17.9%) microinvasive squamous cell carcinomas, 25 (22.3%) adenocarcinomas and 5 cancers of different histology. The mean age of study subjects was 46.6 years. 51 (45.5%) women had deficient screening histories, while 45 (40.2%) women had followed the screening recommendations and had normal cervical samples in review. 11 (9.8%) women were diagnosed with false negative cytology, 2 women had false negative histological tests, while pathological review was not feasible for 3 subjects. CONCLUSIONS: More than 45% of the cervical cancer cases in our study were due to deficient cervical screening, stressing the importance of increasing the screening-uptake and coverage. 40% interval cancers emphasize the relevance of further cervical testing of women with relevant symptoms, despite of prior normal cervical samples. Finally, 9.8% false negative cytological samples are consistent with previous reports, but still a part of the screening program that should be improved.",cancer

"Adoption of motivational interviewing and motivational enhancement therapy following clinical trials. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Clinical Trials Network (CTN) is designed to test drug abuse treatment interventions in multisite clinical trials and to support the translation of effective interventions into practice. In this study, qualitative methods were applied to examine adoption of motivational interviewing and motivational enhancement therapy (MI/MET) in five clinics where these interventions were tested. Participants were clinic staff (n=17) who were interviewed about the MI/MET study, and about whether MI/MET was adopted after the study ended. Although clinics' participation in a clinical trial includes many elements thought to be necessary for later adoption of the intervention, we found that there was ""adoption"" in one clinic, ""partial adoption"" in one clinic, ""counselor adoption"" in one clinic, and ""no adoption"" in two clinics. These findings highlight a distinction between adoption at the organizational and counselor levels, and suggest that a range of adoption outcomes may be observed in the field. Findings are relevant to clinical staff, program directors, administrators and policy makers concerned with improvement of drug abuse treatment systems through adoption of evidence-based practices.",nocancer
"Atlanto-occipital fusion: an osteological study with clinical implications. BACKGROUND: Atlanto-occipital fusion may be symptomatic or asymptomatic in nature. The anomaly may be incidentally detected at autopsies or during routine cadaveric dissections. The fusion of the atlas with occipital bone may result in the compression of vertebral artery and first cervical nerve. METHODS: A total of 55 dried occipital bones in the Department of Anatomy, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) and Department of Anatomy, Universiti Malaya (UM) were included in the study. The presence of atlantooccipital fusion was closely observed and morphometric measurements were taken. RESULTS: Out of 55 dried occipital bones studied, we observed atlanto-occiptalization in two bones (3.63 %). A total of 53 occipital bones (96.37 %) did not exhibit any anomalous fusions. Out of the two anomalous atlanto-occiptal fusions, one was complete while the other had unilateral right-sided fusion of the atlas with the occipital bone. CONCLUSION: Atlanto-occipitalization may result in the compression of vertebral artery thereby influencing the blood flow to the brain. Atlanto-occipitalization may also result in compression of the first cervical nerve. The action of the postural muscles on the extensor surface may be affected as a result of this anomaly. The present article discusses the clinical implications of atlanto-occipitalization, which may be beneficial for neurosurgeons, neurologists and radiologists in day-to-day clinical practice (Fig. 3, Ref. 17).",nocancer
"The control of the metabolic switch in cancers by oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Cells from some tumors use an altered metabolic pattern compared with that of normal differentiated adult cells in the body. Tumor cells take up much more glucose and mainly process it through aerobic glycolysis, producing large quantities of secreted lactate with a lower use of oxidative phosphorylation that would generate more adenosine triphosphate (ATP), water, and carbon dioxide. This is the Warburg effect, which provides substrates for cell growth and division and free energy (ATP) from enhanced glucose use. This metabolic switch places the emphasis on producing intermediates for cell growth and division, and it is regulated by both oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in a number of key cancer-producing pathways. Blocking these metabolic pathways or restoring these altered pathways could lead to a new approach in cancer treatments.",cancer
"Clinical operational tolerance after renal transplantation: current status and future challenges. In solid organ transplantation, the achievement of an immunosuppression (IS)-free state [also referred to as clinical operational tolerance (COT)] represents the ultimate goal. Although COT is feasible and safe in selected cases after liver transplantation, it is an exceptional finding after other types of solid organ transplantation. In the field of renal transplantation (RT), approximately 100 cases of COT have been reported to date, mainly in patients who were not compliant with their immunosuppressive regimens or in individuals who had previously received a bone marrow transplant for hematological disorders. On the basis of promising results obtained in animal models, several tolerogenic protocols have been attempted in humans, but most have failed to achieve robust and stable COT after RT. Molecule-based regimens have been largely ineffective, whereas cell-based regimens have provided some encouraging results. In these latter regimens, apart from standard IS, patients usually receive perioperative infusion of donor bone marrow-derived stem cells, which are able to interact with the immune cells of the host and mitigate their response to engraftment. Unfortunately, most renal transplant patients who developed acute rejection-occurring either during the weaning protocol or after complete withdrawal of IS-eventually lost their grafts. Currently, the immune monitoring necessary for predicting the presence and persistence of donor-specific unresponsiveness is not available. Overall, the present review will provide a conceptual framework for COT and conclude that stable and robust COT after RT remains an elusive goal and that the different strategies attempted to date are not yet reproducibly safe or effective.",nocancer
"Reimbursement policy and androgen-deprivation therapy for prostate cancer. BACKGROUND: The Medicare Modernization Act led to moderate reductions in reimbursement for androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer, starting in 2004 and followed by substantial changes in 2005. We hypothesized that these reductions would lead to decreases in the use of ADT for indications that were not evidence based. METHODS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Medicare database, we identified 54,925 men who received a diagnosis of incident prostate cancer from 2003 through 2005. We divided these men into groups according to the strength of the indication for ADT use. The use of ADT was deemed to be inappropriate as primary therapy for men with localized cancers of a low-to-moderate grade (for whom a survival benefit of such therapy was improbable), appropriate as adjuvant therapy with radiation therapy for men with locally advanced cancers (for whom a survival benefit was established), and discretionary for men receiving either primary or adjuvant therapy for localized but high-grade tumors. The proportion of men receiving ADT was calculated according to the year of diagnosis for each group. We used modified Poisson regression models to calculate the effect of the year of diagnosis on the use of ADT. RESULTS: The rate of inappropriate use of ADT declined substantially during the study period, from 38.7% in 2003 to 30.6% in 2004 to 25.7% in 2005 (odds ratio for ADT use in 2005 vs. 2003, 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65 to 0.79). There was no decrease in the appropriate use of adjuvant ADT (odds ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.19). In cases involving discretionary use, there was a significant decline in use in 2005 but not in 2004. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in the Medicare reimbursement policy in 2004 and 2005 were associated with reductions in ADT use, particularly among men for whom the benefits of such therapy were unclear.

"Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy added to the treatment of ovarian cancer. A review of achieved results and complications. OBJECTIVE: The late revelation of ovarian cancer ensures it as the leading cause of death among gynecologic cancers. Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and intravenous (i.v.) chemotherapy have been the cornerstone for a long time to treat this disease. More recently, the modality of intraperitoneal administration of chemotherapy under hyperthermic conditions (HIPEC) has been added. This review surveys the results of HIPEC added to CRS in ovarian cancer. METHODS: A multi-database search was conducted focusing on mortality, morbidity and overall and disease-free (DF) survival rates. RESULTS: 16 studies were identified reporting the results of CRS followed by HIPEC of 546 patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Postoperative mortality was reported for 14 out of 481 patients in total (2.9%). The major morbidity rate varied between 3.4 and 50.0%. In all but one study (533 patients), 185 events were reported (34.5%) and 21 re-interventions after 476 operations (4.4%). Survival data ranged from 10.0 to 57.1 months for the DF survival and from 19.0 to 76.1 months for the overall survival. Optimal cytoreduction and recurrent disease were associated with a better outcome in selected cases. CONCLUSIONS: Adding HIPEC to the current treatment modalities for ovarian cancer seems to be feasible. Improved survival rates have been reported at the cost of acceptable mortality rates. Nevertheless, there was a selection bias, the morbidity should not be underestimated and it is unclear yet which patient will benefit most from this treatment. Randomized controlled trials will provide an answer to this question.",cancer

"The National Asthma Survey--New York State: association of the home environment with current asthma status. OBJECTIVES: The National Asthma Survey--New York State (NYS), a telephone survey of NYS residents, was conducted in 2002-2003 to further understand the burden of asthma among adults and children and to identify health, socioeconomic, behavioral, and environmental factors associated with asthma. METHODS: A total of 1,412 households with at least one member with current asthma and 2,290 control households answered questions about their home environment (e.g., presence of asthma triggers and practices that promote or reduce common asthma triggers). RESULTS; For children younger than 18 years of age, we found statistically significant positive associations between current asthma and the presence of mold (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3, 3.3), air cleaners (AOR = 1.5, 95% CI 1.1, 2.1), dehumidifiers (AOR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.4, 2.7), and humidifiers (AOR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.1, 2.3). For adults, there were statistically significant positive associations with the presence of mold (AOR = 2.5, 95% CI 1.8, 3.4), air cleaners (AOR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.7, 2.8), and humidifiers (AOR = 1.4, 95% CI 1.1, 1.8). There were no statistically significant associations with the presence of cockroaches, pets, or tobacco smoke, while use of a wood-burning stove or fireplace was significantly more prevalent in control homes. CONCLUSIONS: Asthma guidelines emphasize the importance of reducing triggers in the home as part of a multifaceted approach to asthma control. Despite these guidelines, many asthma triggers (specifically, mold) were as prevalent or more so in the homes of New Yorkers with asthma as compared with control households. Public health interventions in NYS should focus on educating households about potential asthma triggers and their sources and teach methods to prevent, reduce, or eliminate them.",nocancer
Chondroid syringoma: a case report. BACKGROUND: Chondroid syringoma is a benign skin adnexal tumor. The reported incidence of chondroid syringoma among primary skin tumors is low and has been reported at 0.01-0.098%. CASE: A 57-year-old woman presented with a 10-year history of a slowly growing lump on her philtrum. Fine needle aspiration cytology was performed. The smears showed cohesive groups of round cells embedded in a chondromyxoid ground substance. A diagnosis of benign appendageal tumor of the skin was made. Surgical excision of tumor was done. Histopathologic examination was consistent with chondroid syringoma. CONCLUSION: Chondroid syringoma should be included in the differential diagnosis of a slowly growing nodule on the head or neck.

"EGFR-activating mutations are not present in breast tumors of Japanese patients. BACKGROUND: Despite advances in treatment, recurrent breast cancer remains a lethal disease. The epidermal growth factor receptor family has been suggested to play a role in breast cancer. However, no investigations of the frequency of EGFR mutation and the potential role of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) in Japanese patients with breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tumor specimens were collected from 84 breast cancer patients who underwent surgery. Polymerase chain reaction-based methods were used to examine EGFR-activating mutations (exon 19 and 21). RESULTS: Activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR were not identified in any of the tumors. CONCLUSION: EGFR-activating mutations were not present in the Japanese breast cancer series studied here. Therefore, unlike lung cancer, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors are unlikely to provide any benefit for Japanese breast cancer patients.",cancer
"International stem cell tourism and the need for effective regulation. Part II: Developing sound oversight measures and effective patient support. Part I of this article, published in the March 2010 issue of the Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal, traces and addresses the provision of unproven stem cell treatments in Russia and India, examines the concept of innovative treatment, and concludes that stronger regulations are needed to protect the health and informed choices of patients. The current paper, Part II, proposes that the regulatory frameworks for the development of safe and efficacious treatments in effect in the United States and the United Kingdom provide examples of strong oversight measures from which countries seeking to obtain international credibility for their biotechnological competence could draw when developing regulations for stem cell treatments. Major sources of information available to persons who consider receiving such unproven treatments are explored in order to understand and address their concerns.

"Pregnancy-associated breast cancer--a review analysis. The aim of the present review was to assess the relationship between pregnancy and/or lactation and breast cancer, the influence of pregnancy on mortality and prognosis of the disease, the consequences of breast cancer to the current pregnancy and also to discuss the future perspective for women's fertility. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Articles were obtained from Medline (1988 present) using as keywords breast cancer, pregnancy, breastfeeding, lactation, carcinoma and pregnancy. RESULTS: Unfortunately, delays in diagnosis and treatment are common during pregnancy and the prognosis is thus worsened. Nulliparity, early menarche and late age at first pregnancy are associated with increased risk for breast cancer. Breastfeeding confers a protective effect on risk of breast cancer, which appears to be related to the duration of breastfeeding. In cases of advanced metastatic disease during the first 14 to 15 weeks of pregnancy when chemotherapy is necessary for prompt treatment, termination of pregnancy may be proposed, particularly if the patient is ER-positive. Modified radical mastectomy is probably the procedure most frequently used today. In general chemotherapy should be delayed until after 14 to 15 weeks of gestation and radiation should be reserved until post delivery. Several authorities generally advise that future pregnancy should be delayed for at least two years after breast cancer treatment. CONCLUSION: Breast cancer has an equivalent prognosis in pregnant and non pregnant patients when matched by age and stage at diagnosis. Women are invariably best treated by multidisciplinary teams.",cancer
"PET/CT in oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer in post therapy setting. 18F-FDG PET/CT is an immerging tool for follow-up a head and neck cancerpatients. Accurate PET/CT interpretation in a post therapy setting is crucial for proper management. However there are many limitations in post therapy settings. For example, variable degree of normal physiologic uptake is noted. Physiologic processes cannot be identified by symmetrical FDG uptake in a post therapy setting. The present article demonstrates case series including asymmetrical, abnormal, or unusual patterns of FDG uptake within the oral cavity and oropharyngeal structures in both benign and malignant conditions.",cancer
Co-existing tubercular axillary lymphadenitis with carcinoma breast can falsely over-stage the disease--case series. The synchronous occurrence of tuberculosis and carcinoma in breast is unusual. The simultaneous occurrence of both the diseases can complicate the neoplastic disease. The diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis in a patient with cancer assumes importance as it can prevent high mortality in patients with co-existent disease and thereby create problems in treatment decision. Axillary lymph node enlargement in breast cancer patient is not always caused by metastatic tumour of the breast even in the ipsilateral axillary nodes. We present here six case reports as an example of tuberculous axillary lymphadenitis co-existing with invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. Accurate diagnosis has helped in down-staging carcinoma of the breast and also in identifying curable disease.,cancer
"From the connectome to the synaptome: an epic love story. A major challenge in neuroscience is to decipher the structural layout of the brain. The term ""connectome"" has recently been proposed to refer to the highly organized connection matrix of the human brain. However, defining how information flows through such a complex system represents so difficult a task that it seems unlikely it could be achieved in the near future or, for the most pessimistic, perhaps ever. Circuit diagrams of the nervous system can be considered at different levels, although they are surely impossible to complete at the synaptic level. Nevertheless, advances in our capacity to marry macro- and microscopic data may help establish a realistic statistical model that could describe connectivity at the ultrastructural level, the ""synaptome,"" giving us cause for optimism.",nocancer
"Incorporating incretin-based therapies into clinical practice: differences between glucagon-like Peptide 1 receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is a prevalent disorder that affects children, adolescents, and adults worldwide. In addition to risks of microvascular disease, patients with type 2 DM often have multiple risk factors of macrovascular disease; for example, approximately 90% of patients with type 2 DM are overweight/obese. Type 2 DM is a complex disease that involves a variety of pathophysiologic abnormalities, including insulin resistance, increased hepatic glucose production, and abnormalities in the secretion of hormones, such as insulin, glucagon, amylin, and incretins. Incretins are gut-derived peptides with a variety of glucoregulatory functions. Incretin dysfunction can be treated with glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (eg, exenatide and liraglutide) or inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) (eg, sitagliptin and saxagliptin), the enzyme that degrades GLP-1. The GLP-1 receptor agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors both elevate GLP-1 activity and substantially improve glycemic control. The GLP-1 receptor agonists are more effective in lowering blood glucose and result in substantial weight loss, whereas therapy with DPP-4 inhibitors lowers blood glucose levels to a lesser degree, and they are weight neutral. Treatment with GLP-1 receptor agonists has demonstrated durable glycemic control and improvement in multiple cardiovascular disease risk factors. In addition, unlike insulin or sulfonylureas, treatment with a GLP-1 receptor agonist or a DPP-4 inhibitor has not been associated with substantial hypoglycemia. These factors should be considered when selecting monotherapy or elements of combination therapy for patients with type 2 DM who are overweight/obese, for patients who have experienced hypoglycemia with other agents, and when achieving glycemic targets is difficult.",nocancer
"Assessment of preclinical learning on oral surgery using three instructional strategies. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate three learning methods for teaching basic oral surgical skills. Thirty predoctoral dental students without any surgical knowledge or previous surgical experience were divided into three groups (n=10 each) according to instructional strategy: Group 1, active learning; Group 2, text reading only; and Group 3, text reading and video demonstration. After instruction, the apprentices were allowed to practice incision, dissection, and suture maneuvers in a bench learning model. During the students' performance, a structured practice evaluation test to account for correct or incorrect maneuvers was applied by trained observers. Evaluation tests were repeated after thirty and sixty days. Data from resulting scores between groups and periods were considered for statistical analysis (ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer) with a significant level of a=0.05. Results showed that the active learning group presented the significantly best learning outcomes related to immediate assimilation of surgical procedures compared to other groups. All groups' results were similar after sixty days of the first practice. Assessment tests were fundamental to evaluate teaching strategies and allowed theoretical and proficiency learning feedbacks. Repetition and interactive practice promoted retention of knowledge on basic oral surgical skills.",cancer
"Case series. Soft-tissue sarcoma of the foot. BACKGROUND: We reviewed cases of soft-tissue sarcoma of the foot to gain insight into the presentation, treatments and outcomes for this rare disease and to determine whether limb-salvage surgery yields reasonable functional and oncological outcomes. METHODS: We reviewed the cases of 16 patients treated by 2 of us (R.T. and M.I.) for soft-tissue sarcoma of the foot over a 15-year period. We extracted the following information from each patient's medical record: disease status at presentation, prior treatment, histological diagnosis, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage, details of treatment, oncological outcome and functional outcome. Functional outcome was assessed with the Toronto Extremity Salvage Score (TESS) and the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS 1987). RESULTS: Follow-up averaged 6 (range 2-15) years. Eight patients presented after unplanned excision. Histological diagnosis was synovial sarcoma for 7 of 16 patients.The tumours were evenly distributed among the hindfoot, midfoot and forefoot. Most patients (n = 13) presented with AJCC stage II or III disease. Amputation was necessary for 3 patients, whereas limb salvage was possible for the other 13. Free tissue transfer (n = 9) and radiation therapy (n = 12) were used in most cases. Surgical margins were microscopically positive in 4 of the 13 patients treated with limb salvage.Local disease recurred in 2 patients. Lung metastases occurred in 4 patients. At last follow-up, 11 of 16 patients were alive without disease, 2 with disease and 3 had died of their disease. Functional assessment with MSTS 1987 and the TESS averaged 28%and 90%, respectively, after limb salvage. CONCLUSION: In this series, we found that, first, patients frequently presented after unplanned excision, and this may have led to worse oncological outcomes compared with patients who presented primarily. Second, limb salvage was usually possible, but it required accepting marginal resections, relying on free tissue transfer to obtain coverage and using radiation therapy to obtain local control. Third, this combination yielded an acceptable local control rate and very good functional outcomes.",cancer
"Chlamydia trachomatis and risk of prevalent and incident cervical premalignancy in a population-based cohort. BACKGROUND: Cofactors might affect the risk of the rare progression from infection with carcinogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) to cervical premalignancy to invasive cancer. Some studies have observed that Chlamydia trachomatis infection is associated with increased risk for cervical cancer. In a large prospective cohort, we assessed the role of C trachomatis in cervical premalignancy and addressed confounding by HPV. METHODS: We identified 182 women with prevalent and 132 women with incident histological cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 (CIN2), grade 3 (CIN3), or cervical cancer (CIN2+) in the Costa Rica HPV Natural History Study. Control subjects were 995 (approximately 10% of the 10 049) subjects who were randomly selected from the same study. Cervical HPV status at enrollment was determined by MY09/MY11 polymerase chain reaction amplification and dot-blot hybridization. The presence of C trachomatis DNA in cervical exfoliated cells at enrollment was determined by a novel serovar-specific polymerase chain reaction-based C trachomatis detection and genotyping assay. Plasma drawn at enrollment from each subject was used to determine C trachomatis immunoglobulin G (IgG) status. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between C trachomatis and CIN2+, taking into account possible confounding by HPV. RESULTS: C trachomatis positivity at enrollment was associated with CIN2+ and concurrent and subsequent carcinogenic HPV infection. To account for confounding by HPV status, we restricted the analysis to women positive for carcinogenic HPV DNA at enrollment and found no association between C trachomatis status (as assessed by DNA or IgG) at enrollment and combined prevalent and/or incident CIN2+ (for C trachomatis DNA positivity, odds ratio = 0.77, 95% confidence interval = 0.42 to 1.41; for C trachomatis seropositivity, odds ratio = 1.09, 95% confidence interval = 0.85 to 1.41). CONCLUSIONS: We found no association between C trachomatis status, as assessed by DNA or IgG, and risk of cervical premalignancy, after controlling for carcinogenic HPV-positive status. Previous positive associations between C trachomatis and cervical premalignancy could have been caused, in part, by an increased susceptibility to HPV infection.",cancer
"Isomorph expression of BAG-1 gene, ER and PR in endometrial cancer. BACKGROUND: BAG-1 isomorphs are regulating proteins with antiapoptotic action in endometrium. ERa and PRA isomorphs seem to have an important role in endometrial cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated the expression of BAG-1, ERa and PRA isomorphs in endometrioid adenocarcinoma and we correlated them with clinicopathological findings of the tumor. Fresh endometrial tissues were obtained from 33 patients with endometrial carcinoma and 191 paraffin-embedded tissues were analyzed by real-time PCR and immunochemistry for BAG-1, ER and PR. RESULTS: BAG-1 protein is expressed in both nucleus and cytoplasm. Grade 3 tumors were considered to have the highest intensity. Only 4 out of 79 samples showed intense expression of ERa, while 37 samples out of 72 samples strongly expressed PRA. CONCLUSION: BAG-1 nuclear isomorph appeared more frequently in grade 2 tumors than in grade 1 and 3 tumors, and the cytoplasmatic isomorph was expressed more strongly than the nuclear one.",cancer
"Efficacy of a brief cognitive behavioral therapy program to reduce excessive drinking behavior among new recruits entering the Irish Navy: a pilot evaluation. This pilot study evaluated the efficacy of a brief cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention program designed to reduce excessive pre-enlistment drinking behaviors in a sample of Irish Navy recruits undergoing a 16-week basic training course. Participants were randomly allocated to either a treatment (TG) or control group (CG) (N = 13 each). The program was conducted over four consecutive 1.5-hour weekly sessions. Data were collected at pre and post intervention as well as at a 2-month follow-up. In comparison to those in the control group, participants who received the intervention reported increased scores (p < 0.05) in readiness to change drinking at time 2 and reduced scores in binge drinking (p < 0.05) at time 3. There were also marginal changes in self-efficacy and risky drinking behavior. This work adds to the evidence of the emerging efficacy of a workplace CBT intervention for unhealthy drinking.",nocancer
"Everolimus for subependymal giant-cell astrocytomas in tuberous sclerosis. BACKGROUND: Neurosurgical resection is the standard treatment for subependymal giant-cell astrocytomas in patients with the tuberous sclerosis complex. An alternative may be the use of everolimus, which inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin, a protein regulated by gene products involved in the tuberous sclerosis complex. METHODS: Patients 3 years of age or older with serial growth of subependymal giant-cell astrocytomas were eligible for this open-label study. The primary efficacy end point was the change in volume of subependymal giant-cell astrocytomas between baseline and 6 months. We gave everolimus orally, at a dose of 3.0 mg per square meter of body-surface area, to achieve a trough concentration of 5 to 15 ng per milliliter. RESULTS: We enrolled 28 patients. Everolimus therapy was associated with a clinically meaningful reduction in volume of the primary subependymal giant-cell astrocytoma, as assessed on independent central review (P<0.001 for baseline vs. 6 months), with a reduction of at least 30% in 21 patients (75%) and at least 50% in 9 patients (32%). Marked reductions were seen within 3 months and were sustained. There were no new lesions, worsening hydrocephalus, evidence of increased intracranial pressure, or necessity for surgical resection or other therapy for subependymal giant-cell astrocytoma. Of the 16 patients for whom 24-hour video electroencephalography data were available, seizure frequency for the 6-month study period (vs. the previous 6-month period) decreased in 9, did not change in 6, and increased in 1 (median change, -1 seizure; P=0.02). The mean (+/-SD) score on the validated Quality-of-Life in Childhood Epilepsy questionnaire (on which scores can range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a better quality of life) was improved at 3 months (63.4+/-12.4) and 6 months (62.1+/-14.2) over the baseline score (57.8+/-14.0). Single cases of grade 3 treatment-related sinusitis, pneumonia, viral bronchitis, tooth infection, stomatitis, and leukopenia were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Everolimus therapy was associated with marked reduction in the volume of subependymal giant-cell astrocytomas and seizure frequency and may be a potential alternative to neurosurgical resection in some cases, though long-term studies are needed.

"Toxin-related seizures. Toxin-related seizures result from an imbalance in the brain's equilibrium of excitation-inhibition. Fortunately, most toxin-related seizures respond to standard therapy using benzodiazepines. However, a few alterations in the standard approach are recommended to ensure optimal care and expedient termination of seizure activity. If 2 doses of a benzodiazepine do not terminate the seizure activity, a therapeutic dose of pyridoxine (5 g intravenously in an adult and 70 mg/kg intravenously in a child) should be considered. Phenytoin should be avoided because it is ineffective for many toxin-induced seizures and is potentially harmful when used to treat seizures induced by theophylline or cyclic antidepressants.",nocancer
"Safety and effectiveness of a 2009 H1N1 vaccine in Beijing. BACKGROUND: After the first monovalent 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) vaccine became available in September 2009, Chinese officials conducted a mass vaccination program in Beijing. We evaluated the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine. METHODS: During a 5-day period in September 2009, a total of 95,244 children and adults received the PANFLU.1 vaccine (Sinovac Biotech), a monovalent split-virion vaccine of 15 mug of hemagglutinin antigen without adjuvant. We assessed adverse events after immunization through an enhanced passive-surveillance system and through active surveillance, using diary cards and telephone interviews. Active surveillance for neurologic diseases was implemented in hospitals citywide. To assess vaccine effectiveness, we compared the rates of reported laboratory-confirmed cases of 2009 H1N1 virus infection in students who received the vaccine with the rates in those who did not receive the vaccine, starting 2 weeks after the mass vaccination. RESULTS: As of December 31, 2009, adverse events were reported by 193 vaccine recipients. Through hospital-based active surveillance, 362 cases of incident neurologic diseases were identified within 10 weeks after the mass vaccination, including 27 cases of the Guillain-Barre syndrome. None of the neurologic conditions occurred among vaccine recipients. From 245 schools, 25,037 students participated in the mass vaccination and 244,091 did not. During the period from October 9 through November 15, 2009, the incidence of confirmed cases of 2009 H1N1 virus infection per 100,000 students was 35.9 (9 of 25,037) among vaccinated students and 281.4 (687 of 244,091) among unvaccinated students. Thus, the estimated vaccine effectiveness was 87.3% (95% confidence interval, 75.4 to 93.4). CONCLUSIONS: Among 95,244 children and adults in Beijing, the PANFLU.1 vaccine had a safety profile similar to those of seasonal influenza vaccines and appeared to be effective against confirmed H1N1 virus infection in school-age children.

"Infantile hepatic hemangioendothelioma: report of a case with fine needle aspiration findings. BACKGROUND: Infantile hepatic hemangioendothelioma is a rare tumor. Cytologic and histologic differentiation from other hepatic tumors is necessary to determine appropriate therapy. Fine needle aspiration cytology of this rare tumor has not been reported in the literature before. CASE: A 5-month-old female infant presented with hepatomegaly. Computed tomography revealed numerous nodules occupying the entire liver parenchyma that were considered to be metastatic tumors. However, the primary tumor was not detected. Cytology smears revealed numerous clusters of and isolated, benign-looking, cuboidal, round cells that were diagnosed as benign tumors, and a laparotomy was advised. Histology of the nodules showed infantile hepatic hemangioendothelioma. The patient is alive and undergoing supportive therapy. CONCLUSION: A vascular lesion should be considered in a fine needle aspiration biopsy of liver masses in infants, especially when the clinical features are not consistent with a metastatic malignancy. Immunoreactivity for factor VII-related antigen, CD34 and cytokeratin-7 is helpful in establishing the diagnosis.",cancer

"Mediastinoscopy vs endosonography for mediastinal nodal staging of lung cancer: a randomized trial. CONTEXT: Mediastinal nodal staging is recommended for patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Surgical staging has limitations, which results in the performance of unnecessary thoracotomies. Current guidelines acknowledge minimally invasive endosonography followed by surgical staging (if no nodal metastases are found by endosonography) as an alternative to immediate surgical staging. OBJECTIVE: To compare the 2 recommended lung cancer staging strategies. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Randomized controlled multicenter trial (Ghent, Leiden, Leuven, Papworth) conducted between February 2007 and April 2009 in 241 patients with resectable (suspected) NSCLC in whom mediastinal staging was indicated based on computed or positron emission tomography. INTERVENTION: Either surgical staging or endosonography (combined transesophageal and endobronchial ultrasound [EUS-FNA and EBUS-TBNA]) followed by surgical staging in case no nodal metastases were found at endosonography. Thoracotomy with lymph node dissection was performed when there was no evidence of mediastinal tumor spread. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was sensitivity for mediastinal nodal (N2/N3) metastases. The reference standard was surgical pathological staging. Secondary outcomes were rates of unnecessary thoracotomy and complications. RESULTS: Two hundred forty-one patients were randomized, 118 to surgical staging and 123 to endosonography, of whom 65 also underwent surgical staging. Nodal metastases were found in 41 patients (35%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 27%-44%) by surgical staging vs 56 patients (46%; 95% CI, 37%-54%) by endosonography (P = .11) and in 62 patients (50%; 95% CI, 42%-59%) by endosonography followed by surgical staging (P = .02). This corresponded to sensitivities of 79% (41/52; 95% CI, 66%-88%) vs 85% (56/66; 95% CI, 74%-92%) (P = .47) and 94% (62/66; 95% CI, 85%-98%) (P = .02). Thoracotomy was unnecessary in 21 patients (18%; 95% CI, 12%-26%) in the mediastinoscopy group vs 9 (7%; 95% CI, 4%-13%) in the endosonography group (P = .02). The complication rate was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with (suspected) NSCLC, a staging strategy combining endosonography and surgical staging compared with surgical staging alone resulted in greater sensitivity for mediastinal nodal metastases and fewer unnecessary thoracotomies.

"The SUMO pathway: emerging mechanisms that shape specificity, conjugation and recognition. Proteins of the small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) family are conjugated to proteins to regulate such cellular processes as nuclear transport, transcription, chromosome segregation and DNA repair. Recently, numerous insights into regulatory mechanisms of the SUMO modification pathway have emerged. Although SUMO-conjugating enzymes can discriminate between SUMO targets, many substrates possess characteristics that facilitate their modification. Other post-translational modifications also regulate SUMO conjugation, suggesting that SUMO signalling is integrated with other signal transduction pathways. A better understanding of SUMO regulatory mechanisms will lead to improved approaches for analysing the function of SUMO and substrate conjugation in distinct cellular pathways.",nocancer
"Specificity and sensitivity of differentiation antigens in superficial soft tissue tumors: comparison of SMA, calponin, H-caldesmon, C-kit, PLAP and HPL. We examined the expression pattern of smooth muscle actin (SMA), h-caldesmon (HCD), calponin (CALP), placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) and human placental lactogen (HPL) in benign and malignant spindle cell superficial soft tissue tumors in order to determine the role of these markers in differential diagnosis. Archival tissue from 38 patients with superficial smooth muscle cell and so-called fibrohistiocytic tumors (8 benign fibrous histiocytomas (BFHs), 6 dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFPT), 9 malignant fibrous histiocytomas (MFHs), 9 leiomyomas (LMs) and 6 leiomyosarcomas (LMSs)) were immunostained with antibodies against SMA, HCD, CALP, PLAP and HPL. smooth muscle cell (SMC) tumors showed significantly high immunopositivity for HCD than that of so-called fibrohistiocytic tumors (p is less than or equal to 0.05) but 1/3 of DFPT and MFH cases and half of BFH cases also showed HCD immunopositivity; thus, this difference is debatable and not highly discriminative as expected. All tumor groups showed 100% immunopositivity for CALP. SMC tumors displayed significantly stronger and more widespread immunostaining pattern for PLAP than so-called fibrohistiocytic tumors (p < 0.05). Superficial soft tissue tumors did not express c-kit. In conclusion, HCD and PLAP can be used as ancillary immunomarkers in differential diagnosis of SMC tumors (Tab. 2, Fig. 7, Ref. 37).",cancer
"Giant cell arteritis in Mumbai. OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical profile of patients with giant cell arteritis in Mumbai. METHODS: From our database, patients with a diagnosis of giant cell arteritis (GCA) over a fifteen year period (January 1990 to December 2005) were included. Clinical manifestations, temporal artery biopsy, treatment, and follow-up data of these patients were analyzed. RESULTS: Twenty one patients with GCA were identified. However, data were available only for 16 patients. The median age was 66.5 years (58-78 yrs) with male to female ratio of 1:1. The mean time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 5.18 months (0.5-24 months). Clinical manifestations included new onset headache (15), fever (9), weight loss (9), jaw claudication (9), polymyalgia rheumatica (5), visual disturbances (3), scalp nodule (1), temporal artery tenderness (11), tortuosity (9), and scalp tenderness (6). ESR was elevated in 15 patients with a median of 106.5 mm at 1 hr (25-135 mm/hr). Temporal artery biopsy was done in 11 patients and confirmed the diagnosis in 10 patients. Color doppler study of the temporal arteries (9 patients) revealed halo sign (indicating arterial wall edema) in 6 patients. Biopsy as per site by color doppler study was performed in 6 of these patients and was positive in 5. All patients had a good initial response to steroids, however, on follow up, 3 patients required addition of methotrexate. At a median follow up (n = 14) of 6 months (range 6-156), steroids were successfully stopped in 7 patients at 1 to 3 years interval. The disease relapsed in 1 patient. Of the remaining 7 patients, 2 were steroid dependent and 5 patients were doing well on low dose prednisolone. CONCLUSION: GCA, though uncommon in India, should be suspected in all elderly patients with a new onset headache, fever, jaw claudication, or high ESR. Color doppler sonography is a useful noninvasive method for the diagnosis of GCA and also helps to identify the site to biopsy. Most respond to steroid therapy while some need addition of steroid sparing agents.",nocancer
"Direct measurement of instantaneous source speed for a HDR brachytherapy unit using an optical fiber based detector. PURPOSE: Several attempts to determine the transit time of a high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy unit have been reported in the literature with controversial results. The determination of the source speed is necessary to accurately calculate the transient dose in brachytherapy treatments. In these studies, only the average speed of the source was measured as a parameter for transit dose calculation, which does not account for the realistic movement of the source, and is therefore inaccurate for numerical simulations. The purpose of this work is to report the implementation and technical design of an optical fiber based detector to directly measure the instantaneous speed profile of a 192Ir source in a Nucletron HDR brachytherapy unit. METHODS: To accomplish this task, we have developed a setup that uses the Cerenkov light induced in optical fibers as a detection signal for the radiation source moving inside the HDR catheter. As the 192Ir source travels between two optical fibers with known distance, the threshold of the induced signals are used to extract the transit time and thus the velocity. The high resolution of the detector enables the measurement of the transit time at short separation distance of the fibers, providing the instantaneous speed. RESULTS: Accurate and high resolution speed profiles of the 192Ir radiation source traveling from the safe to the end of the catheter and between dwell positions are presented. The maximum and minimum velocities of the source were found to be 52.0 +/- 1.0 and 17.3 +/- 1.2 cm/s. The authors demonstrate that the radiation source follows a uniformly accelerated linear motion with acceleration of [a] = 113 cm/s2. In addition, the authors compare the average speed measured using the optical fiber detector to those obtained in the literature, showing deviation up to 265%. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of the authors' knowledge, the authors directly measured for the first time the instantaneous speed profile of a radiation source in a HDR brachytherapy unit traveling from the unit safe to the end of the catheter and between interdwell distances. The method is feasible and accurate to implement on quality assurance tests and provides a unique database for efficient computational simulations of the transient dose.",cancer
"A sensitive and selective HPLC method for estimation of lamotrigine in human plasma and saliva: application to plasma-saliva correlation in epileptic patients. A sensitive and selective high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method was developed and validated for estimation of lamotrigine (CAS 84057-84-1) in human plasma and saliva. The chromatographic separation was achieved with a reversed phase column and a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and 20 mM ammonium acetate buffer pH 6.5 (30:70) with a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The calibration curve was linear within the working range for both plasma and saliva. The validated method has been successfully applied for a study of lamotrigine in human plasma and saliva to establish the correlation between these two matrices.

"Acetabular and proximal femoral alignment in patients with osteoarthritis of the dysplastic hip and its influence on the progression of disease. In order to evaluate the relationship between acetabular and proximal femoral alignment in the initiation and evolution of osteoarthritis of the dysplastic hip, the acetabular and femoral angles were calculated geometrically from radiographs of 62 patients with pre-arthrosis and early osteoarthritis. The sum of the lateral opening angle of the acetabulum and the neck-shaft angle was defined as the lateral instability index (LII), and the sum of the anterior opening angle of the acetabulum and the anteversion angle of the femoral neck as the anterior instability index (AII). These two indices were compared in dysplastic and unaffected hips. A total of 22 unilateral hips with pre-arthrosis were followed for at least 15 years to determine whether the two indices were associated with the progression of osteoarthritis. The LII of the affected hips (197.4 (sd 6.0)) was significantly greater than that of the unaffected hips (1830 (sd 6.9)). A follow-up study of 22 hips with pre-arthrosis showed that only the LII was associated with progression of the disease, and an LII of 196 was the threshold value for this progression.",nocancer
"Addition of drug/s to a chemotherapy regimen for metastatic breast cancer. BACKGROUND: The addition of a chemotherapy drug or drugs to an established regimen is one method used to increase the dose and intensity of treatment for metastatic breast cancer. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of adding one or more chemotherapy drugs to an established regimen in women with metastatic breast cancer. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's Specialised Register (to August 2009) using the codes for ""advanced breast cancer"" and ""chemotherapy"". This review is an update of the original Cochrane Review (Issue 3, 2006). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials with a first line regimen of at least two chemotherapy drugs compared to the same regimen plus the addition of one or more chemotherapy drugs in women with metastatic breast cancer. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors extracted data independently from published trials. We derived hazard ratios (HR) from time-to-event outcomes where possible, and used a fixed-effect model for meta-analysis. We analysed response rates as dichotomous variables and extracted toxicity data where available. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 17 trials reporting on 22 treatment comparisons (2674 patients randomised). Fifteen trials (20 treatment comparisons) reported results for tumour response and 11 trials (14 treatment comparisons) published time-to-event data for overall survival. There were 1532 deaths in 2116 women randomised to trials of the addition of a drug to the regimen and control (the regimen alone). There was no detectable difference in overall survival between these patients, with an overall HR of 0.96 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 1.07, P = 0.47) and no significant heterogeneity. We found no difference in time to progression between these regimens, with an overall HR of 0.93 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.07, P = 0.31) and no significant heterogeneity. Addition of a drug to the regimen was favourably associated with overall tumour response rates (odds ratio 1.21, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.44, P = 0.04) although we observed significant heterogeneity for this outcome across the trials. Where measured, acute toxicities such as alopecia, nausea and vomiting and leucopenia were more common with the addition of a drug. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The addition of one or more drugs to the regimen shows a statistically significant advantage for tumour response in women with metastatic breast cancer but the results suggest no difference in survival time or time to progression. The positive effect on tumour response was also associated with increased toxicity.",cancer

Currently, sealants are recommended to be placed on teeth that are considered to be ""at risk"" to develop caries, including teeth that present with incipient enamel lesions. This paper discusses the types of sealant materials available and the placement of the sealant, including appropriate tooth preparation, acid-etching, polymerization, and use of adhesives prior to sealant placement.",nocancer
"Optimal immunohistochemical markers for distinguishing lung adenocarcinomas from squamous cell carcinomas in small tumor samples. The histologic subtype of non-small cell lung carcinoma is important in selecting appropriate chemotherapy for patients with advanced disease. As many of these patients are not operative candidates, they are treated medically after biopsy for diagnosis. Inherent limitations of small biopsy samples can make distinguishing poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) from squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) difficult. The value of histochemical and immunohistochemical markers to help separate poorly differentiated ADC from SCC in resection specimens is well established; however, the optimal use of markers in small tissue samples has only recently been examined and the correlation of marker expression in small tissue samples with histologic subtype determined on resection specimens has not been well documented. We address this issue by examining the expression of 9 markers (p63, TTF1, CK5/6, CK7, 34betaE12, Napsin A, mucicarmine, NTRK1, and NTRK2) on 200 cases of ADC and 225 cases of SCC in tissue microarray format to mimic small tissue specimens. The single best marker to separate ADC from SCC is p63 (for SCC: sensitivity 84%, specificity 85%). Logistic regression analysis identifies p63, TTF1, CK5/6, CK7, Napsin A, and mucicarmine as the optimal panel to separate ADC from SCC. Reduction of the panel to p63, TTF1, CK5/6, and CK7 is marginally less effective but may be the best compromise when tissue is limited. We present an algorithm for the stepwise application of p63, TTF1, CK5/6, CK7, Napsin A, and mucicarmine in situations in which separation of ADC from SCC in small specimens cannot be accomplished by morphology alone.",cancer
"Pediatric dental care: prevention and management protocols based on caries risk assessment. Recent increases in caries prevalence in young children, especially among minorities and the economically disadvantaged, highlight the need for early establishment of dental homes and simple, effective infant oral care preventive programs for all children as part of a medical disease prevention management model. This article presents an updated approach and practical tools for pediatric dental caries management by risk assessment in an effort to stimulate greater adoption of infant oral care programs among clinicians and early establishment of dental homes for young children.

"Expression of Her-2 in carcinomas of the esophagus. The human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 gene (HER-2) encodes for a membrane-bound tyrosine kinase (Her-2), which is overexpressed in various human cancers. Her-2-targeted therapy has recently been shown to be beneficial for patients with advanced gastric cancer. Her-2 protein expression was investigated in 341 esophageal carcinomas [152 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), 189 adenocarcinomas (AC)], 39 cases of Barrett mucosa, and 11 cases of squamous cell dysplasia. HER-2 gene amplification was assessed by colorimetric in-situ hybridization. Positive Her-2 status was found in 15.3% of ACs and 3.9% of SCCs. Positive Her-2-status was more common in dysplastic Barrett mucosas compared with nondysplastic ones (P=0.04). In 26% of the patients with ACs who had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n=39), the Her-2 status of pretherapeutic biopsies was different compared with subsequent surgical specimens. There was no statistically significant correlation between Her-2 status and patients' survival. Although Her-2 overexpression is rare in SCCs, it is found in 15.3% of ACs, where amplification of HER-2 gene and overexpression of Her-2 protein seem to be early events in carcinogenesis. The evaluation of Her-2 status in tumor biopsies and in particular in the context with possible alterations after neoadjuvant treatment can potentially lead to false Her-2-staging. Although Her-2-overexpression in esophageal cancer seems to have no influence on patients' survival, these subtypes of esophageal ACs have to be considered as targets for an anti-Her-2 therapy.",cancer
"Psychosocial and dental factors in the maintenance of severe dental fear. The aim was to study the relationship between psychosocial factors and dental status in adult subjects with severe dental fear (DF). A consecutive sample of 148 adults (mean age 36.1 yrs, range 21-69 yrs) referred for dental fear treatment was investigated using an intake questionnaire on dental attendance and history, psychometric questionnaires on dental fear, general anxiety and depression and a radiographic examination. The subjects had a mean DFMT (Decayed, Filled, Missed Teeth) score of 18.6 (SD = 5.6). A deterioration in dental status defined as the presence of root remnants was present in 57% of the subjects and was related to the negative consequences of dental fear, general anxiety and depression. Most subjects (84%) reported clinical levels of general anxiety and 46% reported clinical levels of depression. In conclusion, subjects with severe DF often suffer from psychosocial consequences and distress.This is even more marked if their dental status has deteriorated.The findings support a biopsychosocial vicious circle understanding of the maintenance of DF.",nocancer
"Clonal characterization of bone marrow derived stem cells and their application for bone regeneration. Tissue engineering allows the design of functionally active cells within supportive bio-scaffolds to promote the development of new tissues such as cartilage and bone for the restoration of pathologically altered tissues. However, all bone tissue engineering applications are limited by a shortage of stem cells. The adult bone marrow stroma contains a subset of nonhematopoietic cells referred to as bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). BMSCs are of interest because they are easily isolated from a small aspirate of bone marrow and readily generate single-cell-derived colonies. These cells have the capacity to undergo extensive replication in an undifferentiated state ex vivo. In addition, BMSCs have the potential to develop either in vitro or in vivo into distinct mesenchymal tissues, including bone, cartilage, fat, tendon, muscle, and marrow stroma. Thus, BMSCs are an attractive cell source for tissue engineering approaches. However, BMSCs are not homogeneous and the quantity of stem cells decreases in the bone marrow in aged population. A sequential loss of lineage differentiation potential has been found in the mixed culture of bone marrow stromal cells due to a heterogenous population. Therefore, a number of studies have proposed that homogenous bone marrow stem cells can be generated from clonal culture of bone marrow cells and that BMSC clones have the greatest potential for the application of bone regeneration in vivo.",nocancer

"Effect of integrated care for sick listed patients with chronic low back pain: economic evaluation alongside a randomised controlled trial. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness, cost utility, and cost-benefit of an integrated care programme compared with usual care for sick listed patients with chronic low back pain. DESIGN: Economic evaluation alongside a randomised controlled trial with 12 months' follow-up. SETTING: Primary care (10 physiotherapy practices, one occupational health service, one occupational therapy practice) and secondary care (five hospitals) in the Netherlands, 2005-9. PARTICIPANTS: 134 adults aged 18-65 sick listed because of chronic low back pain: 66 were randomised to integrated care and 68 to usual care. INTERVENTIONS: Integrated care consisted of a workplace intervention based on participatory ergonomics, with involvement of a supervisor, and a graded activity programme based on cognitive behavioural principles. Usual care was provided by general practitioners and occupational physicians according to Dutch guidelines. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was duration until sustainable return to work. The secondary outcome was quality adjusted life years (QALYs), measured using EuroQol. RESULTS: Total costs in the integrated care group ( pound13 165, SD pound13 600) were significantly lower than in the usual care group ( pound18 475, SD pound13 616). Cost effectiveness planes and acceptability curves showed that integrated care was cost effective compared with usual care for return to work and QALYs gained. The cost-benefit analyses showed that every pound1 invested in integrated care would return an estimated pound26. The net societal benefit of integrated care compared with usual care was pound5744. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of an integrated care programme for patients sick listed with chronic low back pain has a large potential to significantly reduce societal costs, increase effectiveness of care, improve quality of life, and improve function on a broad scale. Integrated care therefore has large gains for patients and society as well as for employers.",nocancer
"A randomized trial comparing radiofrequency ablation and surgical resection for HCC conforming to the Milan criteria. OBJECTIVE: To compare the long-term outcomes of surgical resection and radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a promising, emerging therapy for small HCC. Whether it is as effective as surgical resection (RES) for long-term outcomes is still indefinite. METHODS: Two hundred thirty HCC patients who met the Milan criteria and were suitable to be treated by either RES or RFA entered into a randomized controlled trial. The patients were regularly followed up after treatment for 5 years (except for those who died). The primary end point was overall survival; the secondary end points were recurrence-free survival, overall recurrence, and early-stage recurrence. RESULTS: The 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-year overall survival rates for the RFA group and the RES group were 86.96%, 76.52%, 69.57%, 66.09%, 54.78% and 98.26%, 96.52%, 92.17%, 82.60%, 75.65%, respectively. The corresponding recurrence-free survival rates for the 2 groups were 81.74%, 59.13%, 46.08%, 33.91%, 28.69% and 85.22%, 73.92%, 60.87%, 54.78%, 51.30%, respectively. Overall survival and recurrence-free survival were significantly lower in the RFA group than in the RES group (P = 0.001 and P = 0.017). The 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year overall recurrence rates were 16.52%, 38.26%, 49.57%, 59.13%, and 63.48% for the RFA group and 12.17%, 22.60%, 33.91%, 39.13%, and 41.74% for the RES group. The overall recurrence was higher in the RFA group than in the RES group (P = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: Surgical resection may provide better survival and lower recurrence rates than RFA for patients with HCC to the Milan criteria.",cancer
"Recursive subsetting to identify patients in the STAR*D: a method to enhance the accuracy of early prediction of treatment outcome and to inform personalized care. OBJECTIVE: There are currently no clinically useful assessments that can reliably predict--early in treatment--whether a particular depressed patient will respond to a particular antidepressant. We explored the possibility of using baseline features and early symptom change to predict which patients will and which patients will not respond to treatment. METHOD: Participants were 2,280 outpatients enrolled in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study who had complete 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-self-report (QIDS-SR16) records at baseline, week 2, and week 6 (primary outcome) of treatment with citalopram. Response was defined as a >/= 50% reduction in QIDS-SR16 score by week 6. By developing a recursive subsetting algorithm, we used both baseline variables and change in QIDS-SR16 scores from baseline to week 2 to predict response/nonresponse to treatment for as many patients as possible with controlled accuracy, while reserving judgment for the rest. RESULTS: Baseline variables by themselves were not clinically useful predictors, whereas symptom change from baseline to week 2 identified 280 nonresponders, of which 227 were true nonresponders. By subsetting recursively according to both baseline features and symptom change, we were able to identify 505 nonresponders, of which 403 were true nonresponders, to achieve a clinically meaningful negative predictive value of 0.8, which was upheld in cross-validation analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Recursive subsetting based on baseline features and early symptom change allows predictions of nonresponse that are sufficiently certain for clinicians to spare identified patients from prolonged exposure to ineffective treatment, thereby personalizing depression management and saving time and cost.

"Surgical management of submucosal esophageal cancer: extended or regional lymphadenectomy? INTRODUCTION: Radical esophagectomy is considered the standard therapy for tumors that infiltrate the submucosa of the esophagus (T1b), as the prevalence of lymph node metastases has been reported in up to 40% of these patients. It remains unclear whether radical esophagectomy with extended lymphadenectomy is needed or whether a surgical procedure with only regional lymphadenectomy suffices. The aim of this study was to compare outcomes of patients who underwent esophagectomy for T1b cancer through a transthoracic approach with extended lymphadenectomy (TTE) with those of patients in whom transhiatal esophagectomy (THE) was performed with a regional lymph node dissection. METHODS: Patients who underwent esophagectomy for T1b cancer between 1990 and 2004 and who did not receive (neo)adjuvant therapy were included. Data were collected from prospective databases of 4 centers. In Leuven, Belgium (n = 101), and Los Angeles, CA (n = 31), patients with T1b tumors had been operated on via TTE with extended lymphadenectomy, whereas in Amsterdam (n = 43) and Rotterdam (n = 47), the Netherlands, THE with regional lymphadenectomy had been performed. RESULTS: The 2 patient groups (TTE, n = 132; THE, n = 90) were comparable with regard to age, body mass index, and ASA classification. Operative time was longer in patients who underwent TTE (390 minutes) versus THE (250 minutes) (P < 0.001). The yield of lymph nodes resected was higher in the TTE group (median: 32) versus THE (median: 10) (P < 0.001). Overall morbidity, in-hospital mortality, and length of hospital stay were comparable between both the groups. In the TTE group, 27.3% of complications were classified as major versus 14.4% in the THE group (P < 0.001); however, the reoperation rate was higher after THE (12.2%) versus TTE (3.8%) (P = 0.01). There was no difference in pathological outcomes (infiltration depth, pN stage, pM stage, positive lymph node ratio) between both groups. Overall, 5-year survival (63.4% TTE vs 69.4% THE; P = 0.55) and disease-free 5-year survival (76.9% TTE vs 78.3% THE; P = 0.65) were comparable between both the groups. In patients with N1 disease, disease-free 5-year survival was 49.8% in the TTE group versus 40.0% in the THE group (P = 0.57). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with submucosal esophageal cancer (T1b), TTE with extended lymphadenectomy and THE with regional lymphadenectomy had similar short-term outcome and long-term survival. In the selected group of T1bN1 patients, TTE may be the preferred operative technique because of a potential disease-free survival benefit; in patients with T1bN0 disease, THE with en bloc dissection of the esophagus and regional lymph nodes offers an oncologically safe and less invasive treatment.",cancer
"How hardwired is the brain? Technological advances provide new insight into brain malleability and neurotransmission. Any discussion of the impact of nutrition and environment on the brain is based on the premise that the brain is malleable, but just how malleable is this most complex of all organs? And to what extent does the term ""malleability"" extend beyond subtle functional changes into the realms of morphology and connectivity? Recent methodological advances have provided new insight into these issues and have revealed synapse populations that turn over at high rates and synaptic receptors that are continuously on the move. The unveiling of this unsuspected structural plasticity has prompted new research on a class of enzymes (matrix metalloproteinases) that regulate the physical constraints imposed by extracellular matrix molecules. The realization that the brain is more ""softwired"" than previously anticipated emphasizes the relevance of current endeavors to explore the impact of nutrition and exercise on brain function and structure.",nocancer
"Nationwide survey of bisphosphonate therapy for children with reactivated Langerhans cell histiocytosis in Japan. BACKGROUND: Several studies have suggested that Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is responsive to treatment with bisphosphonates (BPs). However the efficacy and safety of BPs therapy for childhood LCH is unknown. PROCEDURE: Data on children with LCH who had received BPs therapy were collected retrospectively from hospitals participating in the Japanese Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group. RESULTS: Twenty-one children with histologically proven LCH were identified. Of these, the case histories of 16 children who had been treated with pamidronate (PAM) for disease reactivation were analyzed in detail. The median post-PAM therapy follow-up period was 2.8 years (range: 0.9-9.3 years). The median age at commencement of PAM therapy was 9.4 years (range: 2.3-15.0 years). All children had one or more bone lesions but none had risk organ (RO) involvement. In the majority of the children, six courses of PAM were administered at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg/course at 4-week intervals. In 12 of the 16 children, all active lesions including lesions of the skin (n = 3) and soft tissues (n = 3) resolved. Of these children, eight children had no active disease for a median of 3.3 years post-PAM therapy (range: 1.8-9.3 years). Progression-free survival (PFS) was 56.3 +/- 12.4% at 3 years. PFS was significantly higher in children with a first reactivation compared with children experiencing a second or subsequent reactivation. CONCLUSIONS: PAM may be an effective treatment for reactivated LCH with bone lesions. A prospective trial of the efficacy of PAM in recurrent pediatric LCH is warranted.",nocancer

"Disease-free interval after primary treatment predicts prognosis of recurrent endometrial carcinoma. AIM: The aim of this study was to determine if the disease-free interval after initial surgical resection has any useful prognostic value for recurrent endometrial carcinoma patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1998 and 2007, complete resection of endometrial carcinoma was achieved in 536 cases at the Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the Osaka University and Osaka Rosai Hospitals of Osaka, Japan. Clinical characteristics of these cases were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Recurrence was subsequently detected in 54 cases. Overall survival after recurrence in 27 patients with recurrences earlier than 12 months who received no postoperative therapy, radiation, and chemotherapy as an adjuvant therapy were significantly shorter than that of those with recurrences later than 12 months with similar treatments. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the disease-free interval was an independent factor for prognosis. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate a significantly worse prognosis in cases with early versus late recurrence of resected endometrial carcinomas, irrespective of the type of adjuvant therapy.",cancer
"Maintenance after a complex orthoperio treatment in a case of generalized aggressive periodontitis: 7-year result. BACKGROUND: Generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAgP) encompasses a distinct type of periodontal disease exhibiting much more rapid periodontal tissue destruction than chronic periodontitis. The best method for management of GAgP may include the use of both regenerative periodontal techniques and the administration of systemic antibiotics. METHODS: The treatment of a case of GAgP over a period of 6.7 years is presented in this case report. Initial periodontal therapy (week 1- 32) consisted of supragingival plaque control and three appointments of scaling and root planing. Based on the periodontal pathogens isolated (5 species), the patient also received metronidazole plus amoxicillin for one week, followed 10 weeks later by metronidazole plus amoxicillin/clavulanate for one week. The patient was put on regular supportive periodontal therapy (SPT) thereafter. Orthodontic treatment was performed after completion of the initial therapy for 96 weeks. Measurements of clinical attachment level, bleeding on probing and plaque index were obtained at every examination. RESULTS: Antimicrobial and mechanical treatment resulted in eradication of all periopathogens and significantly improved all clinical parameters. During orthodontic treatment and active maintenance, there was no relapse of GAgP. The patient participated in SPT for 194 weeks and thereafter decided to discontinue SPT. Twenty-four months later a relapse of GAgP was diagnosed and all teeth had to be extracted. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that a combined mechanical and antimicrobial treatment approach can lead to consistent resolution of GAgP. Further studies including a larger number of cases are warranted to validate these findings.",nocancer
"Imatinib plus peginterferon alfa-2a in chronic myeloid leukemia. BACKGROUND: Imatinib (400 mg daily) is considered the best initial therapy for patients with newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in the chronic phase. However, only a minority of patients treated with imatinib have a complete molecular remission. METHODS: We randomly assigned 636 patients with untreated chronic-phase CML to receive imatinib alone at a dose of 400 mg daily, imatinib (400 mg daily) plus cytarabine (20 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day on days 15 through 28 of each 28-day cycle) or pegylated interferon (peginterferon) alfa-2a (90 mug weekly), or imatinib alone at a dose of 600 mg daily. Molecular and cytogenetic responses, time to treatment failure, overall and event-free survival, and adverse events were assessed. An analysis of molecular response at 12 months was planned. A superior molecular response was defined as a decrease in the ratio of transcripts of the tyrosine kinase gene BCR-ABL to transcripts of ABL of 0.01% or less, corresponding to a reduction of 4 log(10) units or more from the baseline level, as assessed by means of a real-time quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction assay. RESULTS: At 12 months, the rates of cytogenetic response were similar among the four groups. The rate of a superior molecular response was significantly higher among patients receiving imatinib and peginterferon alfa-2a (30%) than among patients receiving 400 mg of imatinib alone (14%) (P=0.001). The rate was significantly higher among patients treated for more than 12 months than among those treated for 12 months or less. Gastrointestinal events were more frequent among patients receiving cytarabine, whereas rash and depression were more frequent among patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2a. CONCLUSIONS: As compared with other treatments, the addition of peginterferon alfa-2a to imatinib therapy resulted in significantly higher rates of molecular response in patients with chronic-phase CML.

"A novel dithiocarbamate analogue with potentially decreased ALDH inhibition has copper-dependent proteasome-inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing activity in human breast cancer cells. Dithiocarbamates are a class of sulfur-based metal-chelating compounds with various applications in medicine. We reported previously that certain members of dithiocarbamates, such as diethyldithiocarbamate, disulfiram (DSF) and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), were able to bind with tumor cellular copper to inhibit tumor growth through the inhibition of proteasome activity and induction of cancer cell apoptosis. Since the DSF is an irreversible inhibitor of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), its ALDH-inhibitory activity might potentially affect its usefulness as an anti-cancer drug. For the purpose of selecting potent anti-cancer compounds that are not ALDH inhibitors and mapping out preliminary structure-activity relationship trends for these novel compounds, we synthesized a series of PDTC analogues and chose three novel compounds to study their ALDH-inhibitory activity, proteasome-inhibitory activity as well as the cancer cell apoptosis-inducing activity. The results showed that compared to DSF, compound 9 has less ALDH inhibition activity, and the in vitro results also proved the positive effects of 9-Cu in proteasome inhibition and apoptosis induction in breast cancer cells, suggesting that 9 as a lead compound could be developed into a novel proteasome inhibitor anti-cancer drug.",cancer
"Early and late results of descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm open repair with deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest. OBJECTIVE: Open repair of descending thoracic aortic and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms may carry low morbidity and mortality, depending on experience of the surgeon and operative technique used. Although thoracic endovascular aortic repair is less invasive, its limitations include anatomy and pathology of the aorta, proximity of major branches, and significant complication and reintervention rates. We retrospectively reviewed a 2-surgeon experience (J.W.F. and J.S.C.) with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest to repair descending thoracic aortic and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. METHODS: All patients (n = 343) who underwent surgical replacement of descending thoracic aortic or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest from 1995 to 2009 were included. Segmental arteries between T8 and the celiac artery were aggressively reimplanted as indicated. Visceral and renal artery bypasses were performed for significant stenosis. Concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting was performed if targets were anterior or lateral wall vessels. Lumbar drains were not routinely used but placed postoperatively on clinical evidence of spinal cord ischemia. RESULTS: Of 343 patients, 98 had descending thoracic aortic aneurysms, 69 had Crawford type I thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, 111 had type II, 32 had type III, and 33 had type IV. Emergency or urgent operations comprised 13% of repairs. Hospital mortalities were 5.0% for all cases, 3.7% for elective cases, and 13.3% for urgent or emergency cases. Overall incidences were 4.4% for stroke, 3.2% for paraplegia or paraparesis, 1.5% for renal failure requiring dialysis, and 3.5% for tracheostomy. The 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates were 90%, 79%, 69%, and 54%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical repair of descending thoracic aortic and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest carries low operative morbidity and mortality and excellent early and late survival rates.

"Prosthetic overhang is the most effective way to prevent scapular conflict in a reverse total shoulder prosthesis. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Despite good clinical results with the reverse total shoulder arthroplasty, inferior scapular notching remains a concern. We evaluated 6 different solutions to overcome the problem of scapular notching. METHODS: An average and a ""worst case scenario"" shape in A-P view in a 2-D computer model of a scapula was created, using data from 200 ""normal"" scapulae, so that the position of the glenoid and humeral component could be changed as well as design features such as depth of the polyethylene insert, the size of glenosphere, the position of the center of rotation, and downward glenoid inclination. The model calculated the maximum adduction (notch angle) in the scapular plane when the cup of the humeral component was in conflict with the scapula. RESULTS: A change in humeral neck shaft inclination from 155 degrees to 145 degrees gave a 10 degrees gain in notch angle. A change in cup depth from 8 mm to 5 mm gave a gain of 12 degrees . With no inferior prosthetic overhang, a lateralization of the center of rotation from 0 mm to 5 mm gained 16 degrees . With an inferior overhang of only 1 mm, no effect of lateralizing the center of rotation was noted. Downward glenoid inclination of 0 masculine to 10 masculine gained 10 degrees . A change in glenosphere radius from 18 mm to 21 mm gained 31 degrees due to the inferior overhang created by the increase in glenosphere. A prosthetic overhang to the bone from 0 mm to 5 mm gained 39 degrees . INTERPRETATION: Of all 6 solutions tested, the prosthetic overhang created the biggest gain in notch angle and this should be considered when designing the reverse arthroplasty and defining optimal surgical technique.",nocancer

"Obstructive sleep apnoea: a clinical review. Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common medical disorder associated with considerable morbidity and is being recognized and diagnosed with increasing frequency. Patients with OSA are frequently overweight and usually present with longstanding history of snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness along with accompanying obesity. The diagnosis is established with Polysomnography (PSG), although the decision as to who should be sent to a sleep laboratory must be individualised, especially for those patients whose main complaint is snoring. The most important factor in the pathogenesis of OSA is a narrow and floppy pharyngeal airway. Of the several treatment modalities which are available presently, the most successful is the application of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) during sleep.",nocancer

"Autophagy and metabolism. Autophagy is a process of self-cannibalization. Cells capture their own cytoplasm and organelles and consume them in lysosomes. The resulting breakdown products are inputs to cellular metabolism, through which they are used to generate energy and to build new proteins and membranes. Autophagy preserves the health of cells and tissues by replacing outdated and damaged cellular components with fresh ones. In starvation, it provides an internal source of nutrients for energy generation and, thus, survival. A powerful promoter of metabolic homeostasis at both the cellular and whole-animal level, autophagy prevents degenerative diseases. It does have a downside, however--cancer cells exploit it to survive in nutrient-poor tumors.",cancer
"Sodium butyrate with UCN-01 has marked antitumour activity against cervical cancer cells. AIM: The effect of combining sodium butyrate (NaB), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, and 7-hydroxy-staurosporine (UCN-01) on cytotoxicity in human cervical carcinoma cells was evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HeLa and CaSki cells were treated using NaB alone or in combination with staurosporine (STS) or its analog UCN-01. Cytotoxicity was determined by flow cytometry and morphological assays. Apoptotic pathways were characterized by Western blotting and immunostaining. CaSki cells were also xenografted into nude mice to assess the in vivo effects of NaB/UCN-01 combination. RESULTS: Treatment with NaB and STS or UCN-01 resulted in enhanced apoptosis of cancer cells. Apoptosis involved mitochondrial pathways and overexpression of p53 and p73. In concordance, co-treatment modulated some p53/p73 downstream targets such as p21, BAX, BCL-2 and BCL-X(L), leading to increased caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. In vivo, NaB/UCN-01 combination exerted a substantial tumour growth suppression effect compared with single treatment. CONCLUSION: UCN-01 was shown to be a potentiator of NaB therapy for cervical cancer cells.",cancer
"Suprasellar arachnoid cyst resulting in the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is occasionally seen after hypothalamic injury or dysfunction, although it typically occurs in association with other endocrine disturbances.

The authors describe the case of an enlarging SAC resulting in SIADH as the only presenting feature, with an otherwise normal hypothalamic-pituitary axis. An SAC was diagnosed in utero in this 5-month-old girl who had a normal functioning hypothalamic-pituitary axis on presentation. Because of cyst enlargement and hydrocephalus, the patient was scheduled for surgery; however, preoperative labs revealed SIADH. After stabilizing the serum sodium concentration with fluid restriction and the administration of 3% sodium chloride, the patient underwent endoscopic cyst fenestration. Postoperatively, she had complete resolution of the SIADH. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion as the presenting symptom of an SAC has not been previously described. In the aforementioned patient, the proposed mechanism for SIADH was enlargement of the suprasellar arachnoid cyst causing compression of the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei and thus overstimulating the secretion of arginine vasopressin, which resulted in SIADH. The association of SIADH with an SAC is reportable, as is the resolution of the SIADH via cyst fenestration. The authors suggest that SIADH is an uncommon presenting feature of SACs and that syndrome resolution is possible with cyst decompression.",cancer
"National estimates of emergency department visits for hemorrhage-related adverse events from clopidogrel plus aspirin and from warfarin. BACKGROUND: Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAT) with clopidogrel plus aspirin is a well-established antithrombotic strategy, with hemorrhage being the chief adverse event (AE) of concern. Outside of clinical trials, few published data describe the magnitude and nature of hemorrhage-related AEs from DAT. METHODS: To estimate the numbers and rates of emergency department (ED) visits for hemorrhage-related AEs (hemorrhage or evaluation for potential hemorrhage) from DAT in the United States and put them in the context of those from warfarin, we analyzed AEs from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-Cooperative Adverse Drug Event Surveillance project, 2006-2008, and outpatient prescribing from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, 2006-2007. RESULTS: Based on 384 cases, there were an estimated 7654 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3325-11 983) ED visits annually for hemorrhage-related AEs from DAT compared with 2926 cases and an estimated 60 575 (36 117-85 033) ED visits from warfarin. Approximately 60% of ED visits for DAT consisted of epistaxis or other minor hemorrhages (eg, bleeding from small cuts). The risk of hospitalization for ED visits involving acute hemorrhages was not significantly different between DAT and warfarin (risk ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.38-1.08). The estimated rate of ED visits involving acute hemorrhages from DAT was 1.2 per 1000 outpatient prescription visits vs 2.5 per 1000 outpatient prescription visits for warfarin (risk ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.15-0.83). CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the acute hemorrhagic risk with DAT is clinically significant and reinforce the importance of practitioners and patients recognizing and anticipating this risk.",nocancer
"Teaching dental students motivational interviewing techniques: analysis of a third-year class assignment. Motivational interviewing (MI) has been promoted in recent years as an effective method for engaging patients in positive health behaviors and increasing adherence to treatment regimens. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a brief training of MI techniques provided within the dental school curriculum. Third-year dental students received three hours of instruction on MI theory and techniques and then were assigned to use the method with a patient and report on their attempt in a paper. To determine if the brief training and paper assignment were effective methods for training students and assessing their understanding of MI methods, the papers were analyzed to assess aspects of the students' self-reported use of MI-related methods. Effective use of MI techniques was demonstrated by students who appropriately matched their intervention to the patient's stage of readiness to change, accurately recognized patient resistance, and responded to resistance. The paper assignment appeared to be an effective method to assess the students' use and understanding of MI-related techniques.",nocancer
"Extraordinary military medical care of a pediatric patient with penetrating pelvic trauma: a case report. Modern military medicine is an ever advancing field, capable of remarkable feats. We present the case of a 16-year-old Iraqi female with a single gunshot wound to the pelvis with extensive rectal injury who survived despite the odds. Using ""damage control"" techniques, this patient survived despite a reported 30% mortality associated with such wounds. During the course of her stay, she was cared for by a multidisciplinary team whose integrated efforts led to survival and complete closure of 2 of 3 wounds prior to discharge. The case demonstrates the success of modern military medical measures applied to a malnourished pediatric civilian in an austere environment. In addition to being noteworthy as an extraordinary case of survival, this case raises questions about the implications of practicing short-term modern medicine on a population that will have to be reintegrated into a primitive medical establishment, possibly before definitive care is complete.",nocancer

"Kinesin I transports tetramerized Kv3 channels through the axon initial segment via direct binding. Precise targeting of various voltage-gated ion channels to proper membrane domains is crucial for their distinct roles in neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission. How each channel protein is transported within the cytoplasm is poorly understood. Here, we report that KIF5/kinesin I transports Kv3.1 voltage-gated K(+) (Kv) channels through the axon initial segment (AIS) via direct binding. First, we have identified a novel interaction between Kv3.1 and KIF5, confirmed by immunoprecipitation from mouse brain lysates and by pull-down assays with exogenously expressed proteins. The interaction is mediated by a direct binding between the Kv3.1 N-terminal T1 domain and a conserved region in KIF5 tail domains, in which proper T1 tetramerization is crucial. Overexpression of this region of KIF5B markedly reduces axonal levels of Kv3.1bHA. In mature hippocampal neurons, endogenous Kv3.1b and KIF5 colocalize. Suppressing the endogenous KIF5B level by RNA interference significantly reduces the Kv3.1b axonal level. Furthermore, mutating the Zn(2+)-binding site within T1 markedly decreases channel axonal targeting and forward trafficking, likely through disrupting T1 tetramerization and hence eliminating the binding to KIF5 tail. The mutation also alters channel activity. Interestingly, coexpression of the YFP (yellow fluorescent protein)-tagged KIF5B assists dendritic Kv3.1a and even mutants with a faulty axonal targeting motif to penetrate the AIS. Finally, fluorescently tagged Kv3.1 channels colocalize and comove with KIF5B along axons revealed by two-color time-lapse imaging. Our findings suggest that the binding to KIF5 ensures properly assembled and functioning Kv3.1 channels to be transported into axons.",nocancer
"Increase of Mcm3 and Mcm4 expression in cervical squamous cell carcinomas. PURPOSE: To examine the relevance of expression of two proteins essential for DNA replication initiation, Mcm3 and Mcm4, in cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). METHODS: 53 cases of cervical squamous cell carcinoma, 35 cervical intraepithelial neoplasias (CIN) grade 2-3, 11 CIN I and 26 normal controls were studied. Immunohistochemistry was performed with anti-Mcm3 and anti-Mcm4 antibodies. RESULTS: We found Mcm3 and Mcm4 protein expression had a tendency to be stronger from control to CSCC. Both Mcm3 and Mcm4 were significantly upregulated in squamous cervical carcinoma compared to the control, CIN grade 1 and grade 2-3 (p < 0.001), and Mcm3 expression was correlated with CSCC cell differentiation. However there were no independent prognosis correlations between Mcm3 and Mcm4 and clinicopathological parameters including age, stage, tumor size, invasive depth and lymph node metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: Mcm3 and Mcm4 were highly expressed in CSCC, and these two proteins might be useful as biomolecular markers in clinical diagnosis.",cancer
"Reducing the gender achievement gap in college science: a classroom study of values affirmation. In many science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines, women are outperformed by men in test scores, jeopardizing their success in science-oriented courses and careers. The current study tested the effectiveness of a psychological intervention, called values affirmation, in reducing the gender achievement gap in a college-level introductory physics class. In this randomized double-blind study, 399 students either wrote about their most important values or not, twice at the beginning of the 15-week course. Values affirmation reduced the male-female performance and learning difference substantially and elevated women's modal grades from the C to B range. Benefits were strongest for women who tended to endorse the stereotype that men do better than women in physics. A brief psychological intervention may be a promising way to address the gender gap in science performance and learning.",nocancer
"Relationships of demographic background and practice setting among practicing physician assistants in the United States. INTRODUCTION: it is assumed that minority health care providers continue to work in primary care and in underserved areas in higher proportions than their nonminority counterparts, regardless of changing workforce practice patterns. The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether this assumption still holds true among US physician assistants (PAs) in light of recent PA specialization. This assumption is important as there is continuing evidence that a similar background between providers and patients can be beneficial to the provider-patient relationship and to patient outcomes. A secondary purpose was to determine the relationships between various demographic variables (eg, race) and current practice specialty and population served among all PAs. METHODS: this cross-sectional study measured demographic and practice setting survey data. A random sample of 10,500 PAs was surveyed. RESULTS: the main finding was that minority PAs were more likely to care for the underserved (31.9% vs. 19.3%) and to work in primary care practices (38.8% vs. 29.3%) than were nonminorities. A significant relationship was also found between serving underserved populations and nonmarried status, as well as age over 39 (these groups were more likely to serve this population, p < 0.01). Household income less than $50,000 at the time of high school graduation was significantly related to caring for underserved individuals (p < 0.01) and working in primary care settings (more likely to serve in these settings, p 0.001). Conclusions: Minority PAs were more likely to care for the underserved and work in primary care settings. Certain other demographic variables among all respondents were also significantly related to service to the underserved and work in primary care settings.",nocancer
"Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma involving mainly the uterus: report of a case using liquid-based cytology of the endometrium. BACKGROUND: Intravascular lymphoma is a rare subtype of extranodal lymphoma. Most instances of the disease are of B-cell lineage. Diagnosis is difficult because of its nonspecific clinical signs, and many cases are diagnosed at autopsy. Uterine involvement is rare, and it is commonly manifested as genital bleeding. In this case, the chief complaint was fever, which is also very rare. CASE REPORT: A 62-year-old woman presented with fever of unknown origin. Computed tomography revealed no localized lesion except for swelling of the right internal iliac nodes. A cytologic smear of the endometrium by liquid-based cytology demonstrated malignant cells. Based on the curettage material, the lesion was diagnosed as an undifferentiated malignant tumor. Total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and pelvic/paraaortic lymphadenectomy revealed widely scattered lymphoma cells of B-cell lineage mainly in the vascular lumina of the uterus, right ovary and lymph nodes. CONCLUSION: The final histologic type was established on the basis of the surgical material of hysterectomy. Diagnosis was difficult because of prominent cellular atypia and rare location of the tumor. Immunocytochemical examination of liquid-based samples can lead to a correct diagnosis of malignant lymphoma, even at the stage of endometrial cytologic examination.",cancer
"Reversal of multidrug resistance in murine lymphoma cells by amphiphilic dihydropyridine antioxidant derivative. BACKGROUND: Multidrug resistance, the principal mechanism by which cancer cells develop resistance to chemotherapy drugs, is a major factor in the failure of many forms of chemotherapies. AIM: The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of K-2-11 on the reversal of multidrug resistance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effects of amphiphilic dihydropyridine derivative K-2-11 were tested on MDR1-expressing mouse lymphoma cells and their parental control. The effects of K-2-11 with and without doxorubicin were studied by determination of cell viability, cell proliferation and production of reactive oxygen species. RESULTS: K-2-11 caused complete reversal of multidrug resistance of the MDR cells, being much more efficient than the positive control verapamil. Accordingly, the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin were enhanced by K-2-11, both in the MDR and in parental cell line, while K-2-11 alone did not affect cell viability. K-2-11 also acted as an antioxidant, reducing the cellular generation of reactive oxygen species. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate the high potential of K-2-11 as a novel antioxidant with potent MDR-blocking ability that should be studied further for development in adjuvant anticancer treatments.",cancer
"Radioembolization with yttrium-90 glass microspheres in hepatocellular carcinoma: European experience on safety and long-term survival. Radioembolization has been demonstrated to allow locoregional therapy of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma not eligible for transarterial chemoembolization or other local therapies. The aim of this study was to validate evidence of the safety and efficacy of this treatment in a European sample of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Therefore, 108 consecutive patients with advanced HCC and liver cirrhosis were included. Yttrium-90 (Y-90) microspheres were administered in a lobar fashion over the right or left branch of the hepatic artery. The response to treatment was evaluated by computed tomography (CT) imaging applying Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and World Health Organization (WHO) criteria with recent European Association for the Study of the Liver / National Cancer Institute (EASL/NCI) amendments. Time to progression (TTP) and overall survival were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. In all, 159 treatment sessions were performed ranging between one to three treatments per patient. The mean radiation dose per treatment was 120 (+/- 18) Gy. According to EASL criteria, complete responses were determined in 3% of patients, partial responses in 37%, stable disease 53%, and primary progression in 6% of patients. TTP was 10.0 months, whereas the median overall survival was 16.4 months. No lung or visceral toxicity was observed. The most frequently observed adverse events was a transient fatigue-syndrome. CONCLUSION: Radioembolization with Y-90 glass microspheres for patients with advanced HCC is a safe and effective treatment which can be utilized even in patients with compromised liver function. Because TTP and survival appear to be comparable to systemic therapy in selected patients with advanced HCC, randomized controlled trials in combination with systemic therapy are warranted.",cancer
"18F-FDG PET/CT for the prediction and detection of local recurrence after radiofrequency ablation of malignant lung lesions. The utility of (18)F-FDG PET/CT for response assessment in malignant lung tumors treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and for the detection and prediction of local recurrence was investigated. METHODS: Between December 17, 2003, and April 9, 2008, 68 consecutive patients (mean age, 68 y) with 94 pulmonary lesions, including metastases (n = 38) and primary lung cancers (n = 44), underwent RFA. Because of inadequate imaging follow-up in 12 patients, only 82 lesions were analyzed (CT scans, n = 82; (18)F-FDG PET/CT scans, n = 62). The median follow-up was 25 mo (range, 12-66 mo). A baseline study was defined as (18)F-FDG PET/CT performed no more than 3 mo before RFA. The first postablation scan was defined as PET/CT performed between 1 and 4 mo after RFA; additional follow-up studies were obtained in some cases between 6 and 12 mo after RFA. The unidimensional maximum diameter of the lesion was recorded on a pretherapy diagnostic CT scan or on the CT component of a pretherapy (18)F-FDG PET/CT scan, whichever was obtained most recently, using lung windows. Maximum standardized uptake values (SUVs) were recorded for all lesions imaged by (18)F-FDG PET/CT. (18)F-FDG uptake patterns on post-RFA scans were classified as favorable or unfavorable. Survival and recurrence probabilities were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Uni- and multivariate analyses were also performed. RESULTS: Before RFA, factors predicting greater local recurrence-free survival included initial lesion size less than 3 cm (P = 0.01) and SUV less than 8 (P = 0.02), although the latter was not an independent predictor in multivariate analysis. Treated metastases recurred less often than treated primary lung cancers (P = 0.03). Important post-RFA factors that related to reduced recurrence-free survival included an unfavorable uptake pattern (P < 0.01), post-RFA SUV (P < 0.01), and an increase in SUV over time after ablation (P = 0.05). CONCLUSION: (18)F-FDG PET/CT parameters on both preablation and postablation scans may predict local recurrence in patients treated with RFA for lung metastases and primary lung cancers.",cancer
"Molecular markers in epithelial ovarian cancer: their role in prognosis and therapy. Epithelial cancer of the ovary is the most lethal malignancy of all gynaecological cancers. Various clinical and pathological features of ovarian cancer are used as predictors of clinical outcome.

The aim of this review article is to describe current theories regarding the pathogenesis and molecular evolution of epithelial ovarian cancer. With respect to the molecules involved, this article focuses on whether they are associated with poor prognosis or not. This evaluation is performed in light of the progress made and the potential usefulness in treatment decisions without overlooking existing controversies that should be further studied. It is tempting to anticipate the gradual integration of molecular profiling in clinical practice.",cancer
"Endoscopic treatment for early stage colorectal tumors: the comparison between EMR with small incision, simplified ESD, and ESD using the standard flush knife and the ball tipped flush knife. BACKGROUND: Early stage colorectal tumors can be removed by endoscopic mucosal resection but larger such tumors (20 mm) may require piecemeal resection. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) using newly developed endo-knives has enabled en-block resection of lesions regardless of size and shape. However ESD for colorectal tumor is technically difficult. Therefore, we performed EMR with small incision (EMR with SI) for more reliable EMR, ESD with snaring (simplified ESD) and ESD using the standard Flush knife and the novel ball tipped Flush knife (Flush knife BT) for easier and safer colorectal ESD. AIMS: The aims of our study were (1) to compare the treatment results of the following 3 methods (EMR with SI/si-mplified ESD/ESD) for early stage colorectal tumors, and (2) to assess the performance of Flush knife BT in colorectal ESD. METHODS: We treated 24/44/468 colorectal tumors and examined the clinicopathological features and treatment results such as tumor size, resected specimen size, procedure time, en-bloc resection rate, complication rate. We also treated 58 colorectal tumors (LST-NG:20, LST-G:36, other:2) using standard Flush knife and 80 colorectal tumors (LST-NG:32, LSTG:44, other:2) using Flush knife BT, and examined the clinicopathological features and treatment results mentioned above and also the procedure speed. RESULT: The median tumor size (mm) (EMR with SI/ simplified EMR/ESD) was 20/17/30 (EMR with SI vs. simplified ESD: p = n.s, simplified ESD vs. ESD: p < 0.0001). The median resected specimen size (mm) was 22.5/26/41 (EMR with SI vs. simplified ESD: p = 0.0018, simplified ESD vs. ESD: p < 0.0001). The procedure time (min.) was 19/27/60 (EMR with SI vs. simplified ESD: p = n.s, simplified ESD vs. ESD: p < 0.0001) The en-block resection rate (%) was 83.3/90.9 /98.9. The complication rate (post-operative bleeding rate/perforation p=n.s). In the treatment results of ESD for LSTs by knives, there was no difference between standard Flush knife and Flush knife BT for clinicopathological features and treatment results (procedure time, complication rate and en bloc R0 resection rate). However, procedure speed (cm2/min.) of LST-G was significantly faster in the Flush knife BT than in standard Flush knife. (standard Flush knife: 0.21 vs. Flush knife BT: 0.27, p = 0.034). CONCLUSION: EMR with small incision (EMR with SI) and ESD with snaring (simplified ESD) are good option to fill the gap between EMR and ESD in the colorectum, and also considered to become the nice training for the introduction of ESD. Flush knife BT appears to improve procedure speed compared with standard Flush knife, especially for LST-G in colo-rectal ESD.",cancer
"Cyclophosphamide monotherapy in children with Burkitt lymphoma: a study from the French-African Pediatric Oncology Group (GFAOP). BACKGROUND: The French African Group of Pediatric Oncology was set-up to improve quality of care for children with cancer. Preliminary observations on the efficacy in Burkitt lymphoma (BL) of a cyclophosphamide monotherapy (CPM) have been published. We report the results of a multicentric prospective study combining first-line CPM and a multidrug second-line chemotherapy (SC) for refractory/relapsed patients. PROCEDURE: Patients </= 18 years with Burkitt or Burkitt-like lymphoma, were included in six countries (Burkina-Faso, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Madagascar, Mali, and Senegal). All patients received three weekly CPM courses (1.2 g/m(2) IV with intrathecal methotrexate and hydrocortisone), stage 3/4 patients received three further courses. SC added methotrexate, vincristine, cytarabine, and prednisone. RESULTS: There were 178 patients included (42 stage 1/2, 134 stage 3/4, and 2 unknown). Isolated facial localization was found in 41 patients, diffuse abdominal involvement in 120 patients including 65 with both. Nine early deaths were reported, toxicity occurred in 136/743 courses (83 patients) and was predominantly hematological. After CPM, complete remission (CR) rate was 47% with a 33% EFS. Because of rapid progression 76/108 eligible patients (85 primary refractory and 23 relapses) received SC resulting in 35.7% CR but a 21% toxic death rate. The OS of the whole strategy was 50.5% and correlated to stage. CONCLUSION: A prospective multicentric study on BL was feasible in very low-income countries. CPM can be recommended in stage 1-2 because of optimal cost/benefit ratio. However, more intensive strategies, still adapted to socio-economic conditions, are required for advanced stages 3 and 4.",cancer
"Double check up of malignancy biopsy specimens for patient safety. BACKGROUND: The diagnostic of malignancy in biopsy specimens is very important because it guides to selected treatment option and prognostic prediction. However biopsy specimens usually have small pieces leading to variations of the interpretation by anatomical pathologists. OBJECTIVE: To detect and correct the errors or the significant discrepancies in the diagnosis of biopsy specimens before sign-out and to determine the frequency of anatomic pathology significant discrepancies. DESIGN: The application of the mutually agreed work instructions (record) for the detection of errors or the significant discrepancies and their process of sign-out. The record of biopsy specimen that received a secondary check (1959 cases, 2005-2007) was analyzed. RESULTS: After a secondary check, 53 cases of non-malignancy for any reason by a second pathologist were included. However when using our definition on significant discrepancies, only 37 cases were considered. Another seven cases with the opinions with malignancy that were of different cell types that do harm to the patients were added. Therefore, 44 cases (2.25%) had truly significant discrepancies. CONCLUSION: The truly significant discrepancy frequency was 2.25% during the process of pre-sign-out secondary check of malignancy of biopsy specimens. The project has been applied as a routine daily work. It can be an innovative safety program for patient in Thailand.",cancer
"Nanotechnology and nanomaterials: toxicology, risk assessment, and regulations. Nanomaterials have very unique chemical and physical properties that suggest potential health hazards, but limited health and safety information exists for engineered nanomaterials. This review identifies a need for expanding efforts for addressing health and safety concerns in nanotechnology development and in nanotoxicology of engineered nanomaterials. The efforts include research to generate data for safety evaluation, toxicologic evaluation of potential human health effects, risk assessment to support risk-management decision-making, and regulations development to protect human health and the environment. The federal government's current understanding is that existing statutory authorities are adequate to address oversight of nanotechnology and its applications. On the other hand, the present review identifies weaknesses in the current research efforts and inadequacies in existing regulations. A collaborative effort involving multidisciplinary groups is a key element to address the related needs and issues. While federal agencies with regulatory responsibilities are looked upon to develop and implement sound policies and regulations to protect public health and the environment, state agencies may be required to initiate policies which rapidly incorporate new innovations and address public concerns. To address current and futures need related to nanotechnology, the responsible state agencies need to fill the information gaps and address the health and environmental issues. In California, activities have been initiated, but legislative authority and resources are required to provide risk assessment and health protection in an efficient and timely manner.",nocancer

"How do specialist breast nurses help breast cancer patients at follow-up? BACKGROUND: As the proportion of survivors from breast cancer increases it is possible that follow-up care could be delivered wholly by generalists to relieve over subscribed hospital clinics. However, guidelines seldom take into account the nature of interactions between patients and health care professionals involved in hospital-based follow-up. METHODS: Consultations between four Specialist Breast Nurses (SBNs) and 21 consecutive women attending a hospital-based breast cancer follow-up clinic in Western Australia were audio recorded and subjected to a thematic analysis. Recording of consultations ceased with saturation of themes. We analysed the data with reference to theoretical frameworks which postulate that social support is a powerful factor in determining positive health outcomes. We also drew on theories focusing on biographical disruption, biographical reinforcement and biographical reinvention. RESULTS: The majority of participants were Australian born, married women in their sixties. The mean duration of the consultations was 19 min (SD = 7.5, min = 8, max = 43.5). A core theme was the established relationship between the woman and her SBN. Overall, the SBNs played an important role in facilitating the transition of patients by supporting the woman in adjustment to a new self-image and bodily functioning. The SBN accompanies each woman through this phase in her life, white supporting a new narrative, promoting her 'rebirth' as someone with ideas, concerns and expectations that have altered significantly after the diagnosis of cancer. Five key themes emerged to demonstrate this supportive role: normalising; facilitating access to services; prevention; promoting self-esteem and promoting a proactive approach. CONCLUSIONS: Many women with breast cancer claimed a new perspective on what was now possible, acceptable or desirable in a host of life domains. Our data suggest that the follow-up care of cancer patients is more than just dealing with a checklist of symptoms but requires an understanding of the biographical disruption occasioned by a diagnosis of breast cancer.",cancer
"Shading correction for on-board cone-beam CT in radiation therapy using planning MDCT images. PURPOSE: Applications of cone-beam CT (CBCT) to image-guided radiationtherapy (IGRT) are hampered by shading artifacts in the reconstructed images. These artifacts are mainly due to scatter contamination in the projections but also can result from uncorrected beam hardening effects as well as nonlinearities in responses of the amorphous silicon flat panel detectors. While currently, CBCT is mainly used to provide patient geometry information for treatment setup, more demanding applications requiring high-quality CBCT images are under investigation. To tackle these challenges, many CBCT correction algorithms have been proposed; yet, a standard approach still remains unclear. In this work, we propose a shading correction method for CBCT that addresses artifacts from low-frequency projection errors. The method is consistent with the current workflow of radiation therapy. METHODS: With much smaller inherent scatter signals and more accurate detectors, diagnostic multidetector CT (MDCT) provides high quality CT images that are routinely used for radiation treatment planning. Using the MDCT image as ""free"" prior information, we first estimate the primary projections in the CBCT scan via forward projection of the spatially registered MDCT data. Since most of the CBCT shading artifacts stem from low-frequency errors in the projections such as scatter, these errors can be accurately estimated by low-pass filtering the difference between the estimated and raw CBCT projections. The error estimates are then subtracted from the raw CBCT projections. Our method is distinct from other published correction methods that use the MDCT image as a prior because it is projection-based and uses limited patient anatomical information from the MDCT image. The merit of CBCT-based treatment monitoring is therefore retained. RESULTS: The proposed method is evaluated using two phantom studies on tabletop systems. On the Catphan 600 phantom, our approach reduces the reconstruction error from 348 Hounsfield unit (HU) without correction to 4 HU around the object center after correction, and from 375 HU to 17 HU in the high-contrast regions. In the selected regions of interest (ROIs), the average image contrast is increased by a factor of 3.3. When noise suppression is implemented, the proposed correction substantially improves the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and therefore the visibility of low-contrast objects, as seen in a more challenging pelvis phantom study. Besides a significant improvement in image uniformity, a low-contrast object of approximately 25 HU, which is otherwise buried in the shading artifacts, can be clearly identified after the proposed correction due to a CNR increase of 3.1. Compared to a kernel-based scatter correction method coupled with an analytical beam hardening correction, our approach also shows an overall improved performance with some residual artifacts. CONCLUSIONS: By providing effective shading correction, our approach has the potential to improve the accuracy of more advanced CBCT-based clinical applications for IGRT, such as tumor delineation and dose calculation.",cancer

"Hemostatic proteins and their association with hematoma growth in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We tested the hypothesis that proteins of hemostasia could be associated with hematoma growth (HG) in patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage. METHODS: We prospectively studied patients with spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage within the first 6 hours after the onset of symptoms. HG was defined as an increase > 33% in the volume of hematoma on CT obtained 24 to 72 hours after the onset of symptoms in comparison with the CT obtained at admission. We collected admission and follow-up blood samples. We measured fibrinogen, factor XIII, thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor, plasminogen, alpha(2)-antiplasmin, tissue plasminogen activator, d-dimer, thrombomodulin, thrombin-antithrombin complex, and plasmin-antiplasmin complex. RESULTS: We included 90 patients with a mean age of 71 +/- 10.8 years; 61% were men. HG was observed in 35 (39%) of the patients. Mean baseline and follow-up protein measurements showed no difference between the groups with and without HG. The analysis of variance showed that factor XIII activity decreased in the non-HG group in the 24 to 72 hours sample, whereas it increased in the HG group (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Factor XIII was the only measured protein related to HG. The levels at the follow-up sample decreased in the non-HG group and increased in the HG group. Further studies are needed to confirm this association.",nocancer
"Attitudes of first-year physician assistant students towards older adults. PURPOSE: research has established that attitudes can influence behavior. However, there is little information on physician assistant (PA) students' attitudes towards older adults. Research conducted on medical students has often revealed negative attitudes and little interest in geriatrics. This study investigates the attitudes of first-year PA students regarding older adults and provides data on this underdeveloped area in the literature. METHODS: first-year PA students at Western Michigan University were invited to participate in a study that involved responding to two questionnaires: a modified version of Polizzi's 2003 Aging Semantic Differential (ASD), using men and women aged 70 to 85 as the target population, and a survey consisting of custom-made, fill-in, Likert-scale questions regarding relationships and contact with older adults. RESULTS: the mean ASD score of 2.53 indicated a mildly positive attitude towards the target population. The only significant association found through regression analyses was that students with weekly socialization with older adults had more positive attitudes towards them than did the students with yearly socialization. CONCLUSIONS: the direct and significant association of frequency of socialization with positive attitude towards older adults is consistent with similar research on first-year medical students. Some medical schools have implemented strategies of intentional socialization between their students and older adults to improve the students' attitudes. PA programs may want to further assess their students' attitudes to older adults and implement interventions to improve them, where indicated. Additionally, several questions for additional research are suggested from this study.",nocancer
"Therapies for refractory hypoxemia in acute respiratory distress syndrome. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common and severe form of acute lung injury, resulting from both direct (eg, pneumonia) and indirect (eg, sepsis) pulmonary insults. It is a common cause of admission to the intensive care unit due to hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In some patients, ARDS leads to the development of life-threatening refractory hypoxemia. In these patients, physicians may consider a number of therapies (eg, recruitment maneuvers, prone positioning, inhaled nitric oxide, high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) to alleviate hypoxemia in patients unable to maintain reasonable oxygenation while being supported with conventional mechanical ventilation. Although these strategies have demonstrated improved oxygenation with their use, their impact on patient-important outcomes (eg, mortality) remains unproven. However, in the minority of patients with ARDS and refractory hypoxemia, institution of these therapies may be considered on a case-by-case basis. Future studies are needed to elucidate the efficacy of these therapies on outcomes in patients with severe ARDS and refractory hypoxemia.",nocancer
"Aquaporin expression in the brains of patients with or without cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Aquaporins have recently been identified as protein channels involved in water transport. These channels may play a role in the edema formation and alterations in microvascular function observed in Alzheimer disease (AD) and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). We investigated the expression of aquaporin 1 (AQP1) and aquaporin 4 (AQP4) in 24 human autopsy brains consisting of 18 with AD and varying degrees of CAA and 6 with no pathologic abnormalities using immunohistochemistry. In cases of AD and CAA, there was enhanced AQP4 expression compared with the age- and sex-matched controls. Aquaporin 4 immunoreactivity was prominent at the cerebrospinal fluid and brain interfaces, including subpial, subependymal, pericapillary, and periarteriolar spaces. Aquaporin 1 expression in AD and CAA cases was not different from that in age- and sex-matched controls. Double labeling studies demonstrated that both AQP1 and 4 were localized to astrocytes. Both enhanced AQP4 expression and its unique staining pattern suggest that these proteins may be important in the impaired water transport observed in AD and CAA.",nocancer
"Including self-reported race to improve cancer surveillance data for American Indians and Alaska Natives in Washington state. BACKGROUND: American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) are frequently misclassified as another race in cancer surveillance systems, resulting in underestimated morbidity and mortality. Linkage methods with administrative records have been used to correct AI/AN misclassification, but AI/AN populations living in urban areas, and those who self-identify as AI/AN race, continue to be under-ascertained. The aim of this study was to evaluate racial misclassification in two cancer registries in Washington State using an urban AI/AN patient roster linked with a list of Indian Health Service (IHS) enrollees. METHODS: We conducted probabilistic record linkages to identify racial misclassification using a combined demographic dataset of self-identified AI/AN patients of a large, urban Indian health center, and administratively-identified AI/AN enrolled with the IHS. Age-adjusted incidence rates were calculated for 3 linkage populations: AI/ AN originally coded in each cancer registry, post-linkage AI/AN identified through the IHS roster alone, and post-linkage AI/AN identified through either the urban or IHS file. RESULTS: In the state and regional cancer registries, 11% and 18%, respectively, of matched cases were originally coded as a race other than AI/AN; approximately 35% of these were identified by the urban file alone. Incidence rate estimates increased after linkage with the IHS file, and further increased with the addition of urban records. Matches identified by the urban patient file resulted in the largest relative incidence change being demonstrated for King County (which includes Seattle); the all-site invasive cancer rate increased 8.8%, from 443 to 482 per 100,000. CONCLUSIONS: Inclusion of urban and self-identified AI/AN records can increase case ascertainment in cancer surveillance systems beyond linkage methods using only administrative sources.",cancer
"Bone metastasis arising from a polyp of the cervix as the first symptom in generalized multi-organ adenocarcinoma. Our patient was a 40-year-old female with a positive familial history for malignancies but no chronic diseases. After two vaginal deliveries without any reported difficulties, the patient had no intermenstrual bleeding, postcoital bleeding, leucorrhea or hypermenorrhea, abnormal vaginal bleeding, or postmenstrual bleeding, except during the past five-year period when a polyp-like change in the cervix was found. There was no indication for polypectomy, considering the fact that the patient had no symptoms, had an iodine positive Schiller test, as well as regular cytological smears on Papanicolaou testing. It is noteworthy that the patient had no symptoms until changes in the stool and painful sensation in the hip area. The patient was subjected to extensive surgery by a team composed of a gynecologist, surgeon and orthopedist. During Werthaim-Meigs surgery, four positive glandules and cervical adenocarcinoma Stage II were found. The colon was removed, as a right hemicolectomy, as well as the iliac bone upper segment. Unfortunately, considering the changes in the tissue of the colon and cervix, we considered the condition to be ""generalized"" adenocarcinoma.",cancer
"Patterns of alcohol consumption and ischaemic heart disease in culturally divergent countries: the Prospective Epidemiological Study of Myocardial Infarction (PRIME). OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of alcohol intake patterns on ischaemic heart disease in two countries with contrasting lifestyles, Northern Ireland and France. DESIGN: Cohort data from the Prospective Epidemiological Study of Myocardial Infarction (PRIME) were analysed. Weekly alcohol consumption, incidence of binge drinking (alcohol >50 g on at least one day a week), incidence of regular drinking (at least one day a week, and alcohol <50 g if on only one occasion), volume of alcohol intake, frequency of consumption, and types of beverage consumed were assessed once at inclusion. All coronary events that occurred during the 10 year follow-up were prospectively registered. The relation between baseline characteristics and incidence of hard coronary events and angina events was assessed by Cox's proportional hazards regression analysis. SETTING: One centre in Northern Ireland (Belfast) and three centres in France (Lille, Strasbourg, and Toulouse). PARTICIPANTS: 9778 men aged 50-59 free of ischaemic heart disease at baseline, who were recruited between 1991 and 1994. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incident myocardial infarction and coronary death (""hard"" coronary events), and incident angina pectoris. RESULTS: A total of 2405 men from Belfast and 7373 men from the French centres were included in the analyses, 1456 (60.5%) and 6679 (90.6%) of whom reported drinking alcohol at least once a week, respectively. Among drinkers, 12% (173/1456) of men in Belfast drank alcohol every day compared with 75% (5008/6679) of men in France. Mean alcohol consumption was 22.1 g/day in Belfast and 32.8 g/day in France. Binge drinkers comprised 9.4% (227/2405) and 0.5% (33/7373) of the Belfast and France samples, respectively. A total of 683 (7.0%) of the 9778 participants experienced ischaemic heart disease events during the 10 year follow-up: 322 (3.3%) hard coronary events and 361 (3.7%) angina events. Annual incidence of hard coronary events per 1000 person years was 5.63 (95% confidence interval 4.69 to 6.69) in Belfast and 2.78 (95% CI 2.41 to 3.20) in France. After multivariate adjustment for classic cardiovascular risk factors and centre, the hazard ratio for hard coronary events compared with regular drinkers was 1.97 (95% CI 1.21 to 3.22) for binge drinkers, 2.03 (95% CI 1.41 to 2.94) for never drinkers, and 1.57 (95% CI 1.11 to 2.21) for former drinkers for the entire cohort. The hazard ratio for hard coronary events in Belfast compared with in France was 1.76 (95% CI 1.37 to 2.67) before adjustment, and 1.09 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.50) after adjustment for alcohol patterns and wine drinking. Only wine drinking was associated with a lower risk of hard coronary events, irrespective of the country. CONCLUSIONS: Regular and moderate alcohol intake throughout the week, the typical pattern in middle aged men in France, is associated with a low risk of ischaemic heart disease, whereas the binge drinking pattern more prevalent in Belfast confers a higher risk.",nocancer
"Pretargeted 177Lu radioimmunotherapy of carcinoembryonic antigen-expressing human colonic tumors in mice. Pretargeted radioimmunotherapy (PRIT) with bispecific antibodies in combination with a radiolabeled peptide reduces the radiation dose to normal tissues, especially the bone marrow. In this study, the optimization, therapeutic efficacy, and toxicity of PRIT of colon cancer with a (177)Lu-labeled peptide was determined in mice with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-expressing human tumors. METHODS: To obtain the optimal therapeutic efficacy, several strategies were evaluated to increase the total amount of radioactivity targeted to subcutaneous LS174T colon cancer tumors in BALB/c nude mice. First, the maximum amount of bispecific anti-CEA and antihapten antibody TF2 and the peptide IMP288 that could be targeted was determined. Second, the tumor targeting of repeated administrations of radiolabeled IMP288 was investigated. Mice received 1 TF2 injection, followed by multiple IMP288 injections (3-h interval) or multiple cycles, with each IMP288 administration preceded by a new TF2 injection (72-h interval). PRIT was administered at maximum doses of TF2 and (177)Lu-labeled IMP288 in groups of 9 mice with subcutaneous LS174T tumors. Mice received 1, 2, or 3 successive cycles of treatment (26 MBq/mouse/cycle) or carrier only. The primary endpoint was survival; secondary endpoints were tumor growth, body weight, bone marrow, and renal toxicity. RESULTS: The highest amount of radioactivity delivered to a subcutaneous colon tumor was achieved by the administration of 5.0 nmol of TF2 and 0.28 nmol of IMP288 in 3 successive cycles, with each IMP288 preceded by a new TF2 injection (72-h interval). PRIT effectively delayed tumor growth and prolonged survival significantly. Higher activity doses, administered in successive cycles, correlated with longer survival: the median survival of untreated mice was 13 d (range, 6-20 d), whereas that of mice treated with 1, 2, or 3 cycles of PRIT was 24 (range, 24-31 d), 45 (range, 38 >/= 130 d), and 65 (range, 48 >/= 130 d) days, respectively. Toxicity was limited: no significant changes in mean body weight were measured. Minimal changes in leukocyte counts were measured at 2 and 3 wk after injection, with full recovery within 7 wk after treatment. Platelet counts were unaffected. Serum creatinine levels were not increased significantly; thus, there was no indication of acute renal toxicity. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that PRIT in mice is an effective treatment modality against colon cancer, with limited toxicity.",cancer

"""Pinheads"": the exhibition of neurologic disorders at ""The Greatest Show on Earth"". The circus sideshow was a smorgasbord of human performers, shrewdly designed to entertain the middle-class public and exploit the attitudes of the time. Under the vernacular of ""pinheads,"" people with microcephaly and mental retardation were displayed as ""freaks."" This article presents original materials from the Ringling Brothers Circus Museum Archives and Harvard Theater Collection, including sideshow banners, circus programs, song lyrics, and performance photographs, in addition to contemporary newspaper articles, major medical journal publications, and other secondary sources regarding microcephaly in the 19th and early 20th century circuses. More than 20 performers were exhibited as ""pinheads,"" popularly portrayed as ""missing links"" or children from lost civilizations. People with neurologic disorders were displayed as wild and juvenile and thus, joined a series of hoaxes of the American sideshow. Although incomplete data exist on their true lives, the exhibition of people with microcephaly eventually declined due to protective laws passed in part due to the American circus ""freak shows.""",nocancer
"Synthesis and biological evaluation of Apogossypolone derivatives as pan-active inhibitors of antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) family proteins. Overexpression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins is commonly related with tumor maintenance, progression, and chemoresistance. Inhibition of these antiapoptotic proteins is an attractive approach for cancer therapy. Guided by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) binding assays, a series of 5,5' substituted compound 6a (Apogossypolone) derivatives was synthesized and identified pan-active antagonists of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, with binding potency in the low micromolar to nanomolar range. Compound 6f inhibits the binding of BH3 peptides to Bcl-X(L), Bcl-2, and Mcl-1 with IC(50) values of 3.10, 3.12, and 2.05 muM, respectively. In a cellular assay, 6f potently inhibits cell growth in several human cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Compound 6f further displays in vivo efficacy in transgenic mice and demonstrated superior single-agent antitumor efficacy in a PPC-1 mouse xenograft model. Together with its negligible toxicity, compound 6f represents a promising drug lead for the development of novel apoptosis-based therapies for cancer.",cancer
"Positive and negative affect, life satisfaction, and coping with stress by attachment styles in Turkish students. The purpose was to investigate positive and negative affect, life satisfaction, and coping with stress in relation to attachment styles. Undergraduate students (N=421) completed the Relationship Scales Questionnaire, the Positive and Negative Affect Scale, the Satisfaction With Life Scale, and the Coping with Stress Scale. Results indicated that secure attachment style was the unique predictor of positive affect while fearful and preoccupied attachment styles significantly predicted negative affect. Regarding life satisfaction, a positive correlation with secure attachment style and a negative correlation with fearful and preoccupied styles were seen. However, the unique predictor of life satisfaction was preoccupied attachment style. In terms of coping with stress, there was no significant association between attachment variables and avoidance coping style, but significant links were observed between problem-focused coping and dismissing, and fearful and preoccupied attachment styles.",nocancer
"Implementation of the guided reading approach with elementary school deaf students. The researchers investigated the effects of the Guided Reading approach (Fountas & Pinnell, 1996) on the reading development of elementary school deaf students over a period of 2 school years. A single-subject experimental research designed was used. Qualitative analyses of observations of instruction and interviews with the teachers were conducted to determine fidelity to the Guided Reading protocol. Visual display of graphed Running Records scores during the 2-year implementation showed that all students improved during intervention, all participants except the oldest group experienced a drop in scores from the end of one school year to the beginning of the next, and that it took months for most students to regain their previous year's scores; some had not done so even by the end of fall term.",nocancer
"Bcl-2 and beta1-integrin predict survival in a tissue microarray of small cell lung cancer. INTRODUCTION: Survival in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is limited by the development of chemoresistance. Factors associated with chemoresistance in vitro have been difficult to validate in vivo. Both Bcl-2 and beta(1)-integrin have been identified as in vitro chemoresistance factors in SCLC but their importance in patients remains uncertain. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) are useful to validate biomarkers but no large TMA exists for SCLC. We designed an SCLC TMA to study potential biomarkers of prognosis and then used it to clarify the role of both Bcl-2 and beta(1)-integrin in SCLC. METHODS: A TMA was constructed consisting of 184 cases of SCLC and stained for expression of Bcl-2 and beta(1)-integrin. The slides were scored and the role of the proteins in survival was determined using Cox regression analysis. A meta-analysis of the role of Bcl-2 expression in SCLC prognosis was performed based on published results. RESULTS: Both proteins were expressed at high levels in the SCLC cases. For Bcl-2 (n=140), the hazard ratio for death if the staining was weak in intensity was 0.55 (0.33-0.94, P=0.03) and for beta(1)-integrin (n=151) was 0.60 (0.39-0.92, P=0.02). The meta-analysis showed an overall hazard ratio for low expression of Bcl-2 of 0.91(0.74-1.09). CONCLUSIONS: Both Bcl-2 and beta(1)-integrin are independent prognostic factors in SCLC in this cohort although further validation is required to confirm their importance. A TMA of SCLC cases is feasible but challenging and an important tool for biomarker validation.",cancer
"The outcome of pelvic reconstruction with non-vascularised fibular grafts after resection of bone tumours. We retrospectively evaluated 18 patients with a mean age of 37.3 years (14 to 72) who had undergone pelvic reconstruction stabilised with a non-vascularised fibular graft after resection of a primary bone tumour. The mean follow-up was 10.14 years (2.4 to 15.7). The mean Musculoskeletal Tumor Society Score was 76.5% (50% to 100%). Primary union was achieved in the majority of reconstructions within a mean of 22.9 weeks (7 to 60.6). The three patients with delayed or nonunion all received additional therapy (chemotherapy/radiation) (p = 0.0162). The complication rate was comparable to that of other techniques described in the literature. Non-vascularised fibular transfer to the pelvis is a simpler, cheaper and quicker procedure than other currently described techniques. It is a biological reconstruction with good results and a relatively low donor site complication rate. However, adjuvant therapy can negatively affect the outcome of such grafts.",cancer
"Cost-effectiveness of hybrid PET/CT for staging of non-small cell lung cancer. Although the diagnostic effectiveness of integrated PET/CT for staging of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has already been proven, it remains to be determined if tumor staging with combined metabolic and anatomic imaging is also cost-effective. The objective of this study was to evaluate from a payers' perspective the cost-effectiveness of staging NSCLC with CT alone (representing the mainstay diagnostic test) and with integrated PET/CT. METHODS: The study is based on 172 NSCLC patients from a prospective clinical study who underwent diagnostic, contrast-enhanced helical CT and integrated PET/CT. Imaging was performed at the University Hospital Ulm between May 2002 and December 2004. To calculate treatment costs, we differentiated among cost for diagnosis, cost for nonsurgical treatment according to the clinical diagnosis, and cost for surgical procedures according to the clinical tumor stage. RESULTS: The diagnostic effectiveness in terms of correct TNM staging was 40% (31/77) for CT alone and 60% (46/77) for PET/CT. For the assessment of resectability (tumor stages Ia-IIIa vs. IIIb-IV), 65 of 77 patients (84%) were staged correctly by PET/CT (CT alone, 70% [54/77]). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per correctly staged patient were $3,508 for PET/CT versus CT alone. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per quality-adjusted life year gained were $79,878 for PET/CT vs. CT alone, decreasing to $69,563 assuming a reduced loss of utility (0.10 quality-adjusted life years) due to surgical morbidity. CONCLUSION: Cost-effectiveness analyses showed that costs for PET/CT are within the commonly accepted range for diagnostic tests or therapies. Therefore, reimbursement of PET/CT for NSCLC staging can be also recommended from an economic point of view.",cancer
"Botulinum toxin for the treatment of headache: a promising path on a ""dead end road""? Available preventive treatments for primary headaches such as migraines and tension-type headaches have limited efficacy and often disabling side effects (Schoenen 2004, Schoenen 2000). There is thus room for new more effective and better tolerated therapeutic approaches as long as they can be proven superior to placebo. Based on pilot studies and open trials, botulinum toxin (BT) appeared in the headache armamentarium more than a decade ago and it remains widely used in North America since. The initial enthusiasm for BT was not confirmed by subsequent randomized controlled trials reviewed in this article, neither in tension-type headache, nor in episodic migraine and hence BT was considered a ""dead end road"" by certain headache experts. A promising ""path"" for BT may, however, exist. In two recent trials (PREEMPT 1 and 2), OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) was found effective in chronic migraine. The therapeutic gain over placebo is modest (+/- 11%), but chronic migraine is most disabling, often drug resistant and a serious public health problem, as it affects 1-2% of people in the general population. Because the PREEMPT trials leave unsolved a number of clinically relevant questions, OnabotulinumtoxinA cannot become yet the pre-emptor of CM treatment. Although the path is promising, it seems wise, at this stage, to restrict its use to specialized headache centres where BT can be included in a multidisciplinary approach for chronic headache patients.",nocancer
"The Second National Sun Survey: overview and methods. The Second National Sun Survey (NSS2) was carried out in 2006 to estimate ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure, sun protection and related knowledge, attitudes and beliefs among Canadians. This paper provides a detailed overview of NSS2 methods and discusses the strengths and limitations of the survey. The NSS2 consists of two questionnaires administered to two samples of adults (age 16+ years). The base sample provides in-depth information on UVR exposure, protective behaviours, tanning, and knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about sun safety for adults, as well as some sun behaviour information for a sample of their children aged 1-12 years. The shorter comparison sample facilitates direct comparison with the 1996 first national sun survey. Data were collected using computer-assisted telephone interviewing, and sample weights were computed for all respondents for estimation and analysis of both adult and child data. Base sample interviews were completed for 7,121 adults, of whom 1,437 reported on the sun behaviour of one of their children, and the comparison sample yielded 2,115 interviews. Response rates were 63% for both surveys. The NSS2 provides in-depth and up-to-date UVR exposure information among Canadians. The results of this survey will aid health promotion experts and policy-makers in developing effective programs to minimize UVR exposure. A public use data file and training in statistical analysis of the NSS2 has been made available to data analysts from across Canada. Key strengths and limitations identified in this survey will inform the development and implementation of future sun surveys.",cancer
"Validation of an atrial fibrillation risk algorithm in whites and African Americans. BACKGROUND: We sought to validate a recently published risk algorithm for incident atrial fibrillation (AF) in independent cohorts and other racial groups. METHODS: We evaluated the performance of a Framingham Heart Study (FHS)-derived risk algorithm modified for 5-year incidence of AF in the FHS (n = 4764 participants) and 2 geographically and racially diverse cohorts in the age range 45 to 95 years: AGES (the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study) (n = 4238) and CHS (the Cardiovascular Health Study) (n = 5410, of whom 874 [16.2%] were African Americans). The risk algorithm included age, sex, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, electrocardiographic PR interval, hypertension treatment, and heart failure. RESULTS: We found 1359 incident AF events in 100 074 person-years of follow-up. Unadjusted 5-year event rates differed by cohort (AGES, 12.8 cases/1000 person-years; CHS whites, 22.7 cases/1000 person-years; and FHS, 4.5 cases/1000 person-years) and by race (CHS African Americans, 18.4 cases/1000 person-years). The strongest risk factors in all samples were age and heart failure. The relative risks for incident AF associated with risk factors were comparable across cohorts and race groups. After recalibration for baseline incidence and risk factor distribution, the Framingham algorithm, reported in C statistic, performed reasonably well in all samples: AGES, 0.67 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64-0.71); CHS whites, 0.68 (95% CI, 0.66-0.70); and CHS African Americans, 0.66 (95% CI, 0.61-0.71). Risk factors combined in the algorithm explained between 47.0% (AGES) and 63.6% (FHS) of the population-attributable risk. CONCLUSIONS: Risk of incident AF in community-dwelling whites and African Americans can be assessed reliably by routinely available and potentially modifiable clinical variables. Seven risk factors accounted for up to 64% of risk.",nocancer
"Scale validation via quantifying item validity using the Dm index. While most validity indices are based on total test scores, this paper describes a method for quantifying the construct validity of items. The approach is based on the item selection technique originally described by Piazza in 1980. Unfortunately, Piazza's P2 index suffers from some substantial limitations. The Dm coefficient provides an alternative which can be used for item selection and provides a validity index for a set of items. The index is similar to that of traditional criterion-related validity indices. Criterion-related validity is used to demonstrate the accuracy of hypothesized relations of the measure with outcome variables of interest in research and practice. This method may be useful when the sample of items or persons is small, rendering more traditional approaches such as factor analysis or item response theory inappropriate. An example of how to use the technique is provided.",nocancer
"Reporting adverse events: Greek doctor and nurse attitudes. PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to elicit Greek doctors' and nurses' views about adverse event reporting. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: This is an exploratory study using an adverse events questionnaire administered to 209 doctors and 214 nurses in 14 major Athens universities and tertiary hospitals. FINDINGS: The paper finds that Greek doctors and nurses prefer a strictly confidential or conditionally confidential reporting scheme. Most doctors favoured disclosing department identity, while a nursing majority argued that it should remain unknown. When asked about the person's professional affiliation that, under a confidential scheme, receives reports and gives feedback, most doctors and nurses preferred the receiver to belong to their profession. Most medical personnel preferred the mandatory model or the discretionary model with a set of guidelines exemplifying adverse event types, while a nurse majority preferred the discretionary with a set of guidelines exemplifying adverse events. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: It is necessary to establish a strictly confidential, non-punitive reporting scheme that supports learning and knowledge and one that is separate from any disciplinary scheme. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The study indicates that culture, legal and patient complaint systems do not affect healthcare professional notions with respect to reporting adverse events.",nocancer
"Pancreatic solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm: report of a case in an elderly man with cytologic-histologic correlation. BACKGROUND: Solid-pseudopapillary neoplasms of the pancreas are rare and unusual tumors, occurring mostly in young women. Their cytologicfeatures are well described in textbooks; however, published reports still show some cytologic findings overlapping with pancreatic endocrine neoplasms and demonstrate the important diagnostic role of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration. CASE: A case of solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas occurred in a 61-year-old man; on cytology it was initially diagnosed as pancreatic endo crine neoplasm. The resection specimen in addition to immunohistochemical stains gave away the diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration remains a valid, minimally invasive procedure in pancreatic cytology. Tumor cells grouped around fibrovascular cores are the most reproducible cytologic finding in these tumors. Immunostains can play an important role when cell block material is available.",cancer
"Mitochondrial impairment in patients with Parkinson disease with the G2019S mutation in LRRK2. OBJECTIVE: The LRRK2(G2019S) mutation is the most common identifiable cause for Parkinson disease (PD), but the underlying mechanisms leading to neuronal cell death remain largely unclear. Impaired mitochondrial function and morphology have been described in different in vivo and in vitro model systems of early-onset PD (EOPD) as well as in EOPD patient tissue. The aim of our study was to assess mitochondrial function and morphology in LRRK2(G2019S) mutant patient tissue to determine whether impaired mitochondrial function and morphology are shared features in early-onset and late-onset PD. METHODS: Skin biopsies were taken from 5 patients with PD with the LRRK2(G2019S) mutation. Assessment of mitochondrial membrane potential and intracellular ATP levels as well as substrate-linked mitochondrial ATP production assays were all carried out on 3 independent cell preparations per patient. Results were compared to 5 age-matched controls. Mitochondrial elongation and interconnectivity was assessed using previously published methods. RESULTS: Both mitochondrial membrane potential and total intracellular ATP levels were decreased in the G2019S mutation carriers. Subsequently undertaken mitochondrial ATP production assays suggested that the observed reduction is at least partially due to impaired mitochondrial function. Mitochondrial elongation and interconnectivity were increased in the LRRK2(G2019S) patient cohort. CONCLUSION: Our results provide evidence for impaired mitochondrial function and morphology in LRRK2(G2019S) mutant patient tissue. Further studies are required to determine whether the impaired mitochondrial function is due to increased LRRK2 kinase activity or other mechanisms such as LRRK2 haploinsufficiency.",nocancer
"Description of extended pre-harvest pig Salmonella surveillance-and-control programme and its estimated effect on food safety related to pork. Salmonella in pork can be combated during pre- or post-harvest. For large slaughterhouses, post-harvest measures like decontamination might be cost-effective while this is less likely with small-to-medium sized slaughterhouses. In this study, pre-harvest measures might be more relevant. We describe an extended surveillance-and-control programme for Salmonella in finisher pigs, which, to establish equivalence to the Swedish control programme, is intended for implementation on the Danish island, Bornholm. The effect of the programme on food safety was estimated by analysing Salmonella data from pig carcasses originating from herds that would have qualified for the programme during 2006-2008. Food safety was interpreted as prevalence of Salmonella on carcasses as well as the estimated number of human cases of salmonellosis related to pork produced within the programme. Data from the Danish Salmonella programme were obtained from Bornholm. We used a simulation model developed to estimate the number of human cases based on the prevalence of Salmonella on carcass swabs. Herds are only accepted in the programme if they have one or less seropositive sample within the previous 6 months. In this way, the Salmonella load is kept to a minimum. The programme is not yet in operation and pigs that qualify for the programme are currently mixed at slaughter with those that do not qualify. Therefore, we had to assess the impact on the carcass prevalence indirectly. The prevalence of Salmonella in carcass swabs among qualifying herds was 0.46% for the 3 years as a whole, with 2006 as the year with highest prevalence. According to the simulation the expected number of human cases relating to pork produced within the programme was below 10. When the programme is in operation, an extra effect of separating pigs within the programme from those outside is expected to lower the prevalence of Salmonella even further.",nocancer
"The integration experience of hearing impaired elementary school students in separated and integrated school settings. Integration experiences of hearing impaired German elementary school students in separate educational settings (n = 31) were compared with those of counterparts at the same level in integrated settings (n = 26), and evaluated in regard to psychosocial behavior, semantic-lexical abilities, and communicative skills. Analysis of questionnaire responses and intelligence subtests showed that the only difference between the samples concerned perceived well-being in school, and favored the integrated students. Other percentages of variance are explainable by school type (10%), parents' hearing status (12%), and use of bimodal communication (11%). The integrated students demonstrated a higher level of integration experience, associated with fewer psychosocial abnormalities and better communicative skills. The results indicate that educational setting is not the only factor influencing students' perceived well-being. Other contextual factors, e.g., hearing status of parents and communicative skills, have a similar positive impact on integration experiences",nocancer
"Gamma Knife surgery for arteriovenous malformations in children. OBJECT: The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term imaging and clinical outcomes of intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in children treated with Gamma Knife surgery (GKS). METHODS: Between 1989 and 2007, 200 patients with AVMs who were 18 years of age or younger were treated at the University of Virginia Health System. Excluding 14 patients who had not reached 2-year follow-up, 186 patients comprised this study. Hemorrhage was the most common presenting symptom leading to the diagnosis of AVMs (71.5%). The mean nidus volume was 3.2 cm(3) at the time of GKS, and a mean prescription dose of 21.9 Gy was used. RESULTS: After initial GKS, 49.5% of patients achieved total angiographic obliteration. Forty-one patients whose AVM nidi remained patent underwent additional GKS. The obliteration rate increased to 58.6% after a second or multiple GKS. Subtotal obliteration was achieved in 9 patients (4.8%). Forty-nine patients (26.3%) still had a patent residual nidus. In 19 patients (10.2%), obliteration was confirmed on MR imaging only. Ten patients had 17 hemorrhages during the follow-up period. The hemorrhage rate was 5.4% within 2 years after GKS and 0.8% between 2 and 5 years. Six patients developed neurological deficits along with the radiation-induced changes. Two patients developed asymptomatic meningiomas 10 and 12 years after GKS. After a mean clinical follow-up of 98 months, less than 4% of patients had difficulty attending school or developing a career. CONCLUSIONS: Gamma Knife surgery offers a reasonable chance of obliteration of an AVM in pediatric patients. The incidence of symptomatic radiation-induced changes is relatively low; however, long-term clinical and imaging follow-up is required to identify delayed cyst formation and secondary tumors.",cancer

"Cementless total hip replacement using second-generation components: a 12- to 16-year follow-up. We reviewed 123 second-generation uncemented total hip replacements performed on 115 patients by a single surgeon between 1993 and 1994. The acetabular component used in all cases was a fully porous-coated threaded hemispheric titanium shell (T-Tap ST) with a calcium ion stearate-free, isostatically compression-moulded polyethylene liner. The titanium femoral component used was a Taperloc with a reduced distal stem. No patient was lost to follow-up. Complete clinical and radiological follow-up was obtained for all 123 hips at a mean of 14 years (12 to 16). One femoral component was revised after a fracture, and three acetabular components for aseptic loosening. No additional femoral or acetabular components were judged loose by radiological criteria. Mild proximal femoral osteolysis was identified in two hips and minor acetabular osteolysis was present in four. The mean rate of penetration of the femoral head was 0.036 mm/year (0.000 to 0.227). These findings suggest that refinements in component design may be associated with excellent long-term fixation in cementless primary total hip replacement.",nocancer
"The Netherlands: health system review. The Health Systems in Transition (HiT) profiles are country-based reports that provide a detailed description of health systems and of policy initiatives in progress or under development. HiTs examine different approaches to the organization, financing and delivery of health services and the role of the main actors in health systems. They also describe the institutional framework, process, content, and implementation of health and health care policies, highlighting challenges and areas that require more in-depth analysis. Undoubtedly the dominant issue in the Dutch health care system at present is the fundamental reform that came into effect in 2006. With the introduction of a single compulsory health insurance scheme, the dual system of public and private insurance for curative care became history. Managed competition for providers and insurers became a major driver in the health care system. This has meant fundamental changes in the roles of patients, insurers, providers and the government. Insurers now negotiate with providers on price and quality and patients choose the provider they prefer and join a health insurance policy which best fits their situation. To allow patients to make these choices, much effort has been made to make information on price and quality available to the public. The role of the national government has changed from directly steering the system to safeguarding the proper functioning of the health markets. With the introduction of market mechanisms in the health care sector and the privatization of former sickness funds, the Dutch system presents an innovative and unique variant of a social health insurance system. Since the stepwise realization of the blueprint of the system has not yet been completed, the health care system in The Netherlands should be characterized as being in transition. Many measures have been taken to move from the old to the new system as smoothly as possible. Financial measures intended to prevent sudden budgetary shocks and payment mechanisms have been (and are) continuously adjusted and optimized. Organizational measures aimed at creating room for all players to become accustomed to their new role in the regulated market. As the system is still a ""work in progress"", it is too early to evaluate the effects and the consequences of the new system in terms of accessibility, affordability, efficiency and quality. Dutch primary care, with gatekeeping GPs at its core, is a strong foundation of the health care system. Gatekeeping GPs are a relatively unusual element in social health insurance systems. The strong position of primary care is considered to prevent unnecessary use of more expensive secondary care, and promote consistency and coordination of individual care. It continues to be a policy priority in The Netherlands. The position of the patient in The Netherlands is strongly anchored in several laws concerning their rights, their relation to providers and insurers, access to information, and possibilities to complain in case of maltreatment. In terms of quality and efficiency of the health care system, The Netherlands is, with some notable exceptions (e.g. implementation of innovations such as day surgery and electronic patient records), an average performer when compared to other wealthy countries. It is too early to tell whether efficiency and quality gains will occur as a result of the 2006 reform.",nocancer
"Cardiopulmonary toxicity of different chemoradiotherapy combined regimens for Hodgkin's disease. The majority of patients with Hodgkin's disease can be cured by combination of polychemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT) that can produce late toxic pulmonary and cardiac effects which often remain at a subclinical level. The aim of the present investigation was to compare the late pulmonary and cardiac toxicity of three chemotherapeutic regimens combined with RT and particularly doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine (ABVD), vincristine, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide and prednisone (VEBEP) and ABVD with mechloretamine, vincristine, procarbazine and prednisone (MOPP). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated 147 patients suffering from Hodgkin's disease after a follow-up of at least 5 years from the completion of CT-RT. Seventy-eight patients were submitted to ABVD-RT, 36 to VEBEP-RT and 33 to MOPP-ABVD-RT. Patients underwent spirometry, 2D-doppler echocardiography at rest, cardiopulmonary exercise test on cycloergometer and determination of cardiac output by a non invasive method. RESULTS: Patients of the three different treatment groups showed tolerance to exercise, and oxygen consumption significantly lower than the predicted values but there were no statistically significant difference between the three groups. Nevertheless, patients treated with VEBEP and with MOPP-ABVD showed an ejection fraction at rest lower than those observed in the ABVD group and patients treated with VEBEP showed a cardiac output for oxygen uptake lower than those observed in the ABVD and MOPP-ABVD treatment groups. CONCLUSION: These data confirm that the combination of mediastinal RT with the more commonly used polychemotherapy regimens produce late toxic effects. The lower exercise capacity seems to be due to a combination of decreased cardiac performance and impairment of ventilation. The VEBEP regimens could be potentially more toxic for the heart, probably because of the higher cumulative dose of anthracyclines.",cancer
"Mechanisms of impaired regulation by CD4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+) regulatory T cells in human autoimmune diseases. A lack of regulatory T (T(Reg)) cells that express CD4, CD25 and forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) results in severe autoimmunity in both mice and humans. Since the discovery of T(Reg) cells, there has been intense investigation aimed at determining how they protect an organism from autoimmunity and whether defects in their number or function contribute to the development of autoimmunity in model systems. The next phase of investigation - that is, to define the role that defects in T(Reg) cells have in human autoimmunity - is now underway. This Review summarizes our progress so far towards understanding the role of CD4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+) T(Reg) cells in human autoimmune diseases and the impact that this knowledge might have on the diagnosis and treatment of these diseases.",nocancer
Vastus lateralis muscle flap for infected hips after resection arthroplasty. We evaluated the potential of a vastus lateralis muscle flap in controlling infection after resection arthroplasty of the hip. We retrospectively reviewed 119 patients with 120 chronic infections after resection arthroplasty treated with this procedure. The flap was fixed with Mitek anchors in the acetabular cavity. The mean duration of infection after resection before the muscle flap procedure was 6.5 months (2 to 13). The patients had previously undergone a mean of 4.9 operations (2 to 25). In all patients the infected cavity was the origin of the persistent infection. The mean follow-up was for 2.6 years (1.0 to 4.7). No patient had recurrent infection post-operatively and all had an improvement in the pain and better quality of life.,nocancer
"Detection of circulating free and immune-complexed antigen in pulmonary tuberculosis using cocktail of antibodies to mycobacterium tuberculosis excretory secretory antigens by peroxidase enzyme immunoassay. BACKGROUND: Decreased sensitivity has been a limiting factor of antigen assay for detection of tuberculosis. Assay of more than one antigen may improve sensitivity of an assay. AIM: To develop a simple, rapid and less-expensive serodiagnostic method compared to culture method for Pulmonary Tuberculosis. METHOD: A cocktail of affinity purified antibodies against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra antigens (SEVA TB ES-31, ES-43 and EST-6) was explored for detection of circulating free and Immune-Complexed (IC) cocktail antigen by microtitre plate Peroxidase sandwich ELISA. The assay was evaluated in 27 clinical sera of sputum acid fast bacilli (AFB) positive and 10 AFB negative but anti-tuberculosis therapy responded pulmonary tuberculosis patients and 20 normal sera as controls. RESULTS: Assay of cocktail antigen showed marginal improvement in sensitivity compared to assay of ES-31 antigen alone. The assay for circulating free cocktail antigen showed a sensitivity of 77.7% for AFB positive cases and 70% for AFB negative cases compared to assay of ES-31 antigen with sensitivity of 74% and 70% respectively. The assay for IC-cocktail antigen showed sensitivity of 77.7% for AFB positive and 80% for AFB negative cases compared to assay of ICES-31 antigen with sensitivity of 77% and 70% respectively. Specificity of antigen assay was found to be 90%. Detection of IC-antigen as adjunct assay improved the sensitivity of detection in AFB-ve but ATT responded cases. Peroxidase enzyme immunoassay of cocktail antigen showed a sensitivity of detection of 0.25 microg/ml and levels of free and IC cocktail antigens were 1.70 +/- 1.04 and 1.13 +/- 0.047 microg/ml in AFB positive patients' sera. CONCLUSIONS: Peroxidase enzyme immunoassay for circulating antigen was found to be a useful serodiagnostic assay and in particular in AFB -ve cases responding to ATT.",nocancer
"Sequence-dependent sorting of recycling proteins by actin-stabilized endosomal microdomains. The functional consequences of signaling receptor endocytosis are determined by the endosomal sorting of receptors between degradation and recycling pathways. How receptors recycle efficiently, in a sequence-dependent manner that is distinct from bulk membrane recycling, is not known. Here, in live cells, we visualize the sorting of a prototypical sequence-dependent recycling receptor, the beta-2 adrenergic receptor, from bulk recycling proteins and the degrading delta-opioid receptor. Our results reveal a remarkable diversity in recycling routes at the level of individual endosomes, and indicate that sequence-dependent recycling is an active process mediated by distinct endosomal subdomains distinct from those mediating bulk recycling. We identify a specialized subset of tubular microdomains on endosomes, stabilized by a highly localized but dynamic actin machinery, that mediate this sorting, and provide evidence that these actin-stabilized domains provide the physical basis for a two-step kinetic and affinity-based model for protein sorting into the sequence-dependent recycling pathway.",nocancer
"Constitutive mTORC1 activation by a herpesvirus Akt surrogate stimulates mRNA translation and viral replication. All viruses require cellular ribosomes to translate their mRNAs. Viruses producing methyl-7 (m(7)) GTP-capped mRNAs, like Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1), stimulate cap-dependent translation by activating mTORC1 to inhibit the translational repressor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1). Here, we establish that the HSV-1 kinase Us3 masquerades as Akt to activate mTORC1. Remarkably, Us3 displays no sequence homology with the cellular kinase Akt, yet directly phosphorylates tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) on the same sites as Akt. TSC2 depletion rescued Us3-deficient virus replication, establishing that Us3 enhances replication by phosphorylating TSC2 to constitutively activate mTORC1, effectively bypassing S6K-mediated feedback inhibition. Moreover, Us3 stimulated Akt substrate phosphorylation in infected cells, including FOXO1 and GSK3. Thus, HSV-1 encodes an Akt surrogate with overlapping substrate specificity to activate mTORC1, stimulating translation and virus replication. This establishes Us3 as a unique viral kinase with promising drug development potential.",nocancer

Congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM) is a rare developmental abnormality of the lung that has been associated with the presence of rhabdomyosarcoma, pleuropulmonary blastoma, and most commonly bronchioalveolar carcinoma (BAC) of the lung. Here, we report the case of an 8-year-old patient who developed KRAS mutation positive stage IV mucinous adenocarcinoma of the lung in association with CPAM. This case reflects the previously recognized progression of CPAM to malignancy and suggests that BAC arising in CPAM may take a more aggressive course than previously recognized.",cancer
"Early white discoloration of infantile hemangioma: a sign of impending ulceration. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between early white discoloration of infantile hemangioma (IH) and ulceration. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: A case series of 11 infants with early white discoloration of IH are described. An additional 55 infants with IH, aged 3 months, were evaluated retrospectively from a photograph archive to further explore the relationship between early white discoloration and presence or development of ulceration. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient demographics and hemangioma size, location, and subtype are documented. Sensitivity and specificity of white discoloration in relationship to ulceration are estimated. RESULTS: Ten of the 11 infants in the case series were girls (90%); all IHs were of segmental or indeterminate subtype. Average age at first ulceration was 2.6 months, with average age at healing 5.2 months. No intervention halted progression of ulceration. Of the 55 additional 3-month-old infants, 14 had white discoloration and 12 of these 14 had or developed ulceration (86%). When the hemangioma was either white or slightly white, sensitivity for predicting ulceration was 1.00 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78-1.00), with a specificity of 0.68 (95% CI, 0.51-0.81). In contrast, in infants with either slightly white or no white discoloration, the sensitivity for not developing ulceration was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.52-0.96), with a specificity of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.83-0.99), suggesting that a lack of substantial white discoloration early in infancy indicates low risk of ulceration. CONCLUSION: Early white discoloration of infantile hemangioma is highly suggestive of impending ulceration.",cancer
"Case study: a novel biomechanical approach for evaluating extended body armor systems. To combat the devastating effects of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), body armor that provides extended coverage has been developed. However, this extended coverage increases the armor's weight and may restrict movement. Throughout this case study, a novel technique to assess several armor systems was investigated. Four soldiers performed shoulder and trunk movements while wearing each of the six different armor inserts. Electromyography (EMG) was used to quantify muscular activity and inertial motion sensors were used to determine joint range of motion (ROM). Outcome measures included maximum ROM, integrated EMG, and the soldiers' subjective rankings. For the shoulder tasks, objective ROM and EMG measures were related to each other as well as to subjective rankings and armor material properties. Conversely, little agreement was found between measures for the trunk tasks. Results of this preliminary investigation indicate that combining shoulder ROM and EMG measures has the potential to provide an objective assessment of body armor systems.",nocancer
"Octreotide acetate is efficacious and safe in children for treating diarrhea due to chemotherapy but not acute graft versus host disease. BACKGROUND: The Common Toxicity Criteria of the National Cancer Institute evaluates diarrhea as an adverse event of chemotherapy administration. Acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) causes diarrhea in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients. Guidelines for treating grade 3 and 4 chemotherapy induced diarrhea (CID) include octreotide acetate, a somatostatin analogue. These recommendations are based on adult octreotide trials. Data on octreotide use for treatment of CID in pediatric oncology patients are limited. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of octreotide in the treatment of CID or aGVHD induced diarrhea in pediatric patients. METHODS: This is a retrospective review of 34 patients of average age 6 years who received octreotide between 1994 and 2008 for treatment of CID or aGVHD induced diarrhea. RESULTS: Thirty-eight courses of intravenous octreotide were administered. A complete response was achieved during 25/27 (92%) CID and 5/11 (45%) aGVHD induced diarrhea courses. A partial response was achieved during 4/38 courses, all in the aGVHD induced diarrhea group. No response was observed for 3 of the aGVHD induced diarrhea courses and 1 for the CID course. Octreotide was initiated at 2 mcg/kg/day and increased to a maximum of 9 mcg/kg/day. The mean total duration of treatment was 9 days. Common adverse effects observed were hyperglycemia, hyberbilirubinemia, nausea/vomiting, and abdominal cramping. CONCLUSION: In pediatric patients, octreotide exhibits 92% efficacy in treating CID and 45% efficacy in aGVHD induced diarrhea. Further studies to better characterize the starting dose and dose escalation algorithm for treating CID in children are required.",nocancer
"Safety and efficacy of long-term statin treatment for cardiovascular events in patients with coronary heart disease and abnormal liver tests in the Greek Atorvastatin and Coronary Heart Disease Evaluation (GREACE) Study: a post-hoc analysis. BACKGROUND: Long-term statin treatment reduces the frequency of cardiovascular events, but safety and efficacy in patients with abnormal liver tests is unclear. We assessed whether statin therapy is safe and effective for these patients through post-hoc analysis of the Greek Atorvastatin and Coronary Heart Disease Evaluation (GREACE) study population. METHODS: GREACE was a prospective, intention-to-treat study that randomly assigned by a computer-generated randomisation list 1600 patients with coronary heart disease (aged <75 years, with serum concentrations of LDL cholesterol >2.6 mmol/L and triglycerides <4.5 mmol/L) at the Hippokration University Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece to receive statin or usual care, which could include statins. The primary outcome of our post-hoc analysis was risk reduction for first recurrent cardiovascular event in patients treated with a statin who had moderately abnormal liver tests (defined as serum alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase concentrations of less than three times the upper limit of normal) compared with patients with abnormal liver tests who did not receive a statin. This risk reduction was compared with that for patients treated (or not) with statin and normal liver tests. FINDINGS: Of 437 patients with moderately abnormal liver tests at baseline, which were possibly associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, 227 who were treated with a statin (mainly atorvastatin 24 mg per day) had substantial improvement in liver tests (p<0.0001) whereas 210 not treated with a statin had further increases of liver enzyme concentrations. Cardiovascular events occurred in 22 (10%) of 227 patients with abnormal liver tests who received statin (3.2 events per 100 patient-years) and 63 (30%) of 210 patients with abnormal liver tests who did not receive statin (10.0 events per 100 patient-years; 68% relative risk reduction, p<0.0001). This cardiovascular disease benefit was greater (p=0.0074) than it was in patients with normal liver tests (90 [14%] events in 653 patients receiving a statin [4.6 per 100 patient-years] vs 117 [23%] in 510 patients not receiving a statin [7.6 per 100 patient-years]; 39% relative risk reduction, p<0.0001). Seven (<1%) of 880 participants who received a statin discontinued statin treatment because of liver-related adverse effects (transaminase concentrations more than three-times the upper limit of normal). INTERPRETATION: Statin treatment is safe and can improve liver tests and reduce cardiovascular morbidity in patients with mild-to-moderately abnormal liver tests that are potentially attributable to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

"Indications for aortic replacement. This monograph reviews currently accepted criteria for extirpation of the aneurysmal thoracic aorta. Presence of symptoms suffices to justify resection regardless of size. For asymptomatic patients, resection of the ascending aorta at 5 to 5.5 cm is warranted. The descending aorta can be watched until slightly larger sizes (ie, 5.5-6 cm). Marfan disease or bicuspid aortic valve encourages resection in the smaller region of these size ranges. A nomogram permits adjustment of intervention criteria for extremes of body size. A recently computerized aortic risk calculator automatically applies exponential equations for determination of yearly risk of rupture or dissection for individual patients (available at: http://aorta.yale.edu). Evolving modalities to enhance decision making include positron emission tomography imaging of aneurysm metabolic activity, measurement of mechanical properties of the aorta by echocardiography, and assessment of the biomolecular state of the aneurysm with the ""RNA Signature"" test.",nocancer
"Determination of vitamin A (retinol) in infant and medical nutritional formulas with AOAC method 992.06 using a modified extraction procedure: single-laboratory validation. The applicability of AOAC Official Method 992.06, vitamin A (retinol) in milk-based infant formula can be extended to specialty infant formulas, and medical and adult nutritional products with a few minor modifications to the sample preparation procedure. Currently, AOAC Official Method 992.06 is only applicable to milk-based infant formulas containing >500 IU vitamin A per reconstituted quart. When this method is used as written to test specialty infant formulas, vitamin A recoveries are low compared to results generated with alternate validated vitamin A methods. AOAC Method 992.06 vitamin A recoveries can be improved significantly in specialty infant formulas if the amount of potassium hydroxide used during the saponification step is doubled. With this one minor modification to the sample preparation procedure, AOAC Method 992.06 demonstrates acceptable precision and accuracy for the quantitation of vitamin A (retinol) in specialty infant formulas, milk- and soy-based infant formulas, and adult and medical nutritionals. Because increasing the amount of potassium hydroxide can cause emulsions to form, 2-4 mL aliquots of reagent alcohol may need to be added to some samples to separate the organic and aqueous layers during the extraction step. A single-laboratory validation of these modifications was completed. During validation, 15 different product matrixes were analyzed.

"HER-2/neu cytoplasmic staining is correlated with neuroendocrine differentiation in breast carcinoma. HER2 oncoprotein plays an essential role in breast cancer growth and differentiation. Determination of HER2 status contributes not only to predicting survival but also to selecting the patients for anti-HER2 therapy. HER2 protein expressed in human cancer cells often contains variant forms as well as the full-length wild-type form. In the present study, we investigated the subcellular localization of HER2 protein in 1053 primary breast cancer tissues. HER2 protein was stained by various immunohistochemical methods and studied by immunoelectron microscopy to confirm the intracellular localization. Thirty-four of 1053 specimens showed cytoplasmic staining of the intracellular domain of HER2 protein by the HercepTest and CB-11. In contrast, no immunoreactivity to the antibodies against the extracellular domain was observed. None of the 34 specimens showed amplification of the HER2 protein by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Subsequently, we studied the association of the cytoplasmic expression of HER2 with neuroendocrine differentiation. Interestingly, all 34 specimens had some positive signals of neuroendocrine markers such as synaptophysin, chromogranin A, neuron-specific enolase, and CD56. Although the result is preliminary, it warrants further study on the role of the cytoplasmic variant form of HER2 in breast cancer growth, particularly in the aspect of neuroendocrine differentiation.",cancer

"Zoledronic Acid improves clinical outcomes when administered before onset of bone pain in patients with prostate cancer. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate, in an exploratory analysis, the effect of zoledronic acid (ZOL) on skeletal-related event (SRE) incidence as determined by the bone pain levels at study entry. Bone metastases can undermine skeletal integrity long before the onset of symptoms. Treating patients before symptom onset might be more effective in preventing SREs and improving patients' quality of life. ZOL has shown significant reductions in SREs and pain compared with placebo in patients with bone metastases from advanced prostate cancer in a randomized placebo-controlled trial. METHODS: Patients from a placebo-controlled, Phase III trial of men with castration-resistant prostate cancer, randomized to receive ZOL 4 mg (n = 214) or placebo (n = 208) for </= 24 months, were stratified by pain or no pain at baseline. Bone pain was assessed at baseline, week 3, and week 6 and at 6-week intervals thereafter. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with >/= 1 SRE. RESULTS: ZOL significantly reduced the mean pain scores compared with placebo at 3, 9, 21, and 24 months (P </= .03 for each point) and reduced the annual incidence of SREs. Among patients without baseline pain, ZOL decreased the percentage of patients with >/= 1 SRE by 39% and reduced the annual incidence of SREs by 49% compared with placebo. ZOL delayed the onset of bone pain in those patients without pain at baseline compared with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: ZOL reduced bone pain and SREs compared with placebo in patients with bone metastases from castration-resistant prostate cancer, irrespective of the baseline pain status, and appeared more efficacious when initiated before the onset of pain.",cancer
"Advances in biodistribution study and tracing methodology of carbon nanotubes. Recent advances in applications of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) require thorough investigation of their in vivo behavior and fate. Biodistribution, as fundamental information for pharmacology and toxicology, should be intensively and systematically studied to accelerate the related researches. In this review, we summarized currently applied methodology in the study of CNTs biodistribution and the achieved biodistribution data. However, the currently used methods, including isotopic labeling, Raman spectroscopy and TEM investigation, can hardly reach a perfect balance of convenience and reliability. We compared the advantage and disadvantage of each method to show diversified choices for different purposes. Based on these techniques, available data suggest that CNTs have a general trend of high reticuloendothelial system (RES) uptake. But their distribution can be dramatically regulated by functionalization of the CNT surface with various molecules. For future biodistribution studies, developing convenient and reliable methods is highly required, and key parameters determining the behavior and fate of CNTs in vivo should be further explored and elicited.",nocancer

Our objective was to study the alterations of CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) T(regs) in HIV-infected SPs and to examine the role of T(regs) in the disease progression of HIV. The proportion of CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) T(regs) in peripheral blood of 24 SPs, 30 asymptomatic HIV-infected patients, 20 AIDS patients, and 16 non-infected controls was quantified using flow cytometry. HIV Gag peptide mix-induced IFN-gamma expression in CD8(+) T cells in whole and CD25-depleted PBMCs was examined to evaluate the function of T(regs) . The expression of CTLA-4 in T(regs) was also detected to measure the suppressive effect of T(regs) . HLA-DR and CD38 expression were measured to study the relationship between the frequency of T(regs) and immune activation of HIV-infected patients. The frequency of CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells in SPs was lower than in asymptomatic HIV-infected patients, AIDS patients, and normal controls (P < 0.05). T(regs) in SPs showed lower intracellular CTLA-4 expression than those of asymptomatic HIV-infected patients and AIDS patients (P < 0.05). The frequency of T(regs) significantly correlated with the percentage of CD38 expression on CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells (P < 0.05). Multivariate regression analysis showed that the CD4(+) T cell count was the strongest independent factor correlated with the absolute count of T(regs) , while viral load had the strongest predictive strength on the proportion of T(regs) . We conclude that a lower frequency of T(regs) and intracellular CTLA-4 expression of T(regs) was one of the characteristics of SPs that may have important clinical impacts for the prediction of the clinical progress of HIV infection.",nocancer
"Blended courses: the best of online and traditional formats. With the wide availability of educational technologies and the Internet, clinical laboratory educators are replacing some traditional face-to-face classes with online methods in their courses. This article summarizes current literature and practice for partly online ""blended"" courses. Blended courses can take advantage of the best of both online and traditional face-to-face instruction. The many advantages for educators and students include flexibility, convenience, and improved participation, however designing blended courses is challenging and time consuming. For optimal learning, educators should design a blended course by matching the appropriate methods with the objectives of the course. The pedagogy of blended learning is discussed and best practices are identified.",nocancer
"Uncertainty in the perioperative management of high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma among Mohs surgeons. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether Mohs surgeons' management of high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (HRCSCC) is uniform regarding radiologic nodal staging (RNS) and adjuvant radiation therapy (ART). DESIGN: A survey study of randomly selected, fellowship-trained Mohs surgeons. SETTING: An academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: American College of Mohs Surgery members who responded to an e-mail invitation completed either a survey regarding management of HRCSCC (n=117) or SCC with perineural invasion (PNI) (n=118). Participants totaled approximately 25% of the American College of Mohs Surgery membership. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) Percentage of patients with HRCSCC referred for RNS, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), or ART over the preceding 12 months; (2) top factors leading surgeons to consider RNS, SLNB, or ART; and (3) acceptance of ART for clinical scenarios of various degrees of PNI. RESULTS: Most respondents cited PNI and in-transit metastasis as top factors leading to consideration of RNS, SLNB, or ART. Otherwise, there was no consensus regarding use of, or indications for, RNS, SLNB, or ART. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of consistency between experts indicates that there is equipoise regarding indications for RNS and ART in HRCSCC. There is also wide variation in RNS and ART practices among Mohs surgeons who are specifically trained to manage HRCSCC. Clinical trials should therefore be conducted in these areas as there is no clear standard of care.",cancer
"Head and neck cancer: changing epidemiology and public health implications. Characterizing the epidemiology of head and neck cancers is challenging and has received limited attention in the medical literature. Traditionally, 80%-90% of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) have been attributed to tobacco and alcohol use, but with growing public awareness and tobacco control efforts over the past few decades, there has been a downward trend in smoking prevalence in the US. There is also emerging evidence that human papillomavirus (HPV) is responsible for inconsistencies in HNSCC trends, with oncogenic HPV DNA found in approximately half of oropharyngeal cancers and in a high proportion of oropharyngeal cancers in nonsmokers and nondrinkers. The risk to HNSCC epidemiology is that whatever gains continue to be made in tobacco control may become lost in the increasing numbers of oropharyngeal cancers due to HPV. The purpose of this review is to explore the changing epidemiology of HNSCC, focusing on how it has been shaped by health policy and advocacy interventions and how it will continue to have public health implications in the future, particularly in considering preventive strategies against HPV. Given that the majority of HNSCCs are the result of exposure to preventable public health risks, more focus should be given to this area.",cancer
"Preliminary report: the development of the NCCN Comparative Therapeutic Index as a clinical evaluative process for existing data in oncology. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) develops and communicates the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) to oncologists and other clinicians. The NCCN Guidelines are widely recognized and applied as the standard for clinical policy in the United States. These guidelines and related documents, such as the NCCN Drugs & Biologics Compendium (NCCN Compendium), are used extensively by public and private payors as the basis for the setting of coverage policies. Given the demand for comparative effectiveness (CE) analyses, as described and discussed in this report, the NCCN has begun work on a paradigm to integrate evidence-based CE analysis into the NCCN Guidelines deliberative process. This report presents NCCN's initial thinking on the use of NCCN expert panel members in developing a process that can be used to compare health care technologies (e.g., radiation modalities, chemotherapy regimens) in a formal, systematic way. Draft considerations are provided to stimulate discussion and feedback, particularly in the oncology community, as NCCN moves through processes such as methodologic review, validation of rating scales, and review of implications for public policy, toward finalization of an NCCN CE analytic paradigm.",cancer
"Mutations in GNA11 in uveal melanoma. BACKGROUND: Uveal melanoma is the most common intraocular cancer. There are no effective therapies for metastatic disease. Mutations in GNAQ, the gene encoding an alpha subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins, are found in 40% of uveal melanomas. METHODS: We sequenced exon 5 of GNAQ and GNA11, a paralogue of GNAQ, in 713 melanocytic neoplasms of different types (186 uveal melanomas, 139 blue nevi, 106 other nevi, and 282 other melanomas). We sequenced exon 4 of GNAQ and GNA11 in 453 of these samples and in all coding exons of GNAQ and GNA11 in 97 uveal melanomas and 45 blue nevi. RESULTS: We found somatic mutations in exon 5 (affecting Q209) and in exon 4 (affecting R183) in both GNA11 and GNAQ, in a mutually exclusive pattern. Mutations affecting Q209 in GNA11 were present in 7% of blue nevi, 32% of primary uveal melanomas, and 57% of uveal melanoma metastases. In contrast, we observed Q209 mutations in GNAQ in 55% of blue nevi, 45% of uveal melanomas, and 22% of uveal melanoma metastases. Mutations affecting R183 in either GNAQ or GNA11 were less prevalent (2% of blue nevi and 6% of uveal melanomas) than the Q209 mutations. Mutations in GNA11 induced spontaneously metastasizing tumors in a mouse model and activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Of the uveal melanomas we analyzed, 83% had somatic mutations in GNAQ or GNA11. Constitutive activation of the pathway involving these two genes appears to be a major contributor to the development of uveal melanoma.

"Oral contraceptives, reproductive history and risk of colorectal cancer in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition. BACKGROUND: Oral contraceptive use and reproductive factors may initiate long-term changes to the hormonal milieu and thereby, possibly influence colorectal cancer risk. METHODS: We examined the association of hormonal and reproductive factors with risk of colorectal cancer among 337,802 women in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition, of whom 1878 developed colorectal cancer. RESULTS: After stratification for center and age, and adjustment for body mass index, smoking, diabetes mellitus, physical activity and alcohol consumption, ever use of oral contraceptives was marginally inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk (hazard ratio (HR), 0.92; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.83-1.02), although this association was stronger among post-menopausal women (HR, 0.84; 95% CI: 0.74-0.95). Duration of oral contraceptive use and reproductive factors, including age at menarche, age at menopause, type of menopause, ever having an abortion, parity, age at first full-term pregnancy and breastfeeding, were not associated with colorectal cancer risk. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide limited support for a potential inverse association between oral contraceptives and colorectal cancer risk.",cancer
"Multicenter early experience with extended aortic repair in acute aortic dissection: is simultaneous descending stent grafting justified? OBJECTIVE: In acute type A aortic dissection, the extension of repair to downstream aorta has been controversially discussed. We present the early results of a multicenter study using a hybrid stent graft prosthesis. METHODS: Between January 2005 and January 2010, the data from 191 patients after combined proximal aortic replacement and antegrade stent grafting were collected in the database of the International E-vita open Registry. Of the 191 patients, 68 underwent surgery for acute aortic dissection and were included in the present study. Hypothermic circulatory arrest and selective cerebral perfusion were routinely used. Computed aortic imaging was performed for false lumen evaluation during follow-up. RESULTS: The in-hospital mortality rate was 13% (9/68). Along the stent graft, the rate of immediate complete false lumen thrombosis was 86% (51/59) and increased during follow-up (23 +/- 17 months) to 94% (46/49). Distally, complete or partial false lumen thrombosis was initially observed in 61% (36/59) and in 82% (40/49) after follow-up. The 1- and 3-year actuarial survival rate was 82% and 74%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Extended thoracic aortic repair of acute aortic dissection with a hybrid stent graft is feasible at acceptable early mortality and promotes false lumen thrombosis around the stent graft and below.",nocancer
"Global aging and the brain. Intrinsic aging of the brain and its relationship to age-related neurodegenerative diseases need to be understood as part of global aging, which results from gradual accumulation of a variety of kinds of cellular and molecular damage. While certain kinds of molecular lesions are particularly associated with specific diseases, there is substantial overlap between the pathways causing disease and those contributing to global aging. Growing evidence indicates that the global aging process is more malleable than used to be thought. This needs to be taken into account in efforts to improve health and retention of mental capital across the life course.",nocancer
"Adjuvant docetaxel for high-risk, node-negative breast cancer. BACKGROUND: A regimen of docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TAC) is superior to a regimen of fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) when used as adjuvant therapy in women with node-positive breast cancer. The value of taxanes in the treatment of node-negative disease has not been determined. METHODS: We randomly assigned 1060 women with axillary-node-negative breast cancer and at least one high-risk factor for recurrence (according to the 1998 St. Gallen criteria) to treatment with TAC or FAC every 3 weeks for six cycles after surgery. The primary end point was disease-free survival after at least 5 years of follow-up. Secondary end points included overall survival and toxicity. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 77 months, the proportion of patients alive and disease-free was higher among the 539 women in the TAC group (87.8%) than among the 521 women in the FAC group (81.8%), representing a 32% reduction in the risk of recurrence with TAC (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49 to 0.93; P=0.01 by the log-rank test). This benefit was consistent, regardless of hormone-receptor status, menopausal status, or number of high-risk factors. The difference in survival rates (TAC, 95.2%; FAC, 93.5%) was not significant (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.45 to 1.26); however, the number of events was small (TAC, 26; FAC, 34). Rates of grade 3 or 4 adverse events were 28.2% with TAC and 17.0% with FAC (P<0.001). Toxicity associated with TAC was diminished when primary prophylaxis with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was provided. CONCLUSIONS: As compared with adjuvant FAC, adjuvant TAC improved the rate of disease-free survival among women with high-risk, node-negative breast cancer.

"Apixaban versus enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis after hip replacement. BACKGROUND: There are various regimens for thromboprophylaxis after hip replacement. Low-molecular-weight heparins such as enoxaparin predominantly inhibit factor Xa but also inhibit thrombin to some degree. Orally active, specific factor Xa inhibitors such as apixaban may provide effective thromboprophylaxis with a lower risk of bleeding and improved ease of use. METHODS: In this double-blind, double-dummy study, we randomly assigned 5407 patients undergoing total hip replacement to receive apixaban at a dose of 2.5 mg orally twice daily or enoxaparin at a dose of 40 mg subcutaneously every 24 hours. Apixaban therapy was initiated 12 to 24 hours after closure of the surgical wound; enoxaparin therapy was initiated 12 hours before surgery. Prophylaxis was continued for 35 days after surgery, followed by bilateral venographic studies. The primary efficacy outcome was the composite of asymptomatic or symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis, nonfatal pulmonary embolism, or death from any cause during the treatment period. Patients were followed for an additional 60 days after the last intended dose of study medication. RESULTS: A total of 1949 patients in the apixaban group (72.0%) and 1917 patients in the enoxaparin group (71.0%) could be evaluated for the primary efficacy analysis. The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 27 patients in the apixaban group (1.4%) and in 74 patients in the enoxaparin group (3.9%) (relative risk with apixaban, 0.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22 to 0.54; P<0.001 for both noninferiority and superiority; absolute risk reduction, 2.5 percentage points; 95% CI, 1.5 to 3.5). The composite outcome of major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding occurred in 129 of 2673 patients assigned to apixaban (4.8%) and 134 of 2659 assigned to enoxaparin (5.0%) (absolute difference in risk, -0.2 percentage points; 95% CI, -1.4 to 1.0). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients undergoing hip replacement, thromboprophylaxis with apixaban, as compared with enoxaparin, was associated with lower rates of venous thromboembolism, without increased bleeding.

"Pure desmoplastic melanoma: a melanoma with distinctive clinical behavior. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the excision margin necessary for desmoplastic melanoma (DM). BACKGROUND: DM consists of 2 histologic subtypes, pure DM (PDM) and mixed DM (MDM), differing in extent of fibrotic component. We investigated clinical and therapeutic determinants of prognosis in these DM entities. METHODS: We reviewed 118 PDM and 124 MDM treated at our Institute over 25 years. Local relapse, distant metastasis, and survival were studied. RESULTS: Most (91.7%) distant metastases in PDM developed after 1 or more local recurrences; whereas distant metastasis usually (79.6%) occurred as first event in MDM. Overall mortality trends in relation to lesion-thickness-plus-excision-width differed for PDM (P = 0.014) but not MDM (P = 0.185). For PDM, 5-year crude cumulative incidence (CCI) of mortality was higher (40.0%) for thin tumors (</= 2 mm thick) excised with 1 cm margin than those excised with 2 cm (14.8%); CCI of mortality for PDM > 2 mm thick excised with 2 cm margins (13.4%) was similar to that for thin PDM lesions excised with 2 cm (14.8%). CCI of local recurrence was also greater in PDM excised with 1 cm margins. In MDM, mortality increased with stage but was independent of excision width (CCI: 29.4% for </= 2 mm/2 cm, 31.3% for </= 2 mm/1 cm, and 48.3% for > 2 mm/2 cm); a similar trend was found for MDM distant metastases. CONCLUSIONS: In PDM, limited excision width is associated with significantly greater local recurrence and mortality; treatment should be excision with 2 cm margins even for thin lesions. MDM behaves similarly to other melanomas; treatment should follow guidelines on melanoma management.",cancer
"A functionally conserved boundary element from the mouse HoxD locus requires GAGA factor in Drosophila. Hox genes are necessary for proper morphogenesis and organization of various body structures along the anterior-posterior body axis. These genes exist in clusters and their expression pattern follows spatial and temporal co-linearity with respect to their genomic organization. This colinearity is conserved during evolution and is thought to be constrained by the regulatory mechanisms that involve higher order chromatin structure. Earlier studies, primarily in Drosophila, have illustrated the role of chromatin-mediated regulatory processes, which include chromatin domain boundaries that separate the domains of distinct regulatory features. In the mouse HoxD complex, Evx2 and Hoxd13 are located approximately 9 kb apart but have clearly distinguishable temporal and spatial expression patterns. Here, we report the characterization of a chromatin domain boundary element from the Evx2-Hoxd13 region that functions in Drosophila as well as in mammalian cells. We show that the Evx2-Hoxd13 region has sequences conserved across vertebrate species including a GA repeat motif and that the Evx2-Hoxd13 boundary activity in Drosophila is dependent on GAGA factor that binds to the GA repeat motif. These results show that Hox genes are regulated by chromatin mediated mechanisms and highlight the early origin and functional conservation of such chromatin elements.",nocancer
"Birth control necessary to limit family size in tribal couples with aberrant heterosis of G-6-PD deficiency and sickle cell disorders in India: an urgency of creating awareness and imparting genetic counseling. OBJECTIVES: (i) To study the outcome of ignorance and lack of awareness about sickle cell disease and G-6-PD deficiency among Dhelki Kharia tribal families of Orissa, and (ii) to study the reproductive output in relation to clinical genetics and patho-physiological implications. METHODOLOGY: A random genetic study of screening for hemoglobinopathies and G-6-PD deficiency among Dhelki Kharia tribal community in Sundargarh district of Orissa was carried out for intervention during the year 2000-2004. A total of 81 Dhelki Kharia families were screened and six families with double heterozygosity for above genetic anomalies were encountered. About 2-3 ml. intravenous blood samples were collected in EDTA by disposable syringes and needles after taking informed consent from each individual in the presence of a doctor and community leaders and sent to laboratory at Bhubaneswar for hematological investigations. Analysis was carried out following the standard procedures after cross checking for quality control. RESULTS: There were 12 (about 52%) children out of 23 who were either suffering from sickle cell trait or disease in concurrence with G-6-PD deficiency in hemizygous/heterozygous/homozygous condition in Dhelki Kharia tribal community of Orissa. There were on an average 3.83 number of surviving (range 2-6) children per mother in families of G-6-PD deficiency and sickle cell disorders. The average number of children (3.83) born (range 2-6 children) per mother to carrier/affected mother was much higher than the average for India (2.73). CONCLUSIONS: It is very difficult to maintain the normal health of an affected child with aberrant anomalies due to exorbitant cost of treatment, frequent transfusions and huge involvement of economy. One of the implications of aberrant heterosis is its adverse affects on routine individual physiology and hard activities. It is suggested to limit the family size in carrier couples to avoid aberrant heterosis of hereditary hemolytic disorders in their offsprings.",nocancer
"Evaluation of metabolic characteristics and viability of lipiodolized hepatocellular carcinomas using 18F-FDG PET/CT. This study aimed to evaluate the metabolic characteristics of lipiodolized hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and the diagnostic accuracy of (18)F-FDG PET/CT in assessing the viability of lipiodolized HCCs. METHODS: Thirty-six patients (age range, 32-73 y) with 38 lipiodolized HCCs who had undergone transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) with lipiodol before (18)F-FDG PET/CT (2-434 d) and 55 patients (age range, 36-77 y) with 57 treatment-naive HCCs who had not been treated with TACE were retrospectively studied. All patients underwent hepatic lobectomy or transplantation within 1 mo after PET/CT and multiphasic contrast-enhanced CT. (18)F-FDG uptake by lipiodolized and naive HCCs was compared and correlated with tumor size, pathologic grade, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) concentration, and time interval between TACE and PET/CT. The diagnostic accuracy of PET/CT and contrast-enhanced CT in evaluating the viability of lipiodolized HCC was compared. RESULTS: Histologic examination showed 30 viable and 8 nonviable lipiodolized HCCs. Of the 30 viable tumors, 19 showed increased, 10 similar, and 1 decreased (18)F-FDG uptake. Of the 8 nonviable HCCs, 3 showed increased and 5 decreased (18)F-FDG uptake. Uptake by viable lipiodolized HCCs was correlated with tumor size (P < 0.05) but not correlated with pathologic grade, AFP concentration, or interval between TACE and PET/CT. In contrast, (18)F-FDG uptake by naive HCCs was significantly correlated with tumor size and pathologic grade (P < 0.05 for each comparison). When lipiodolized HCCs with (18)F-FDG uptake that was greater than or similar to that in the surrounding normal liver were considered viable, the diagnostic sensitivity of PET/CT and contrast-enhanced CT in the early postembolic period (<3 mo) was 100% and 94%, respectively, and that in the late postembolic period was 93% and 79%, respectively. The specificity of (18)F-FDG PET/CT and contrast-enhanced CT was 63% and 100%, respectively, in the acute period. Three viable lipiodolized HCCs with high AFP concentration were true-positives on PET/CT but false-negatives on contrast-enhanced CT images. CONCLUSION: After TACE, (18)F-FDG uptake in lipiodolized HCCs was not correlated with pathologic grade, in contrast to uptake in treatment-naive HCCs. (18)F-FDG PET/CT showed a high diagnostic sensitivity in assessing the viability of lipiodolized HCCs, with moderate specificity. This method may be useful in determining the viability of lipiodolized HCCs in patients with increased serum AFP concentration or normal results on contrast-enhanced CT images.",cancer
"Improving cardiopulmonary bypass: does continuous blood gas monitoring have a role to play? The CDI 500 (Terumo Cardiovascular Systems, Ann Arbor, MI) is an in-line blood gas monitoring device that has been used in clinical practice for over a decade. Few randomized studies have evaluated the value of this device with respect to improved perfusion management. We routinely use automated continuous quality indicator programs to assess perfusion management. The aim of this study is to investigate in a prospective randomized trial the role of in-line blood gas monitoring in the improvement of blood gas management during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) utilizing continuous quality indicators. Patients were randomized into two groups (Control, CDI). Patients in the Control group received our standard CPB blood gas management, with intermittent blood gas results. Continuous blood gas measurements from the CDI 500 were recorded at 20-second intervals, with the perfusionist blinded to these measurements. Patients in the CDI group received standard CPB blood gas management, in addition to continuous blood gas measurements visible on the CDI 500, the alarm system activated, and the data recorded. Perfusion management for all cases was guided by institutional protocols. One hundred patients (50 in each group) were included in the study. No significant difference existed between the groups on demographic, surgical, or clinical outcomes. Blood gas levels of patients in the CDI group were able to be maintained in accordance to protocol a greater percentage of the time, e.g., pCO2 management was 2% versus 20% (p = .008); this was most notable for differences between the Control and the CDI group for pCO2 > 45 mmHg (p = .003). Practice variation determined via statistical control charts improved for both pH and pCO2, represented by a decrease in the variation associated with practice. Continuous blood gas monitoring with the CDI 500 results in significantly improved blood gas management as determined by adherence to institutional protocols.",nocancer
"Concomitant expression of HER2 and HIF-1alpha is a predictor of poor prognosis in uterine cervical carcinoma treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy: prospective analysis (KGROG0501). BACKGROUND: In previously reported retrospective analyses of uterine cervical carcinoma cases, HER2 was correlated with poor radiation sensitivity and poor treatment outcomes and HIF-1alpha was found to be an indicator of poor prognosis. To date, no prospective studies have been performed to evaluate the radiation sensitivity and treatment outcomes of patients with uterine cervical carcinoma relative to HER2 and HIF-1alpha expressions. We conducted a prospective evaluation of HER2 and HIF-1alpha in cases of locally advanced uterine cervical carcinoma treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. METHODS: Between June 2005 and April 2008, 25 patients with locally advanced uterine cervical carcinoma were registered in this study, KGROG0501. Their clinical stages were Ib2/IIb/IIIb/IVa in 1/2/22/1 cases, respectively. Nineteen cases had squamous cell carcinoma and six had adenocarcinoma. HER2 expression and HIF-1alpha expression were analyzed using an immunohistochemical kit on pretreatment biopsied specimens. HIF-1alpha expression was studied using another commercial immunohistochemical kit on pretreatment biopsied specimens. The survival rates were compared between patients with and without positive HER2 and HIF-1alpha expressions. RESULTS: The 20-month survival of HER2(-) and HIF-1alpha(-) cases (n = 6) was 100% and that of HER2(+) and HIF-1alpha(+) cases (n = 4) was 37.5% (p = 0.0032). CONCLUSIONS: In this first prospective analysis of patients with uterine cervical carcinoma treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy, concomitant expression of HER2 and HIF-1alpha was suggested to be a strong indicator of poor prognosis. A novel therapy including molecular targeted therapy such as anti-HER2 and anti-HIF-1alpha may be worth considering in patients with concomitant expression of HER2 and HIF-1alpha.",cancer

"Infection with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV) among children with cancer in South Africa. BACKGROUND IN ADULTS,: HIV increases the risk of certain cancers known, or thought, to have an underlying infectious etiology; the impact on the risk of cancer in children is less clear. METHODS: Here, we report results of an on-going study at four pediatric oncology centers in South Africa in which children diagnosed with cancer are tested routinely for HIV. Odds ratios (OR) for the prevalence of various malignancies were calculated (with adjustment for age, sex, and center) for the children infected with HIV using all children with cancer and non-malignant conditions, but not infected with HIV, as a comparison group. RESULTS: Of 882 children with cancer, 38 were HIV infected (for 12 the HIV status was unknown). HIV was associated with Kaposi sarcoma (all 10 cases were HIV infected; P < 0.001) and with Burkitt lymphoma (OR = 46.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 16.4-130.3; 13/33). For non-Burkitt non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), 2/39 were HIV infected (OR = 5.0, 95% CI 0.9-27.0). No other cancer type was significantly associated with HIV, including lymphoid leukemias (OR = 0.4, 95% CI 0.04-2.9; 1/172). CONCLUSIONS: Only Kaposi sarcoma and Burkitt lymphoma were significantly associated with HIV infection although results for non-Burkitt NHL were suggestive. Notably, we did not identify an association between infection with HIV and lymphoid leukemias, for which an underlying infectious etiology has been suggested.",cancer

"Changes of meteorological factors and tick-borne encephalitis incidence in the Czech Republic. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to analyze the influence of short-term meteorological changes during the vegetation period on the incidence of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) in the 1990s, characterized by a dramatic increase in reported TBE cases in the Czech Republic and other European countries. Furthermore, the relationship between TBE incidence and meteorological conditions in the previous winter season was studied. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The TBE incidence data were acquired from the EPIDAT database of the National Institute of Public Health (NIPH). Analyzed were a total of 4637 cases reported in Bohemia (1994-2004). Meteorological data were from the database of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute in Prague and originated from 22 meteorological stations located in high TBE incidence areas in Bohemia. RESULTS: A linear relationship was found between TBE incidence and temperature factors in all the years under study. Lagged cross-correlation analysis (with the time lag corresponding to the incubation period from the infected tick bite to the onset of TBE symptoms) revealed a close correlation between TBE incidence and weekly mean air temperature with a lag of 1 to 5 weeks. When considering the previous winter period, the closest relationship was found between TBE incidence and the previous-winter frost index, followed by the minimum air temperature. CONCLUSION: A review is presented of the effects of the currently observed climate change on TBE incidence as compared with the data reported in the 1950s. Results of parallel analyses of other factors potentially implicated in higher TBE incidence in the 1990s lead to a critical rejection of the conclusion previously drawn by some authors that the collapse of communism and subsequent dramatic socio-economic changes might have a decisive influence on TBE incidence in Central Europe. The rise in TBE cases reported in West European countries where no such political changes took place confirms the refutation.",nocancer
"Cutaneous needle track seeding of mesothelioma diagnosed by fine needle aspiration cytology: a case report. BACKGROUND: Diagnostic and therapeutic procedures for mesothelioma require surgical biopsy or the usage of different-sized needles. Thoracic wall involvement along the surgical or needle tracks has been reported. CASE: A 57-year-old woman who had suffered from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma complained of dyspnea and left pleural effusion. The patient had been treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy and was in remission since then. Thoracentesis was performed using a 22-gauge needle; the cytologic diagnosis was malignant pleural mesothelioma. Within 2 weeks from thoracentesis, the patient complained of an erythematous swelling in her left chest wall, in the area of the needle track. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the swelling was performed using a 23-gauge needle; 2 smears and a cell block were prepared. Smears showed neoplastic cells in sheets and papillary configuration with the features of mesothelial lineage. Immunocytochemistry showed positivity for calretinin and vimentin. Cytologic slides of the former effusion showed an overlapping of the cytologic and immunocytochemical features. A diagnosis of chest wall involvement from mesothelioma was established and histologically confirmed. CONCLUSION: Chest wall infiltration is a definite risk in the management of pleural mesothelioma, and FNAC is a useful procedure for a timely diagnosis of this ominous complication.",cancer

We used 13,715 records of participants aged 25 years and older from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) linked to the National Death Index. METHODS: We specified all-cause mortality using the underlying cause of death in the death certificate. We calculated time to death from interview date through December 31, 2000, as person-years of follow-up using the NHANES III interview month and year. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) relating all-cause mortality risk for those with an allostatic score of 2 and > or = 3 relative to those with an allostatic score of < or = 1. RESULTS: After controlling for age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, and income, mortality rates were 40% (HR = 1.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11, 1.76) and 88% (HR = 1.88, 95% CI 1.56, 2.26) higher for participants with an allostatic score of 2 and > or = 3, respectively, compared with those with a score of < or = 1. The death rate associated with allostatic score for each racial/ethnic group differed with age. CONCLUSIONS: The allostatic score increased the risk of all-cause mortality. Moreover, this increased risk was observed for adults younger than 65 years of age regardless of their race/ethnicity. Thus, allostatic score may be a contributor to premature death in the U.S.",nocancer
"Pork safety: achievements and challenges. Safepork is a biennial international symposium for researchers investigating the epidemiology and control of foodborne hazards in pork. Current research is heavily weighted towards enteric bacterial pathogens for which development of reliable practical interventions for farmers has proven frustrating. In contrast, modern production practices have greatly reduced the risk of parasitic foodborne pathogens. Better understanding of host adaptation of emerging agents is important for assessing their potential zoonotic and foodborne risks.",nocancer
"Parathyroid pathology: hyperparathyroidism and parathyroid tumors. CONTEXT: Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common cause of hypercalcemia in the outpatient setting. Parathyroid adenomas are common, unlike other parathyroid tumors. This review presents a brief summary of current updates in parathyroid pathology. OBJECTIVE: To review parathyroid development and discuss issues in hyperparathyroidism and diagnosis of parathyroid lesions, including the application of immunohistochemistry and molecular biology. DATA SOURCES: Current texts, PubMed (National Library of Medicine) articles, and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center archives. CONCLUSIONS: Primary hyperparathyroidism is most commonly seen with sporadic adenomas, followed by hyperplasia, multiple adenomas, and carcinoma. Autosomal dominant familial hyperparathyroidism syndromes should be considered in the evaluation of patients with parathyroid lesions, particularly in association with parathyroid carcinoma. While the incidence of parathyroid carcinoma is quite low, it is seen with a greater frequency in those patients with hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome. Inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene HRPT2 can be identified in a large number of parathyroid carcinomas. Hence, germline HRPT2 gene mutations may reflect unrecognized syndromic patients.",cancer
"Antitumor effects and anticancer applications of bisphosphonates. Bisphosphonates are firmly entrenched in the treatment of metastatic bone disease secondary to several tumor types, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, and myeloma. More recently, an emerging body of preclinical and clinical evidence indicates that bisphosphonates might also exhibit antitumor activity. This expanded role for bisphosphonates in the adjuvant setting might have profound clinical implications in many cancer types, particularly in the context of prevention of bone metastasis. Increased understanding of the mechanistic basis of the antitumor effects indicates that these might occur via direct mechanisms such as induction of apoptosis and inhibition of tumor cell adhesion and invasion, as well as indirect mechanisms such as inhibition of angiogenesis. There is also considerable evidence to suggest that nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates might exert additive or synergistic interactions with standard cytotoxic agents. However, mature clinical data with bisphosphonates are limited and, thus far, provide conflicting evidence regarding the antitumor role of bisphosphonates, but have mostly been conducted with first-generation bisphosphonates such as clodronate that are not as effective as next-generation bisphosphonates. Several large randomized clinical trials are ongoing with the next-generation bisphosphonate zoledronic acid to prospectively confirm an antitumor role for bisphosphonates in various tumor types. This review assesses the current body of preclinical and clinical evidence in favor of an antitumor effect of bisphosphonates in different cancer types.",cancer
"The physician assistant teaching fellowship: A model for faculty recruitment. PURPOSE: the rapid growth of the number of physician assistant (PA) programs in the last two decades has resulted in a heightened demand for qualified and experienced PA faculty. Barriers to recruitment and retention of faculty include the need for diverse teaching experiences and the lack of available mentors. METHODS: in order to provide a structured experience for training potential faculty for careers as PA educators and to address the barriers to recruitment and retention of new faculty, our institution has offered a PA teaching fellowship since 1998. RESULTS: the teaching fellowship has met its goal of increasing the pool of qualified PA faculty, as nine of the 11 graduates were hired full-time into PA teaching and program administration positions. Curriculum projects developed by the fellows have been incorporated into our curriculum and have been shared with other PA programs. CONCLUSIONS: the PA teaching fellowship is a valuable strategy for developing teaching skills, promoting professionalism among PA educators, increasing the pool of available and qualified PA faculty, and overcoming barriers to retention. This model may be useful to other institutions.",nocancer

"Maintaining a high physical activity level over 20 years and weight gain. CONTEXT: Data supporting physical activity guidelines to prevent long-term weight gain are sparse, particularly during the period when the highest risk of weight gain occurs. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between habitual activity levels and changes in body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference over 20 years. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study is a prospective longitudinal study with 20 years of follow-up, 1985-1986 to 2005-2006. Habitual activity was defined as maintaining high, moderate, and low activity levels based on sex-specific tertiles of activity scores at baseline. Participants comprised a population-based multicenter cohort (Chicago, Illinois; Birmingham, Alabama; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Oakland, California) of 3554 men and women aged 18 to 30 years at baseline. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Average annual changes in BMI and waist circumference. RESULTS: Over 20 years, maintaining high levels of activity was associated with smaller gains in BMI and waist circumference compared with low activity levels after adjustment for race, baseline BMI, age, education, cigarette smoking status, alcohol use, and energy intake. Men maintaining high activity gained 2.6 fewer kilograms (0.15 BMI units per year; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11-0.18 vs 0.20 in the lower activity group; 95% CI, 0.17-0.23), and women maintaining higher activity gained 6.1 fewer kilograms (0.17 BMI units per year; 95% CI, 0.12-0.21 vs 0.30 in the lower activity group; 95% CI, 0.25-0.34). Men maintaining high activity gained 3.1 fewer centimeters in waist circumference (0.52 cm per year; 95% CI, 0.43-0.61 cm vs 0.67 cm in the lower activity group; 95% CI,0.60-0.75 cm) and women maintaining higher activity gained 3.8 fewer centimeters(0.49 cm per year; 95% CI, 0.39-0.58 cm vs 0.67 cm in the lower activity group; 95% CI, 0.60-0.75 cm) [corrected]. CONCLUSION: Maintaining high activity levels through young adulthood may lessen weight gain as young adults transition to middle age, particularly in women.",nocancer
"Primary extranotochordal cervical chordoma masquerading as a thyroid neoplasm: a case report. BACKGROUND: Chordoma is a rare malignant neoplasm of notochord origin that occurs along the craniospinal axis, and extranotochordal chordoma is extremely unusual. An aberrant origin of this neoplasm can pose diagnostic pitfalls. We report a case of primary cervical chordoma of extranotochordal origin clinically presenting as a thyroid neoplasm. The cytomorphologic features of chordoma and its cytologic differential diagnoses are discussed. CASE: An 82-year-old man presented with hoarseness of voice and difficulty in swallowing. He had a mass in the anterolateral aspect of the right side of the neck. Magnetic resonance imaging of the neck with contrast study revealed an ill-defined, contrast-enhancing tumor mass located in the right retrolaryngeal and parapharyngeal space at the level of C4, invading the perithyroidal soft tissue. Aspiration biopsy cytology of the tumor demonstrated epithelial-like cells with varied cytomorphologic features causing differential diagnostic problems with thyroid and soft tissue. However, the diagnosis of extranotochordal chordoma was established by the subsequent histologic examination of the excisional biopsy specimen. CONCLUSION: Since chordoma is capable of exhibiting a spectrum of cytomorphologic characteristics and can have cytologic features overlapping with other malignant neoplasms, a high index of suspicion is crucial to make an accurate diagnosis on fine needle aspiration biopsy. This case highlights the occurrence of a rare neoplasm at an aberrant site and the diagnostic challenges that can pose. However, awareness of the abnormal locations and characteristic cytomorphologic features of chordoma together with radiologic findings will usually keep the cytopathologist from making a wrong diagnosis.",cancer
"Adjuvant chemotherapy versus radiation therapy after radical surgery in high-risk positive node stage IB/IIA cervical cancer. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the addition of adjuvant chemotherapy will improve the outcomes of high-risk patients with Stage IB, IIA squamous cervical carcinoma with positive pelvic and/or aortic nodes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 127 patients with Stage IB and IIA cervical carcinoma treated with radical hysterectomy and systematic pelvic/aortic lymphadenectomy (RS) and who had lymph node involvement, confirmed at the final histological examination were enrolled from January 1987 to December 2001. All the patients received three cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) with cisplatin, bleomycin and vinblastine. The median patient age was 47.3. Seventy-seven patients had FIGO Stage IB1, 26 IB2 and 24 IIA. The results were compared with those obtained from a group of 136 patients with comparable age, stage and lymph node involvement, on whom radical surgery, systematic pelvic/aortic lymphadenectomy (RS) and adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) was performed on period 1971-1984. The followup period ranged from 7-13 years. RESULTS: Overall survival rate of the two groups (RS+AC) vs (RS+RT) at seven years was 69.3% and 59.5%, respectively (chi2 = 2.70; p = .10). Progression-free survival was 59.8% vs 50.0% (chi2 = 2.56; p = .10 ns). The best results were however obtained with the common iliac and over two lymph node metastases. CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant chemotherapy in high-risk patients for lymph node positivity did not produce statistically significant results in terms of overall and disease-free survival vs adjuvant radiotherapy; however, a group of these patients, approximately 10%, could receive benefit from the treatment.",cancer

"The role of computerized tomography in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in patients with negative ultrasonography findings and a low Alvarado score. BACKGROUND: We aimed to identify the role of computerized tomography (CT) in the differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis in patients with a low Alvarado score and negative ultrasonography findings. METHODS: Fifty-two cases who underwent appendectomy (December 2004-September 2008) were included. All patients had an Alvarado score of 4-6 together with negative ultrasonography findings; preoperative abdominal CT examination results were available in all patients. CT results were compared with intraoperative and pathological findings. RESULTS: The mean age of the cases was 31+/-4 years (range 11 to 71 years). The mean Alvarado score was 4.9. CT results were in favor of acute appendicitis in 34 of 52 cases. Of these 34 patients, acute appendicitis was confirmed by pathological findings in 31, whereas acute appendicitis could not be confirmed in the remaining three cases (8.2%). In 15 of 18 cases without CT findings of appendicitis, intraoperative and pathological findings were also in agreement; however, the remaining three cases had acute appendicitis. Based on the results of the recent studies, sensitivity and specificity of CT in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis were 91.2% and 83.3%, respectively. CONCLUSION: To avoid unnecessary appendectomies in suspected acute appendicitis cases with a low Alvarado score and negative ultrasonography findings, CT may be used as a complementary diagnostic tool.",cancer
"Bayesian zero-inflated predictive modelling of herd-level Salmonella prevalence for risk-based surveillance. The national control programme for Salmonella in Danish swine herds introduced in 1993 has led to a large decrease in pork-associated human cases of salmonellosis. The pork industry is increasingly focused on the cost-effectiveness of surveillance while maintaining consumer confidence in the pork food supply. Using national control programme data from 2003 and 2004, we developed a zero-inflated binomial model to predict which farms were most at risk of Salmonella. We preferentially sampled these high-risk farms using two sampling schemes based on model predictions resulting from a farm's covariate pattern and its random effect. Zero-inflated binomial modelling allows assessment of similarities and differences between factors that affect herd infection status (introduction), and those that affect the seroprevalence in infected herds (persistence and spread). Both large (producing greater than 5000 pigs per annum), and small herds (producing less than 2000 pigs per annum) were at significantly higher risk for infection and subsequent seroprevalence, when compared with medium sized herds (producing between 2000 and 5000 pigs per annum). When compared with herds being located elsewhere, being located in the south of Jutland significantly decreased the risk of herd infection, but increased the risk of a pig from an infected herd being seropositive. The model suggested that many of the herds where Salmonella was not detected were infected, but at a low prevalence. Using cost and sensitivity, we compared the results of our model based sampling schemes with those under the standard sampling scheme, based on herd size, and the recently introduced risk-based approach. Model-based results were less sensitive but show significant cost savings. Further model refinements, sampling schemes and the methods to evaluate their performance are important areas for future work, and these should continue to occur in direct consultation with Danish authorities.",nocancer
"Auditing psychiatric out-patient records. PURPOSE: Up-to-date patient records are essential for safe and professional practice. They are an intrinsic component for providing adequate care and ensuring appropriate and systematic treatment 2009 plans. Furthermore, accurate and contemporaneous notes are essential for achieving professional standards from a medico-legal perspective. The study's main aim was to investigate current record-keeping practices by looking at whether out-patient communication pathways to general practitioners, from letter dictation to insertion in the chart, were being satisfied. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: From current out-patient attendees over six months, 100 charts were chosen randomly, and reviewed. A pro-forma was used to collect data and this information was also checked against electronic records. FINDINGS: Of the charts reviewed, 15 per cent had no letter. If one considers that one-month is an acceptable time for letters to be inserted into the chart, then only 11 per cent satisfied this condition. Electronic data were also missing. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: It is impossible to discern whether letters to GPs were dictated by the out-patient doctor for each patient reviewed. Another limitation was that some multidisciplinary hospital teams have different out-patient note-keeping procedures, which makes some findings difficult to interpret. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The review drew attention to current record-keeping discrepancies, highlighting the need for medical record-keeping procedures and polices to be put in place. Also brought to light was the importance of providing a workforce sufficient to meet the out-patient team's administrative needs. An extended audit of other medical record-keeping aspects should be carried out to determine whether problems occur in other areas. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The study highlights the importance of establishing agreed policies and procedures for out-patient record keeping and the need to have a checking mechanism to identify system weaknesses.",nocancer
"Zinc and iron determination in serum and urine samples of thyroid patients using cloud point extraction. A simple and rapid cloud point extraction method was applied for preconcentration of trace quantities of zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe) in biological samples (serum and urine) of thyroid patients prior to determination by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. The metals in serum and urine samples were complexed with 1-(2-thiazolylazo)-2-naphthol and entrapped in the surfactant octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol (Triton X-114). After centrifugation, the surfactant-rich phase was diluted with 0.1 M HNO3 in methanol. For optimum recovery of analytes, the influences of the analytical parameters, including pH and amounts of complexing and surfactant reagents, were investigated. Enrichment factors of 66.4 and 70.2 were obtained for the preconcentration of Zn(II) and Fe(III), respectively. The obtained results showed sufficient recoveries (>98%) for Zn(II) and Fe(III) in certified reference materials (CRMs). The proposed method was applied to the determination of Zn(II) and Fe(III) in biological (serum and urine) samples and CRMs.",nocancer

"Costs related to medical treatment for common cardiovascular risk factors. AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the direct and indirect costs of selected cardiovascular diseases, namely hypertension (HT), metabolic syndrome (MS) and diabetes mellitus (DM) in the Slovak Republic. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study analyzes the data of 1,000 patients, randomly selected from NEMESYS database (10,300 patients). Average direct pharmacotherapeutic costs of hypertension per year were 257 Euros in men and 264 Euros in women. Costs of metabolic syndrome were 334 Euros in men and 321 Euros in women. Finally, the costs of diabetes mellitus were 392 Euros in men and 384 Euros in women. The most expensive pharmacotherapy was used in patients with a combination of all three diagnoses (HT+MS+DM), namely 452 Euros in men and 455 Euros in women. Indirect costs represent an even more serious financial burden. The highest indirect costs were in patients with diabetes mellitus, namely 5,227 Euros in men and 5,365 Euros in women. CONCLUSIONS: The study proved the assumption of increasing the direct pharmacotherapeutic costs in correlation with the increased severity of disease. The gender differences on the other hand, were smaller in patients with more serious conditions. The indirect costs represented the greatest financial burden, and were 13 to 17 times higher than the direct pharmacotherapeutic costs (Tab. 4, Ref. 17).",nocancer

"Gamma-secretase inhibitors induce erythroid differentiation in erythroid leukemia cell lines. BACKGROUND: Notch signaling regulates the fate of hematopoietic stem cells and leukemia cells. However, the role of Notch in erythroid differentiation remains unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined the effects of three gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSI-IX, GSI-XII and GSI-XXI) that inhibit Notch signaling on the in vitro growth and differentiation of HEL and AA erythroid leukemia cell lines. RESULTS: GSI treatment induced morphologic erythroid differentiation and promoted hemoglobin production. GSI treatment suppressed short-term growth and colony formation, while treatment with GSI-XXI promoted the growth of AA cells. The degree of differentiation induced by each GSI roughly correlated with the reduction in HES1 mRNA expression. CONCLUSION: GSIs have potential uses in differentiation induction therapy for erythroid leukemia in the future. Before clinical use, in vitro sensitivity tests should be performed because the effects of GSIs are diverse depending upon the combination of leukemia cells and GSIs.",cancer
"Pain assessment in people with intellectual or developmental disabilities. OVERVIEW: People with intellectual or developmental disabilities suffer from the same chronic diseases and conditions as the general population but are more likely to have physical and psychological comorbidities. This places them at higher risk for experiencing pain and for having more frequent or severe pain. Self-report is the gold standard in pain assessment; but people with intellectual or developmental disabilities often cannot provide self-reports. Pain assessment in this population is therefore challenging. People with intellectual or developmental disabilities are increasingly being moved from institutions into community-based settings. Therefore, nurses in all settings need to be knowledgeable about alternate pain assessment methods. This article provides an overview of pain and pain assessment in this population, summarizes the relevant clinical research, and describes one facility's approach to pain assessment of its patients.",nocancer
"Development and assessment of a physical activity guidebook for the Colon Health and Life-Long Exercise Change (CHALLENGE) trial (NCIC CO.21). BACKGROUND: We report the development and assessment of a physical activity (PA) guidebook called Step Up to the Challenge that is being used to support a PA behavior change intervention in a randomized trial examining PA and disease-free survival in colon cancer survivors. METHODS: Content for the PA guidebook was constructed based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). Expert judges (N = 51) included oncologists, rehabilitation practitioners, colon cancer survivors, and TPB researchers. All expert judges completed the Maine Area Health Education Center checklist for evaluating written health information. A subset of TPB expert judges (n = 11) also assessed the degree of match between the guidebook content and TPB constructs. RESULTS: Expert judges indicated that the PA guidebook achieved desirable attributes for organization, writing style, appearance, appeal, feasibility, and appropriateness. For the TPB assessment, all mean item-content relevance ratings indicated at least a ""very good match"" between the PA guidebook content and the TPB constructs. CONCLUSIONS: Our guidebook successfully targets the TPB constructs known to influence PA behavior change and contains suitable and appropriate written health information. This guidebook will be an integral component of the behavioral support program designed to determine the effects of PA on disease-free survival in colon cancer survivors.",cancer
"Oxidative stress and apoptosis induced by iron oxide nanoparticles in cultured human umbilical endothelial cells. Recent epidemiologic researches indicate that exposure to ultrafine particles (nanoparticles) is an independent risk factor for several cardiovascular diseases. The induction of endothelial injuries is hypothesized to be an attractive mechanism involved in these cardiovascular diseases. To investigate this hypothesis, the widely used iron nanomaterials, ferric oxide (Fe2O3) and ferriferrous oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles were incubated with human umbilical endothelial cells (ECV304 cells) at different concentrations of 2, 20, 100 microg/mL. The cell viability, the rate of apoptosis, the apoptotic nuclear morphology and the mitochondria membrane potential were measured to estimate the cell necrosis and apoptosis caused by the nanoparticle exposure. The stimulation of superoxide anion (O2*-) and nitric oxide (NO) were examined to evaluate the stress responses of endothelial cells. Our results indicated that both the Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 nanoparticles could generate oxidative stress as well as the significant increase of nitric oxide in ECV304 cells. The loss of mitochondria membrane potential and the apoptotic chromatin condensation in the nucleus were observed as the early signs of apoptosis. It is inferred the stress response might be an important mechanism involving in endothelial cells apoptosis and death, and these injuries in endothelial cells might play a key role in downstream cardiovascular diseases such as atheroscelerosis, hypertension and myocardial infarction (MI).",nocancer

"Intentions to use hypnosis to control the side effects of cancer and its treatment. Evidence suggests that hypnosis is an effective intervention for reducing distress, pain and other side effects associated with cancer and its treatment. However, hypnosis has failed to be adopted into standard clinical practice. This study (n = 115) investigated overall intentions to use hypnosis to control side effects of cancer and its treatment, as well as demographic predictors of such intentions among healthy volunteers. Results suggest that the vast majority of participants (89%) would be willing to use hypnosis to control side effects associated with cancer treatment. Mean intention levels did not differ by gender, ethnicity, education or age. These results indicate that in the general public, there is a willingness to consider the use of hypnosis, and that willingness is not determined by demographic factors. This broad acceptance of hypnosis argues for more widespread dissemination.",cancer
"Extinction kinetics for metastatic cancer stem cells. PURPOSE: Cancer Stem Cells (CSC) are hypothesised to influence tumour growth through their self-replication, cell loss, and differentiation into growth-limited cell types. A model for the random gain and loss of metastatic CSC is developed to investigate how the balance between these processes might affect metastatic efficiency, tumour involution and treatment response. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A stochastic birth-death model for metastasis was constructed for the replication and loss of CSC. The model was extended to account for single and sequential cancer treatments, with CSC repopulation. RESULTS: If CSC losses exceed gains, the metastasis would become extinct. The resultant extinction probability was greatest during a period of stochastic susceptibility; treatment could extend, or reestablish, this period. CONCLUSION: Random CSC losses, with 'seed and soil' selection, provided a mechanistic explanation for the involution of metastases, as well as for metastatic inefficiency. With such background losses, and the growth limitations of differentiated cells, a metastasis could take years to reach macroscopic size. The susceptibility period could be protracted, providing for a window for therapeutic opportunity. Metastases with a high background CSC loss would be more responsive to treatment than stabler metastases. Modulation of this loss could enhance the efficacy of conventional cancer treatment.",cancer
"Effects of breastfeeding in children of women taking antiepileptic drugs. BACKGROUND: Breastfeeding is known to have beneficial effects, but there is concern that breastfeeding during antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy may be harmful to cognitive development. Animal and human studies have demonstrated that some AEDs can adversely affect the immature brain. However, no investigation has examined effects of breastfeeding during AED therapy on subsequent cognitive abilities in children. METHODS: The Neurodevelopmental Effects of Antiepileptic Drugs Study is an ongoing prospective multicenter observational investigation of long-term effects of in utero AED exposure on cognition. Between 1999 and 2004, we enrolled pregnant women with epilepsy who were taking a single AED (carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenytoin, or valproate). We recently reported on differential AED effects on age 3 year cognitive outcomes. In this report, we focus on the effects of breastfeeding during AED therapy on age 3 cognitive outcomes in 199 children. RESULTS: A total of 42% of children were breastfed. IQs for breastfed children did not differ from nonbreastfed children for all AEDs combined and for each of the 4 individual AED groups. Mean adjusted IQ scores (95% confidence intervals) across all AEDs were breastfed = 99 (96-103) and nonbreastfed = 98 (95-101). Power was 95% to detect a half SD IQ effect in the combined AED analysis, but was inadequate within groups. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary analysis fails to demonstrate deleterious effects of breastfeeding during AED therapy on cognitive outcomes in children previously exposed in utero. However, caution is advised due to study limitations. Additional research is needed to confirm this observation and extend investigations to other AEDs and polytherapy.",nocancer

Patients with early-onset schizophrenia typically have a more chronic course of illness, greater cognitive impairment, increased negative symptoms, and more severe social consequences than patients with adult-onset schizophrenia. Misdiagnosis of childhood-onset schizophrenia is common, but certain clinical features, such as predominant negative symptoms and premorbid developmental abnormalities, can help to differentiate the disorder from other psychiatric disorders in childhood. Treatment regimens that include both pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions are needed to comprehensively treat children and adolescents with schizophrenia.",nocancer
"A human genome structural variation sequencing resource reveals insights into mutational mechanisms. Understanding the prevailing mutational mechanisms responsible for human genome structural variation requires uniformity in the discovery of allelic variants and precision in terms of breakpoint delineation. We develop a resource based on capillary end sequencing of 13.8 million fosmid clones from 17 human genomes and characterize the complete sequence of 1054 large structural variants corresponding to 589 deletions, 384 insertions, and 81 inversions. We analyze the 2081 breakpoint junctions and infer potential mechanism of origin. Three mechanisms account for the bulk of germline structural variation: microhomology-mediated processes involving short (2-20 bp) stretches of sequence (28%), nonallelic homologous recombination (22%), and L1 retrotransposition (19%). The high quality and long-range continuity of the sequence reveals more complex mutational mechanisms, including repeat-mediated inversions and gene conversion, that are most often missed by other methods, such as comparative genomic hybridization, single nucleotide polymorphism microarrays, and next-generation sequencing.",nocancer
"TS, DHFR and GARFT expression in non-squamous cell carcinoma of NSCLC and malignant pleural mesothelioma patients treated with pemetrexed. BACKGROUND: Recently, pemetrexed (PEM), a new generation antifolate, has been used for the treatment of patients with advanced non-squamous cell carcinoma (SQ) of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). However, no useful markers for selecting appropriate candidates exist at present. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tumor specimens were collected from 5 lung non-SQ and 8 MPM patients who underwent surgery and received PEM. Real-time PCR and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of the primary tumor were used to analyze the mRNA and protein expressions of thymidylate synthase (TS)/dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT), and to compare the expression status and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: TS, DHFR, and GARFT mRNA levels had a median value of 2.39, 1.70, and 1.40 in non-SQ samples of NSCLC patients. The TS and DHFR protein levels had a mean total score of 2 and 4 in non-SQ of NSCLC patients. TS, DHFR, and GARFT mRNA levels had a median value of 5.55, 3.73, and 3.52 in MPM patients. TS and DHFR protein levels had a mean total expression score of 1 and 3 in MPM patients. No significant correlation was identified between the expression levels of TS/DPD/GARFT mRNA and clinical response for the non-SQ of NSCLC and MPM patients treated with PEM. CONCLUSION: TS, DHFR, and GARFT mRNA and protein expression may not be useful markers for predicting clinical response in Japanese patients with non-SQ of NSCLC and MPM. Further investigations are necessary in order to develop biomarkers to determine the clinical benefits of PEM treatment.",cancer

"Phosphorylation of the NFAR proteins by the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase PKR constitutes a novel mechanism of translational regulation and cellular defense. Here, we describe a new mechanism of host defense that involves the nuclear factors associated with dsRNA (NFAR1 [90 kDa] and NFAR2 [110 kDa]), which constitute part of the shuttling ribonuclear protein (RNP) complex. Activation of the dsRNA-activated protein kinase PKR by viral RNA enabled phosphorylation of NFAR1 and NFAR2 on Thr 188 and Thr 315, an event found to be evolutionarily conserved in Xenopus. Phosphorylated NFAR1 and NFAR2 became dissociated from nuclear factor 45 (NF45), which was requisite for NFAR reshuttling, causing the NFARs to be retained on ribosomes, associate with viral transcripts, and impede viral replication. Cre-loxP animals with depletion of the NFARs in the thymus were exquisitely sensitive to the cytoplasmic replicating virus VSV (vesicular stomatitis virus). Thus, the NFARs constitute a novel, conserved mechanism of host defense used by the cell to detect and impede aberrant translation events.",nocancer

"From mininvasive to maxinvasive surgery in colorectal cancer: modem evolution of oncologic specialized units. In the last years a wide range of new technique offers the possibility to have R0 resection in colorectal cancer. We report our experience about Single Port Laparoscopic Surgery (SPL) for not advanced right colon cancer and about pelvectomy with cilindric Abdominal Perineal Resection (APR) for advanced rectal cancer. SPL offer mainly cosmetic advantages but also quicker recovery. No touch technique with adequate surgical margin and lymphectomy were respected. Operative time of SPL was 85-115 minutes, the incision was 5 cm long. There were no complications. Length of hospital stay was 4-6 days. With advanced pelvic cancer, pelvic exenteration with en-bloc resection is indicated. Then we propose a case of a 55 years old woman with a pelvic recurrence from a metastatic rectal cancer involving the right obturator fossa, the vaginal stump, the right ureter. Modern surgical technique give us the chance to offer the most appropriate oncologic surgical treatment.",cancer
"Irradiation-induced p53 expression is attenuated in cells with NQO1 C465T polymorphism. NAD(P)H:quinone acceptor oxidoreductase (NQO) 1 polymorphism is associated with various hematological malignancies, especially infant leukemia or therapy-related leukemias, which involve the rearrangement of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (EBV-LCLs) with either of 2 well known polymorphic variations of C609T and C465T were selected from our archives of EBV-LCL clones and studied the induction of p53 expression after DNA damage. Irradiation of cells with C609T/C609T polymorphism (NQO1 *2*2) did not affect the induction of p53 expression. However, irradiation of cells with C465T/WT polymorphism (NQO1 *1*3) resulted in attenuation of p53 and p21 induction. Our results suggest that increased risk of infant leukemia development in patients with NQO1 *1*3 polymorphism is partially dependent on the inhibition of p53 pathway, though further studies are needed to fully understand the pathological role of C465T variant in the development of childhood leukemia.",cancer
"The effect of minority status and rural residence on actions to control high blood pressure in the U.S. OBJECTIVE: We examined actions to control high blood pressure (HBP) and health-care provider recommendations for blood pressure control among adults by racial/ethnic group and rural/urban residence. METHODS: We examined data from 45,024 participants with HBP in the 2007 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey. We used multiple logistic regression analyses to assess the independent association between current actions to control HBP and health-care provider recommendations for blood pressure control by race/ethnicity and rural/urban status after accounting for confounders. RESULTS: Black people, regardless of rural or urban residence, were more likely to report reducing salt and alcohol intake, changing eating habits, and taking medications than both white urban and white rural adults. Black people, regardless of rural or urban status, were more likely to be advised to cut down on salt, reduce alcohol use, and change eating habits. Black rural adults were also more likely to report being advised to take medications than white urban adults, while white rural adults were less likely to be advised to exercise than white urban adults. CONCLUSIONS: Race/ethnicity and rural/urban status have a differential effect on actions to control HBP and provider advice to control HBP.",nocancer

"Fine needle aspiration cytology of ductal adenoma of the breast with intracellular mucin: a report of three cases. BACKGROUND: Ductal adenoma of the breast is a benign lesion that can mimic both the clinical and cytopathologic features of carcinoma. Benign breast lesions with intracellular mucin are extremely rare, and ductal adenoma with intracellular mucin has not previously been reported. Here we present three cases of ductal adenoma of the breast with foci of intracellular mucin. CASES: Three patients were admitted to Tokai University School of Medicine Hospital and underwent fine needle aspiration cytology and histologic examination by excisional biopsy or partial resection. Fine needle aspiration cytology was performed using a 23-gauge needle, and smears were immediately fixed in ethanol and stained as Papanicolaou preparations. Epithelial cells formed cohesive clusters, consisting of biphasic luminal and myoepithelial cells accompanied by apocrine metaplasia with occasional high nuclear atypia. All three cases showed intracellular mucin, in varying amounts, which led to their being overdiagnosed as malignant lesions. CONCLUSION: To avoid overdiagnosis of ductal adenomas as malignant lesions, it is important to recognize that both intracytoplasmic mucin and atypical apocrine features can be usual cytologic findings of this disease.",cancer
"A retrospective analysis of non-platinum-based first- and second-line chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. BACKGROUND: Platinum-based chemotherapy represents the standard of care for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) while non-platinum-based regimens are frequently administered in patients with relapse. A retrospective analysis of the sequence administration of these regimens in the first- and second-line setting was performed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The records of patients enrolled in the Hellenic Oncology Research Groups's randomized advanced NSCLC trials from February 1997 to September 2006 were retrospectively reviewed. The efficacy of non-platinum-based chemotherapy administered as first- or second-line treatment (n=94, cohort A) was compared to that of non-platinum-based first-line followed by platinum-based second-line chemotherapy (n=267, cohort B), and the reverse sequence (n=123, cohort C). RESULTS: The objective response rate (ORR) to first-line chemotherapy was higher in cohort C compared to cohort A (45.5% vs. 25.5%, respectively, p=0.002) and cohort B (45.5% vs. 21.3%, p=0.0001). The ORR to second-line therapy was 17%, 13.1% (p=0.349) and 7.3% (p=0.027) in cohorts A, B and C, respectively. Time to progression and the overall survival were comparable among the three cohorts in both first- and second line therapy. CONCLUSION: Platinum-based first-line chemotherapy improved response rate compared to non-platinum-based regimens; however, the overall survival was comparable, irrespective of the sequence administration of these regimens is the first- and second-line setting.",cancer
"The small cell variant of anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Anaplastic large cell lymphomas constitute a heterogeneous group of hematopoietic neoplasms that are characterized by immunopositivity for CD30 and the presence, in varying degrees, of large, pleomorphic ""hallmark"" cells. Primary systemic anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive anaplastic large cell lymphomas are a subset of this group. Numerous heterogeneous histomorphologic patterns have been described in anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive anaplastic large cell lymphomas, and all patterns tend to have a better prognosis than that found in anaplastic lymphoma kinase-negative cases. We provide a short review of the small cell variant of anaplastic large cell lymphoma to facilitate the diagnosis of this difficult-to-recognize entity, which may be confused with reactive processes, commonly presents with disseminated disease, and pursues an aggressive clinical course.",cancer
"Invasive micropapillary carcinoma of the colon in ascitic fluid: a case report. BACKGROUND: Invasive micropapillary carcinoma (IMPC) is defined as having characteristic pathologic features of small papillary cell clusters surrounded by lacunar spaces and is known as an aggressive variant in advanced stages due to the high incidence of lymph node metastasis. IMPC has been well described in other organs, including the breast, urinary bladder and lung but has been rarely described in the large intestine. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the cytology of colorectal lesion of IMPC in the English-language literature. CASE: A 64-year-old woman presented with abdominal pain, nausea and constipation. Ascitic fluid cytology showed adenocarcinoma with papillary features, and a colectomy specimen showed IMPC. The cytologic features of this case were characterized by small papillary clusters with a smooth surface showing peripherally located cytoplasm with a rare central lumen, as ""inside-out"" cell clusters; these findings suggested IMPC. Differentiation from adenocarcinoma of other organs may be difficult, but immunohistochemical profiles suggested a colorectal origin; it was positive for CK20 and negative for CK7. CONCLUSION: IMPC has a distinctive cytomorphologic appearance, and this entity can be suggested from ascitic fluid cytology.",cancer
"How and why to screen for CYP2D6 interindividual variability in patients under pharmacological treatments. Cytochromes P450 are members of a superfamily of hemoproteins that catalyze a variety of oxidative reactions in the metabolism of endogenous and exogenous hydrophobic substrates. Fifty-eight cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes belonging to 18 families have been identified in human cells; the corresponding genes are highly polymorphic, and genetic variability underlies interindividual differences in drug response. The polymorphisms of CYP2D6 significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of about 50% of the drugs in clinical use, which are CYP2D6 substrates. The number of functional CYP2D6 alleles per genome determines the existence of four different phenotypes, i.e. poor, intermediate, extensive, and ultrarapid metabolizers. CYP2D6 genetic variants include copy number variations, single nucleotide substitutions, frameshift and insertion/deletion mutations. This review reports some of the different methodological approaches used to screen for CYP2D6 variants and focuses on methods that have improved variation detection, from conventional techniques to more recent microarray technology and high throughput DNA sequencing. In addition, this review reports some results on clinical relevance of CYP2D6 polymorphisms and provides examples of variability in drug response associated with interindividual phenotypic differences.",nocancer
"Multiple myeloma precursor disease. Recent data indicate that multiple myeloma is consistently preceded by the precursor states of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering myeloma. Currently, multiple myeloma is a clinical diagnosis based on manifestations including hypercalcemia, renal failure, anemia, and bone lesions, whereas MGUS and smoldering myeloma are diagnosed based on laboratory abnormalities. Current clinical markers allow for more individualized risk stratification and counseling of these patients. However, there is a dearth of biomarkers and molecular imaging techniques capable of (1) accurately identifying patients with disease biology corresponding with high risk of progression; (2) elucidating the mechanism of transformation to multiple myeloma; and (3) forming a framework for development of targeted therapies. This case presentation and review discusses the current understanding of myeloma precursor disease and future opportunities for improving personalized management of patients with MGUS or smoldering myeloma, as well as the potential for developing early treatment strategies designed to delay and prevent development of multiple myeloma.",cancer
"Neural modulation tuning characteristics scale to efficiently encode natural sound statistics. The efficient-coding hypothesis asserts that neural and perceptual sensitivity evolved to faithfully represent biologically relevant sensory signals. Here we characterized the spectrotemporal modulation statistics of several natural sound ensembles and examined how neurons encode these statistics in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (CNIC) of cats. We report that modulation-tuning in the CNIC is matched to equalize the modulation power of natural sounds. Specifically, natural sounds exhibited a tradeoff between spectral and temporal modulations, which manifests as 1/f modulation power spectrum (MPS). Neural tuning was highly overlapped with the natural sound MPS and neurons approximated proportional resolution filters where modulation bandwidths scaled with characteristic modulation frequencies, a behavior previously described in human psychoacoustics. We demonstrate that this neural scaling opposes the 1/f scaling of natural sounds and enhances the natural sound representation by equalizing their MPS. Modulation tuning in the CNIC may thus have evolved to represent natural sound modulations in a manner consistent with efficiency principles and the resulting characteristics likely underlie perceptual resolution.",nocancer
"Extraovarian peritoneal serous papillary carcinoma: a case report. BACKGROUND: Extraovarian peritoneal serous papillary carcinoma (EPSPC) is a rare cancer closely related to ovarian carcinoma and characterized by abdominal carcinomatosis without an identifiable abdominal primary tumor. CASE: A woman presented with ascites. She had an elevated serum CA-125. Peritoneal carcinomatosis without involvement of the ovaries was found. Paracentesis of the ascitic fluid resulted in a positive cytologic report not further suggestive of the malignancy origin, balancing between a mesothelioma and an adenocarcinoma. The histologic and immunohistochemical study of peritoneal biopsy specimens resulted in the diagnosis of EPSPC. CONCLUSION: The combination of cytology, histology, immunohistochemistry and clinical data is a reliable method for the preoperative diagnosis of EPSPC, allowing prompt chemotherapy as surgery may not be indicated in most cases.",cancer
"Clinical development of the anti-CTLA-4 antibody tremelimumab. Tremelimumab (formerly CP-675,206) is a fully human IgG2 monoclonal antibody tested in patients with cancer, of whom the majority have had metastatic melanoma. Clinical trials using tremelimumab demonstrate that this antibody can induce durable tumor regressions (up to 8 years at this time) in 7% to 10% of patients with metastatic melanoma. These tumor responses are mediated by the intratumoral infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) as demonstrated in patient-derived tumor biopsies. Grade 3 or 4 toxicities in the range of 20% to 25% are mainly inflammatory or autoimmune in nature, which are on-target effects after inhibiting CTLA-4-mediated self-tolerance. The lack of survival advantage in the early analysis of a phase III clinical trial comparing tremelimumab with standard chemotherapy for metastatic melanoma highlights the importance of gaining a better understanding of how this antibody modulates the human immune system and how to better select patients for this mode of therapy.",cancer
"Faculty and student perceptions of the success of a hybrid-PBL dental curriculum in achieving curriculum reform benchmarks. The dental education literature identifies eleven benchmark reform agenda curriculum qualities. The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which the University of British Columbia D.M.D. curriculum was perceived by students and faculty as achieving these benchmarks and to note any differences in perceptions within and between the student and faculty groups. A WebEval survey consisting of twenty-one questions was delivered online in November 2007 to faculty members and D.M.D. students. The response rate was similar (~60 percent) for both students and faculty members. Comparisons were made between faculty members and students as well as within each group. For the faculty, we looked at the influence of appointment, focus, and teaching experience. For students, we looked at the influence of the year in the program, gender, and program track. Some differences (p<0.05) were identified within the faculty and student groups; however, there were many more differences between the faculty and the students, especially in areas related to curriculum redesign, collaborations with other health professions, preparation for independent practice, and creating a trust-based clinic environment. Faculty members were more optimistic about curriculum progress than were students. Improved communication of curriculum goals and explicit efforts at creating a safe and supportive learning environment could diminish these differences over time.",nocancer
"Treatment of partial-thickness scalds by skin xenografts--a retrospective study of 109 cases in a three-year period. BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study was to confirm the clinical expediency of using a particular type of biological skin substitute--porcine skin xenograft--in the treatment of partial-thickness scald burns. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Over a period of three years (from the beginning of the 2005 to the end of the 2007) 109 admitted patients with partial-thickness scald burns were treated with skin xenografts. The mean age of the patients was 7.6 years (S.D.: 15.3), while mean TBSA was 13% (S.D.: 8.2). RESULTS: The number of patients healed by the 14th day postburn or sooner and their mean healing time, the mean healing time for all 109 patients, mean hospital stay and number of patients undergoing surgery were all evaluated. Of the 109 patients, 78 (71%) healed within 14 days with a mean time of 9.6 days (S.D.: 3.2). One sample t-test which compared mean healing times achieved within 14 days with the value of 14 days established a significant difference (p = 0.0001). For all 109 cases the mean healing time was 15.1 days (S.D.: 11.6), with no significant difference between mean healing times and the value of 14 days (p = 0.3). The mean hospital stay was up to 10 days (S.D.: 6.7). Four patients (3.6%) received split thickness skin grafts with an average extent of 4.5% TBSA. The data obtained were compared with similar studies and other treatment options for this indication and were discussed. CONCLUSION: This retrospective study proves the clinical efficiency of using skin xenografts for the treatment of partial-thickness scald burns. Skin xenografts showed good adherence on the wound surfaces, decreased the amount of exudate and reduced pain. In addition, the risk of hypertrophic scar formation was lower when wound healing was achieved within 14 days.",nocancer
"Complete remission and early death after intensive chemotherapy in patients aged 60 years or older with acute myeloid leukaemia: a web-based application for prediction of outcomes. BACKGROUND: About 50% of patients (age >/=60 years) who have acute myeloid leukaemia and are otherwise medically healthy (ie, able to undergo intensive chemotherapy) achieve a complete remission (CR) after intensive chemotherapy, but with a substantially increased risk of early death (ED) compared with younger patients. We verified the association of standard clinical and laboratory variables with CR and ED and developed a web-based application for risk assessment of intensive chemotherapy in these patients. METHODS: Multivariate regression analysis was used to develop risk scores with or without knowledge of the cytogenetic and molecular risk profiles for a cohort of 1406 patients (aged >/=60 years) with acute myeloid leukaemia, but otherwise medically healthy, who were treated with two courses of intensive induction chemotherapy (tioguanine, standard-dose cytarabine, and daunorubicin followed by high-dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone; or with high-dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone in the first and second induction courses) in the German Acute Myeloid Leukaemia Cooperative Group 1999 study. Risk prediction was validated in an independent cohort of 801 patients (aged >60 years) with acute myeloid leukaemia who were given two courses of cytarabine and daunorubicin in the Acute Myeloid Leukaemia 1996 study. FINDINGS: Body temperature, age, de-novo leukaemia versus leukaemia secondary to cytotoxic treatment or an antecedent haematological disease, haemoglobin, platelet count, fibrinogen, and serum concentration of lactate dehydrogenase were significantly associated with CR or ED. The probability of CR with knowledge of cytogenetic and molecular risk (score 1) was from 12% to 91%, and without knowledge (score 2) from 21% to 80%. The predicted risk of ED was from 6% to 69% for score 1 and from 7% to 63% for score 2. The predictive power of the risk scores was confirmed in the independent patient cohort (CR score 1, from 10% to 91%; CR score 2, from 16% to 80%; ED score 1, from 6% to 69%; and ED score 2, from 7% to 61%). INTERPRETATION: The scores for acute myeloid leukaemia can be used to predict the probability of CR and the risk of ED in older patients with acute myeloid leukaemia, but otherwise medically healthy, for whom intensive induction chemotherapy is planned. This information can help physicians with difficult decisions for treatment of these patients. FUNDING: Deutsche Krebshilfe and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.",cancer
"It is not just assisted circulation, hypothermic arrest, or clamp and sew. We have surgically treated 771 patients for thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms since 1983. Our primary effort has been to develop experimentally validated strategies to reduce paraplegia, renal failure, and mortality in these high-risk patients. This approach has led to a spinal cord protection protocol that has reduced paraplegia risk by 80% (observed/expected ratio = 0.19) with the use of cerebral spinal fluid drainage, moderate hypothermia (31 degrees C-33 degrees C), endorphin receptor antagonist (naloxone), and thiopental burst suppression while optimizing mean arterial pressure (> 90 mm Hg) and cardiac index. The elective mortality rate is 2.80% (17% for acute patients), and with rapid renal cooling for renal protection, only 0.88% required permanent dialysis. These results were achieved without the use of assisted circulation. We have reattached intercostal arteries since 2005 using preoperative magnetic resonance angiographic localization, but it remains unclear whether intercostal reimplantation reduces paraplegia risk, as we had initially proposed. We strongly believe that a consistent anesthetic and postoperative care protocol uniformly built and applied around these principles greatly enhances our surgical outcomes. We also show that improved outcomes with assisted circulation and hypothermic arrest in treatment of thoracoabdominal aortic disease follow similar principles of spinal cord and end-organ protection.",nocancer
"Fine needle aspiration biopsy for the diagnosis of thymoma metastatic to the breast: a case report. BACKGROUND: Extrathoracic metastases of thymomas are extremely rare, with only 9 documented cases in the cytologic literature, and a thymoma metastasis to the breast has not been reported before. Here we report the cytologic findings on fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) for the diagnosis of a case of thymoma metastatic to the breast. CASE: A 73-year-old woman presented with a palpable mass in the right breast. A sonogram revealed a discrete, hypoechoic nodule in the upper inner quadrant of the breast. She had a history of mediastinal thymoma 2 years earlier, which was treated with chemotherapy because of inoperability. FNAB was performed: the cytologic specimen showed epithelial cell clusters with a few entrapped lymphocytes, suggestive of metastatic thymoma. However, the differential diagnosis also included a primary malignancy such as poorly differentiated ductal carcinoma or medullary carcinoma of the breast. Excisional biopsy with additional immunohistochemical staining confirmed the thymoma metastasis. CONCLUSION: An FNAB-based diagnosis of this rare entity can be an appropriate, simple and minimally invasive procedure in the right clinical setting and with the appropriate patient history.",cancer
"Induction of gastric cancer cell adhesion through transforming growth factor-beta1-mediated peritoneal fibrosis. BACKGROUND: Peritoneal dissemination is one of the main causes of death in gastric cancer patients. Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), one of the most potent fibrotic stimuli for mesothelial cells, may play a key role in this processing. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the effects of TGF-beta1 on regulation of gastric cancer adhesion to mesothelial cells. METHODS: Peritoneal tissues and peritoneal wash fluid were obtained for hematoxylin and eosin staining or ELISA to measure fibrosis and TGF-beta1 levels, respectively. The peritoneal mesothelial cell line, HMrSV5, was used to determine the role of TGF-beta1 in regulation of gastric cancer cell adhesion to mesothelial cells and expression of collagen, fibronectin, and Smad 2/3 by using adhesion assay, western blot, and RT-PCR. RESULTS: The data showed that TGF-beta1 treatment was able to induce collagen III and fibronectin expression in the mesothelial cells, which was associated with an increased adhesion ability of gastric cancer cells, but knockdown of minimal sites of cell binding domain of extracellular matrix can partially inhibit these effects. CONCLUSION: Peritoneal fibrosis induced by TGF-beta1 may provide a favorable environment for the dissemination of gastric cancer.",cancer

In this retrospective analysis, all patients (n=714; male=590; female=124 and female male ratio = 1: 4.76) came to Pulsar, a sleep laboratory of Kolkata, for polysomnography during ten years period were analyzed. More than half (62.46%) cases were between 41-60 years and 14.43% cases between 61-80 years age group. Fifty-two percent cases were referred by pulmonologists, followed by internist (15%), and 7% cases were self referred. Though obstructive sleep apnea was responsible for increased cardiovascular mortality and resistant hypertension, only 4% cases were referred by cardiologists. We observed hypertension as co-morbidity in 52.63% cases and ischemic heart disease in 22.83% cases. Snoring was the presenting complain in 98.88% cases, chocking was present in 48.88% cases and excessive daytime sleepiness was found in 96.64% cases. Females showed comparatively higher frequency of sleep disordered breathing than males with increasing basal metabolic rate. Nocturnal fall of SPO2 below 90% was observed in 86.97% of study population. We found abnormal respiratory disturbance index (> 5/hr of sleep) in 84.59% of our patients, normal respiratory disturbance index (< or = 5/hr of sleep) in 9.94% cases and isolated nocturnal hypoxemia in 5.46% cases (74.36% of the last category having obstructive airway disease). Snoring with respiratory disturbance index (RDI) < or = 5/hr was observed in 102 cases, of them 81.37% had simple snoring without significant arousal whereas 18.63% had multiple sleep fragmentation. We estimated that 84.06% of males, 87.10% of females and 84.59% of study population had obstructive sleep apnea. Split night polysomnography was performed in 362 cases, and of them 15.47% cases could not tolerate continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) due to local or psychological reasons. In the present one time split-night CPAP titration study, we could not correct OSA in 19.06% subjects. Inadequate correction of hypoxemia due to co-morbid condition like COPD, asthma, obesity, hypothyroidism was the main responsible factor (49.28%). Treatment with CPAP was effective in 68.23% cases in first attempt. More than half of the cases (62.42%) required 10 cm of H20 or less CPAP.",nocancer
"Risk of colorectal cancer in men on long-term androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer. BACKGROUND: Androgen deprivation with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists or orchiectomy is a common but controversial treatment for prostate cancer. Uncertainties remain about its use, particularly with increasing recognition of serious side effects. In animal studies, androgens protect against colonic carcinogenesis, suggesting that androgen deprivation may increase the risk of colorectal cancer. METHODS: We identified 107 859 men in the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database who were diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1993 through 2002, with follow-up available through 2004. The primary outcome was development of colorectal cancer, determined from SEER files on second primary cancers. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the influence of androgen deprivation on the outcome, adjusted for patient and prostate cancer characteristics. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Men who had orchiectomies had the highest unadjusted incidence rate of colorectal cancer (6.3 per 1000 person-years; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.3 to 7.5), followed by men who had GnRH agonist therapy (4.4 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI = 4.0 to 4.9), and men who had no androgen deprivation (3.7 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI = 3.5 to 3.9). After adjustment for patient and prostate cancer characteristics, there was a statistically significant dose-response effect (P(trend) = .010) with an increasing risk of colorectal cancer associated with increasing duration of androgen deprivation. Compared with the absence of these treatments, there was an increased risk of colorectal cancer associated with use of GnRH agonist therapy for 25 months or longer (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.12 to 1.53) or with orchiectomy (HR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.14 to 1.66). CONCLUSION: Long-term androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer.",cancer
"American Pediatric Surgical Association New Technology Committee review on video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for childhood cancer. BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Although the use of minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques for children with cancer is being practiced by some, its role remains unclearly defined. The purpose of this review was to describe the current literature on MIS for thoracic and mediastinal lesions in children. METHODS: We performed a literature search for English studies that evaluated MIS techniques for biopsy or resection in children with suspected or established cancer. Only studies with greater than 20 patients were included in the review. RESULTS: Ten studies were included for review. Each represented institutional retrospective reviews of experience. Seven were single-institution studies, and 3 were multi-institutional. There were no prospective nor randomized identified. CONCLUSIONS: Based on primarily retrospective and observational data, the use of MIS for children with cancer who have pulmonary and mediastinal lesions seems to be effective and safe. Ideally, prospective studies are needed to evaluate this further.",cancer
"A positive relationship between filamin and VEGF in patients with lung cancer. Induction of angiogenic responses by multiple factors, a crucial step in tumor growth and metastasis, is not completely understood. Recently, involvement of the cytoskeletal actin-binding proteins in angiogenesis has been suggested as a target for anti-neovascular cancer therapy in vitro. In this study, the expression of filamin A (FLNA) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in paraffin-embedded tumor samples from patients with well-characterized lung tumors was immunohistochemically analyzed and compared with clinical variables and survival outcome. A positive expression of FLNA and VEGF was detected in the cytoplasm of tumor cells in 66 (48.2%) and 69 (50.4%) of the 137 patients with lung cancer, respectively (p<0.0001). A significant difference was observed between FLNA expression and VEGF expression. Although our findings do not suggest that the expression of FLNA alone plays an independent prognostic role, the angiogenesis pathway mediated by FLNA appears to be responsible for controlling the growth of lung tumors.",cancer
"CXCL12-CXCR4 signalling axis confers gemcitabine resistance to pancreatic cancer cells: a novel target for therapy. BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer cells are highly resistant to drug therapy; however, underlying causes remain largely unknown. We hypothesised that the activation of CXCL12-CXCR4 signalling confers drug resistance to pancreatic cancer cells by potentiating survival. CXCR4 is overexpressed in precancerous/malignant pancreatic lesions and cancer stem cells, and implicated in its pathogenesis. METHODS: Effect of CXCR4 activation by CXCL12 on restricting the gemcitabine-induced cytotoxicity and stimulating the survival signalling was examined in pancreatic cancer cells by MTT, DNA laddering, caspase activity, immunoblot, and promoter-reporter assays. Subsequently, we examined the effect of CXCR4 antagonist, AMD3100, in abrogating the rescue effect of activated CXCL12-CXCR4 signalling. RESULTS: The pancreatic cancer cells treated with gemcitabine exhibited reduced cytotoxicity in the presence of CXCL12 as compared with the cells treated with drug alone. CXCL12 induced the activation of FAK, ERK, and Akt signalling pathways, enhanced transcriptional activities of beta-catenin and NF-kappaB, and expression of survival proteins. AMD3100 arrested the CXCL12-induced pancreatic cancer cell growth and drug resistance. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate, for the first time, a role of CXCL12-CXCR4 signalling axis in conferring drug resistance to pancreatic cancer cells and suggest that it could serve as a novel therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer therapy, alone and in combination with the cytotoxic drug.",cancer
"Circadian integration of metabolism and energetics. Circadian clocks align behavioral and biochemical processes with the day/night cycle. Nearly all vertebrate cells possess self-sustained clocks that couple endogenous rhythms with changes in cellular environment. Genetic disruption of clock genes in mice perturbs metabolic functions of specific tissues at distinct phases of the sleep/wake cycle. Circadian desynchrony, a characteristic of shift work and sleep disruption in humans, also leads to metabolic pathologies. Here, we review advances in understanding the interrelationship among circadian disruption, sleep deprivation, obesity, and diabetes and implications for rational therapeutics for these conditions.",nocancer
"Significant association between polymorphism of the erythropoietin gene promoter and myelodysplastic syndrome. BACKGROUND: Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) may be induced by certain mutagenic environmental or chemotherapeutic toxins; however, the role of susceptibility genes remains unclear. The G/G genotype of the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1617640 in the erythropoietin (EPO) promoter has been shown to be associated with decreased EPO expression. We examined the association of rs1617640 genotype with MDS. METHODS: We genotyped the EPO rS1617640 SNP in 189 patients with MDS, 257 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 106 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 97 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 353 with chronic myeloid leukemia, and 95 healthy controls. RESULTS: The G/G genotype was significantly more common in MDS patients (47/187; 25.1%) than in controls (6/95; 6.3%) or in patients with other leukemias (101/813; 12.4%) (all P < 0.001). Individuals with the G/G genotype were more likely than those with other genotypes to have MDS (odd ratio = 4.98; 95% CI = 2.04-12.13). Clinical and follow up data were available for 112 MDS patients and 186 AML patients. There was no correlation between EPO promoter genotype and response to therapy or overall survival in MDS or AML. In the MDS group, the GG genotype was significantly associated with shorter complete remission duration, as compared with the TT genotype (P = 0.03). Time to neutrophils recovery after therapy was significantly longer in MDS patients with the G/G genotype (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a strong association between the rs1617640 G/G genotype and MDS. Further studies are warranted to investigate the utility of screening for this marker in individuals exposed to environmental toxins or chemotherapy.",cancer
"Atlas occipitalization in a supersonic fighter pilot involved in a midair collision: a case report. We report a case of a midair collision between two F16 fighter aircraft, in which one pilot survived and the other was ejected upon impact and his remains recovered from sea. In autopsy, no patholgy was detected, other than the expected evidence of mechanical trauma. No defects in the aircraft or faults in the parachute or ejection mechanism were found. Reconstruction of the shattered skull base and the cervical vertebrae revealed fusion of the atlanto-occipital joint (occipitalization) and a left paracondylar process. The effective diameter of the spinal canal was decreased by the abnormal articulation. Such malformations can cause a wide range of neurologic deficits. Considering the skill and alertness needed to operate a supersonic fighter aircraft, with the pressure applied by the heavy protective head gear and various G forces endured by the spinal column during flight, we postulate that the collision was related to the pilot's sudden incapacitation.",nocancer
"Microglial upregulation of progranulin as a marker of motor neuron degeneration. Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are overlapping neurodegenerative disorders. Mutations in the growth factor progranulin (PGRN) gene cause FTLD, sometimes in conjunction with ALS; such mutations are also observed in some ALS patients. Most PGRN mutations underlying FTLD are null mutations that result in reduced PGRN levels. We investigated PGRN expression in human ALS and in mouse models of motor neuron degeneration. Progranulin plasma or CSF levels in newly diagnosed ALS patients did not differ from those in healthy or disease controls (PGRN mutation-negative FTLD and Alzheimer disease patients). In the mutant SOD1 mouse model of ALS, spinal cord PGRN levels were normal in presymptomatic animals but increased during the degenerative process. This increase in PGRN correlated with enhanced expression of PGRN in microglia. In CSF, PGRN levels were normal in presymptomatic and early symptomatic animals, but with disease progression, a raise in PGRN was detectable. These data indicate that upregulation of PGRN is a marker of the microglial response that occurs with progression in motor neuron diseases.",nocancer
"Health visitors: finding their place in children's centres. Children's centres aim to improve outcomes for children through the development of integrated services. Health visitors are expected to lead the delivery of child health promotion programmes in geographical areas that include children's centres. During 2007, a group of eight health visitors linked to Phase 2 children's centres in Bristol formed a learning set facilitated by a public health specialist to explore how their role as both caseworkers and public health practitioners could become part of an integrated children's centre team. They developed two linked models intended to help health visitors develop both aspects of their role in practice. First, a proposed management structure for a children's centre which included health visitors at both the strategic and practice delivery levels of the organisation. Second, a conceptualisation of how the proposed management structure would support and develop an integrated team. The paper then discusses an early attempt by one children's centre in Bristol to implement the two models through the development of an integrated outreach team.",nocancer

"Screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) initiatives in California: notable trends, challenges, and recommendations. It is estimated that most substance users are not substance-dependent, yet they misuse alcohol and/or other drugs on a regular basis and are at risk in terms of health and further dependency. Screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) is an intervention model that identifies at-risk substance users and then provides them a patient-centered intervention. A review of selected SBIRT initiatives in California revealed a number of positive trends: the involvement of healthcare settings in substance use prevention; an increase in the number of providers trained in substance use screening; greater use of standardized screening tools; indications of reduced substance use by individuals receiving SBIRT; and the establishment of statewide policy initiatives. Despite these positive trends, SBIRT projects continue to face challenges related to leadership support, staff resources, integration into ongoing protocols, screening, client retention, client confidentiality, and data collection. To assist projects to overcome these challenges and to ensure future adoption and sustainability of SBIRT, state and local authorities can benefit from (a) promoting SBIRT among healthcare leaders, (b) identifying and sharing successful SBIRT ""models"", (c) providing tailored trainings and ongoing technical assistance, (d) educating providers about patient confidentiality and reimbursement laws and regulations, and (e) creating benchmark measures and data collection protocols.",nocancer
"Amitraz poisoning--an unusual pesticide poisoning. AIMS OF THE STUDY: To report the clinical features, laboratory findings and the management instituted for the patients with acute Amitraz Poisoning. METHODS AND MATERIAL: Three cases of acute Amitraz Intoxication were studied and compared with previous reports from the literature. RESULTS: All the three female cases were brought to our hospital with age ranging from 2 years to 40 years, consumed poison by oral route. The ingested amount was ranging from 15 ml to 30 ml. Giddiness and vomiting were the prominent symptoms, next were drowsiness, irritability and respiratory distress. Two cases revealed gastric dilatation. Except hyperglycaemia and glucosuria other laboratory parameters were normal. Unconscious patient's CT brain revealed brain edema. One patient with hypotension improvement with i.v. fluids administration. All the patients recovered completely. DISCUSSION: Formamidines show toxic effects on both humans and animals. Amitraz is slightly toxic. Amitraz shows hepatotoxic, CNS stimulative or depressive effects. It can cause gastric stasis. Amitraz leads to rise in plasma glucose level and suppress insulin release. Decreased body temperature is due to inhibitory effect of Amitraz on Prostaglandin E2 synthesis. Even after poisoning by potentially lethal dose of Amitraz, studies have reported complete recovery. As there is no specific antidote for Amitraz Poisoning the medical management with O2 supplementation, airway maintenance, proper hydration and supportive management are the key factors for complete recovery of the patient. Public Health Education and instructions to drug producing companies will be necessary to decrease the incidence of Amitraz Poisoning.",nocancer

"Is equal moral consideration really compatible with unequal moral status? The issue of moral considerability, or how much moral importance a being's interests deserve, is one of the most important in animal ethics. Some leading theorists--most notably David DeGrazia--have argued that a principle of ""equal moral consideration"" is compatible with ""unequal moral status."" Such a position would reconcile the egalitarian force of equal consideration with more stringent obligations to humans than animals. The article presents arguments that equal consideration is not compatible with unequal moral status, thereby forcing those who would justify significantly different moral protections for humans and animals to argue for unequal consideration.",nocancer
"Epithelial neoplasms of the appendix. CONTEXT: The appendix gives rise to an array of epithelial neoplasms showing glandular or neuroendocrine differentiation, and some tumors with elements of both cell types. Although some appendiceal neoplasms resemble their counterparts in the small and large intestines (conventional adenocarcinoma and carcinoid tumor), the appendix also gives rise to relatively unique entities including mucinous neoplasms and goblet cell carcinoid tumors, which present a challenge in pathologic classification and clinical management. OBJECTIVE: To review clinical and diagnostic issues for 3 pathologic types of epithelial neoplasms of the appendix: (1) adenocarcinoma, with specific focus on mucinous neoplasm; (2) goblet cell carcinoid tumor and associated adenocarcinoma; and (3) typical carcinoid tumor. DATA SOURCES: Case-derived material and literature review.

"Ileus, pregnancy or leiomyoma? A case of a large intraabdominal tumor. OBJECTIVE: Authors evaluate a case of an extremely large leiomyoma, its symptomatology, diagnosis and surgical treatment. They present the possible peroperative complications and emphasize the necessity of the interdisciplinary approach. METHODS: The set of patients consists of 21 patients with leiomyomas of various localizations. All patients were operated by means of conventional operation. The material was sent for classical bioptic examination with the use of immuno-histochemical analysis. RESULTS: Unlike found in literature, the most common appearance of leiomyoma in our set of patients was on small bowel, namely 10 of 21 patients had tumors in this localization. Furthermore there were three tumors of gynecological origin. Two of them had acute abdominal disease (AAD) while in these cases, ileus was a reason for urgent operations. In all three gynecological cases it was difficult to diagnose preoperatively the origin of tumors. In one patient, the preparation led to partial iatrogenic lesion of left ureter which was subsequently treated with primary suture. The authors describe zero mortality. CONCLUSION: Despite the relatively simple diagnosis of leiomyomas, in some cases of extreme size of the tumor combined with its localization in the small pelvis makes it difficult to distinguish it from other mesenchymal tumors. In order eliminate the peroperative complications it is possible to introduce a urethral catheter and to set up a multidisciplinary operation team to achieve combined experience (Fig. 5, Ref. 14).",cancer
"The relationship between methylation of the Syk gene in the promoter region and the genesis of lung cancer. BACKGROUND: To study the expression of the Syk (Spleen Tyrosine Kinase) gene and methylation in its promoter region in lung cancer. To investigate the relationship between silencing of the Syk gene and DNA methylation of the Syk promoter region. METHODS: RT-PCR (Semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR), Real-time PCR (Real-time quantitative PCR) and immunohistochemistry technique, the expression of Syk in specimens from 3 lung cancer cell lines and 16 lung cancer patients (tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues). MSP (Methylation-specific PCR) was used to analyze the methylation status of the Syk promoter region. Then we also investigated the role of restoring Syk expression by using a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-CdR (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine), in suppressing invasion of lung cell lines. RESULTS: No expression of the Syk gene was detected in the 3 lung cancer cell lines. In the 16 lung patient samples, Syk expression was significantly lower in the tumor tissues than in the adjacent normal tissues (P < 0.05). Consistently, immunohistochemistry analyses of Syk protein expression showed that in the cancer tissues Syk protein expression accounted for 5% (1/20), and in the adjacent normal tissues the rate of expression was 100% (20/20). The correlation was highly significant (chi2 = 36.19, P < 0.005). In the only case that showed a positive expression of cancer textus, the level was inferior to the adjacent tissue. In the two lung cancer cell lines (L9981, A549) that lack the endogenous Syk epression, 4uM demethylation agent 5-aza-CdR treatment was able to reactivate the Syk gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: Hypermethylation leads to silencing of the Syk gene in human lung carcinoma. Methylation of the Syk promoter and loss of Syk expression in lung cancer are independent biomarkers, a determination which may offer guidance for selecting appropriate diagnoses and treatments. Syk may be a potential tumor suppressor in human lung cancer.",cancer

"McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS): early and extensive bone fibrous dysplasia involvement and ""mistaken identity"" oophorectomy. BACKGROUND: McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS) is a triad of gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty (GIPP), cafe-au-lait spots (CALS) and fibrous dysplasia (FD) of bone. The extent of the abnormalities is variable. PATIENT AND RESULTS: We report a 3 year old girl with CALS since infancy, FD diagnosed at age of 2.5 years, and at the age of 3 years vaginal bleeding. The ultrasound revealed a cystic mass of the ovary, surgical pathology found ovarian cyst. LHRH stimulation demonstrated GIPP (LH 9.8 mIU/ml and FSH 8.9 mIU/ml; normal LH 1.8-10, FSH 9-26 mIU/ml). Radiographs and bone scans demonstrated FD in multiple bones. Peripheral leucocytes and the ovary were negative for GNAS gene mutations. Treatment with Letrasole interrupted the pubertal development. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the clinical signs of MAS are telling and that timely MAS diagnosis prevents unnecessary oophorectomy. A close follow up is recommended regarding development of endocrine disorders and spreading of FD.",cancer
"A polymorphism (G894T) in eNOS increases the risk of coronary atherosclerosis rather than intracranial atherosclerosis in Koreans. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate whether genetic variations in the eNOS gene were associated with intracranial and extracranial atherosclerosis in Koreans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed data on 282 consecutive Korean patients with atherosclerosis in intracranial (ICAS) or extracranial vessels, and compared with 300 healthy individuals. The eNOS gene polymorphism was analyzed by PCR and direct sequencing. RESULTS: All genetic variants were single nucleotide polymorphism, two in the coding sequence (C774T and G894T) and one in intron 6. The frequency of the G894T polymorphism was significantly higher in the coronary atherosclerosis group than in the control group, but its presence did not correlate with other clinical risk factors. There was no significant difference in genotype and allele frequencies between coronary atherosclerosis and ICAS. CONCLUSION: The G894T polymorphism in the eNOS gene might influence coronary atherosclerosis rather than ICAS in Koreans.",nocancer

"Human evolutionary history: consequences for the pathogenesis of otitis media. The pathogenesis of otitis media is multifactorial, but the role of evolution on its development has not been addressed. We posit that the high prevalence of middle-ear disease is most likely restricted to humans, in contrast to other wild species, because the associated hearing loss would have reduced the fitness of affected individuals as a result of predation. We present here the possible consequences of two human adaptations that may have resulted in ubiquitous otitis media: the interaction of bipedalism and increased brain size, and the loss of facial prognathism resulting from speech or cooking. As a consequence of our adaptation for bipedalism, the female pelvic outlet is constricted, which, in the context of a rapidly enlarging brain, results in humans being born 12 months too soon. Significantly, immature eustachian tube structure and function, in conjunction with an immature immune system, helps to explain the high incidence of otitis media in the first year of life. But the persistence of middle-ear disease beyond this stage is not explained by ""immaturity."" The morphology of the palate changed with the adaptations that produced facial flattening, with concomitant effects on eustachian tube function. These changes resulted in relatively poor human physiologic tubal function in comparison to the nonhuman primate.",nocancer
"Estimation of radiation exposure of prospectively triggered 128-slice computed tomography coronary angiography. PURPOSE: To estimate the effective dose of prospectively triggered computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) in step-and-shoot (SAS) mode, depending on the tube current and tube voltage modulation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For dose measurements, an Alderson-Rando-phantom equipped with thermoluminescent dosimeters was used. The effective dose was calculated according to ICRP 103. Exposure was performed on a 128-slice single source scanner providing a collimation of 128 x 0.6 mm and a rotation time of 0.38 seconds. CTCA in the SAS mode was acquired with variation of the tube current (160, 240, 320 mAs) and tube voltage (100, 120, 140 kV) at a simulated heart rate of 60 beats per minute and a scan range of 13.5 cm. RESULTS: Depending on gender, tube current and tube voltage, the effective dose of a CTCA in SAS mode varies from 2.8 to 10.8 mSv. Due to breast tissue in the primary scan range, exposure in the case of females showed an increase of up to 60.0 +/- .4% compared to males. The dose reduction achieved by a reduction of tube current showed a significant positive, linear correlation to effective dose with a possible decrease in the effective dose of up to 60.4% (r = 0.998; p = 0.044). Disproportionately high, the estimated effective dose can be reduced by using a lower tube voltage with a dose reduction of up to 52.4%. CONCLUSION: Further substantial dose reduction of low-dose CTCA in SAS mode can be achieved by adapting the tube current and tube voltage and should be implemented in the clinical routine, i. e. adapting those protocol parameters to patient body weight.",nocancer
"Human papillomavirus disease and vaccines in adolescents. Review of the most recent evidence indicates that screening for cervical cancer in females younger than 21 years of age likely leads to more harm than good. In addition, screening during adolescence has not lead to decreased cervical cancers in this age group. The rate of cervical cancer remains extremely low in adolescents. In contrast, abnormal cytology is extremely common, of which most is benign. Hence, referral to colposcopy is unnecessary and costly. New guidelines recommend cervical cancer screening to start at the age of 21 years and to not be based on sexual behavior. The exception is for immunocompromised girls, who should be screened once intercourse is initiated, since they are at increased risk for cervical cancer. Recently, we have also broadened our understanding about human papillomavirus-associated disease in men. In this chapter, we cover the advances in science that have led to new screening recommendation for cervical cancer and the advances in prevention: vaccines for both adolescent women and men.",cancer
"Increases in quantitative D-dimer levels correlate with progressive disease better than circulating tumor cell counts in patients with refractory prostate cancer. Changes in quantitative D-dimer levels, circulating tumor cell (CTC) counts, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were measured in 28 patients with refractory castration-resistant prostate cancer to assess their concordance during the course of therapy and their relationship with risk of progressive disease. A significant correlation was identified between changes in PSA and both CTC counts and D-dimer levels (r = 0.67 and 0.58, respectively; P < .001). In addition, there was a significant correlation between changes in CTC count and D-dimer level (r = 0.62; P < .001). A significantly stronger concordance between these biomarkers was noted for increasing values (sensitivity, 72%-77.8%) compared with decreasing values (specificity, 43.8%-71.4%). Notably, increases in PSA and D-dimer levels, not CTC counts, were associated with increased risks for progressive disease (P < .024).

"Self- and registry-reported cancer in a population-based longitudinal study. PURPOSE: To evaluate the concordance of cancer diagnosis from self- and registry reports. METHODS: Self-reported diagnosis information from participants in a cohort study was compared with linkage data from the Wisconsin Cancer Reporting System. RESULTS: Overall, there was good agreement between self- and registry-reported cancers, with 90% of all matches being considered an exact match. Concordance varied by cancer site; agreement was excellent for breast (85.4%) and prostate (78.9%) cancers. CONCLUSIONS: While self-reported cancer diagnoses for some cancers such as breast and prostate cancer are important sources of information and may be reliable substitutes when registry data are incomplete or not available, a combination of self and registry reports with mortality information may yield the most accurate information about cancer for purposes of health care planning and conducting epidemiologic studies.",cancer
"Biology and clinical applications of CD40 in cancer treatment. CD40 is a costimulatory molecule widely expressed by immune cells and by neoplastic cells of different histotypes. Engagement of surface CD40 mediates different effects depending on cell type and microenvironment. In particular, CD40 expression on immune cells regulates humoral and cellular immunity, while it has apoptotic and antiproliferative activity on selected neoplastic cells. Thus, CD40 targeting may indirectly affect tumor growth through the activation of immune cells and/or directly by mediating cytotoxic effects on neoplastic cells. Preliminary findings emerging from clinical trials indicate that antibodies to CD40 can induce immune modulation and clinical responses in cancer patients.",cancer
"Synthetic calcium phosphate ceramics for treatment of bone fractures. Bone is a complex natural material with outstanding mechanical properties and remarkable self-healing capabilities. The mechanical strength is achieved by a complex structure of a mineral part comprising apatitic calcium phosphate crystals embedded in an organic matrix. Bone also contains several types of cells constantly replacing mature bone with new bone. These cells are able to seal fractures and fill gaps with new bone in case of structural damage. However, if a defect exceeds a critical size, surgery is necessary to fill the void with a spacer in order to prevent soft tissue from growing into the defect and delaying the healing process. The spacers, also known as bone grafts, can either be made of fresh bone from the patient, of processed bone from donor organisms, or of synthetic materials chemically similar to the mineral part of bone. Synthetic bone void fillers are also known as bone graft substitutes. This review aims at explaining the biological and chemical background that lead to the development of synthetic bone graft substitutes and gives an overview of the current state of development. It also highlights the multidisciplinary nature of biomaterials research, which combines cell biology and medicine with chemistry, mineralogy, crystallography, and mechanical engineering.",nocancer
"Optimization and validation of an LC-fLD method for biotin in infant formula, infant cereals, cocoa-malt beverages, and clinical nutrition products. A fast and simple chromatographic method to determine biotin in foods is presented. Biotin is extracted using papain (60 degrees C, 1 h). After pH adjustment and filtration, biotin is determined by LC with fluorescence detection using postcolumn reagent avidin-FITC (avidin labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate). The method has been validated in a large range of products: milk- and soy-based infant formulas, cereals, cocoa-malt beverages, and clinical nutrition products. The method showed recovery rates of 98.1 +/- 5.7% (average +/- SD) in a large range of concentrations. Biotin concentrations determined in infant formula standard reference materials 1846 and 1849 were in agreement with reference values. RSD of repeatability (RSDr) varied from 2.0 to 4.5%, and intermediate reproducibility (RSD(iR)) from 5.8 to 9.4%. LOD and LOQ were 3.0 and 5.0 microg/100 g, respectively.

It can be used as a faster, more selective, and precise alternative to the classical microbiological determination, and is easily transferable among laboratories.",nocancer
"Androgen receptor-mTOR crosstalk is regulated by testosterone availability: implication for prostate cancer cell survival. BACKGROUND: Signaling between androgen receptor (AR) and mTOR may be crucial for prostate cancer cells to endure the low androgen and suboptimal nutrient conditions produced by androgen deprivation therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: AR and mTOR cross-talk was examined in LNCaP cells exposed to either high or low testosterone. AR and mTOR activities were modified separately using either siRNA knockdown or specific chemical inhibitor. The biological significance of the reciprocal communication was assessed by susceptibility to glucose deprivation-induced cell death. RESULTS: AR positively regulated mTOR activity in both low and high testosterone levels. TSC1 and TSC2, the two negative regulators of mTOR, may be involved since both were up-regulated by AR knockdown. Sub-baseline mTOR increased AR protein levels. However, this effect only occurred with low testosterone. More cells underwent apoptosis if AR function was inhibited during glucose deprivation, which significantly depressed mTOR activity. CONCLUSION: The compensatory increase of AR function due to a repressed mTOR signal is advantageous for survival. Disrupting this loop at the time of initiation of androgen deprivation therapy may delay, or even prevent, the recurrence of prostate cancer.",cancer
"Ectosomes as modulators of inflammation and immunity. Vesicles released by cells have been described using various names, including exosomes, microparticles, microvesicles and ectosomes. Here we propose to differentiate clearly between ectosomes and exosomes according to their formation and release. Whereas exosomes are formed in multi-vesicular bodies, ectosomes are vesicles budding directly from the cell surface. Depending upon the proteins expressed, exosomes activate or inhibit the immune system. One of the major properties of exosomes released by antigen-presenting cells is to induce antigen-specific T cell activation. Thus, they have been used for tumour immunotherapy. By contrast, the major characteristics of ectosomes released by various cells, including tumour cells, polymorphonuclear leucocytes and erythrocytes, are the expression of phosphatidylserine and to have anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive activities similarly to apoptotic cells.",cancer
"Hdac3 is essential for the maintenance of chromatin structure and genome stability. Hdac3 is essential for efficient DNA replication and DNA damage control. Deletion of Hdac3 impaired DNA repair and greatly reduced chromatin compaction and heterochromatin content. These defects corresponded to increases in histone H3K9,K14ac; H4K5ac; and H4K12ac in late S phase of the cell cycle, and histone deposition marks were retained in quiescent Hdac3-null cells. Liver-specific deletion of Hdac3 culminated in hepatocellular carcinoma. Whereas HDAC3 expression was downregulated in only a small number of human liver cancers, the mRNA levels of the HDAC3 cofactor NCOR1 were reduced in one-third of these cases. siRNA targeting of NCOR1 and SMRT (NCOR2) increased H4K5ac and caused DNA damage, indicating that the HDAC3/NCOR/SMRT axis is critical for maintaining chromatin structure and genomic stability.",cancer
"Life stress due to losses and deficit in childhood and adolescence as breast cancer risk factor: a prospective case-control study in Kuopio, Finland. BACKGROUND: To our knowledge, the associations between the life stress due to losses and deficit at childhood and adolescence and the risk of breast cancer are rarely considered together in a prospective study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is an extension of the Kuopio Breast Cancer Study. Women with breast symptoms were referred by physicians to the Kuopio University Hospital (Finland) and were asked to participate in this study. These women (n=115) were interviewed, and all study variables were obtained before any diagnostic procedures were carried out, so neither the investigator nor the participants knew the final diagnosis of breast symptoms at the time of the interview. The research method used was the semistructured in-depth interview method. The investigator used the Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale (MADRS) to evaluate the depression of the study participants. All participants were also asked to complete standardized questionnaires (Beck depression inventory and Spielberger trait inventory). RESULTS: The clinical examination and biopsy showed breast cancer in 34 patients, benign breast disease in 53 patients, and 28 individuals were shown to be healthy. The BC group had significantly higher mean score for the deficit in childhood than the BBD and HSS groups (p<0.05). The women in the BC group had almost significantly higher mean scores for the loss of social status in childhood than the women in the BBD and HSS groups (p=0.05). The BC group had also significantly more severe deficit in childhood than the BBD and HSS groups (p=0.02). The results indicated that breast cancer patients tended to have more life stress due to losses and deficit in childhood and adolescence than BBD and HSS groups. CONCLUSION: The results of this study support a weak association between life stress due to losses and deficit in childhood and adolescence and breast cancer risk. However, the biological explanation for such an association is unclear and it might be that stress due to losses and deficit impacts indirectly on breast cancer risk, affecting behaviour, or directly on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and autonomic nervous system functioning.",cancer
"Up-regulation of fibronectin and tissue transglutaminase promotes cell invasion involving increased association with integrin and MMP expression in A431 cells. In human tumors, fibronectin (FN) expression is positively associated with tumor metastatic potential and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) secretion. Additionally, tissue transglutaminase (TG2) is implicated as playing an important role in tumor progression, and acts as a co-receptor for integrin-mediated cell binding to FN. This study explored the involvement of FN and TG2 in cancer cell metastasis using the recently established highly invasive A431-III subline. A431-III cells expressed significantly higher levels of FN and TG2 as compared to the parental line (A431-P). Knockdown of endogenous FN by small interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in dramatic suppression of the migratory and invasive activity, and the secreted MMP-9 activity (but not MMP-2) in A431-III subline. Exogenous administration of FN to A431-III cells also increased the secreted activity of MMP-9 but not MMP-2. Interestingly, knockdown of TG2 by siRNA dramatically reduced the cell attachment, migration and invasion, and the secretion of MMP-9 and MMP-1 (but not MMP-2 and MMP-3) in A431-III cells as compared to A431-P cells. Furthermore, A431-III cells exhibited increased association of integrin beta1 and beta3 with FN and TG2, and knockdown of TG2 markedly suppressed integrin beta1 interaction with FN. Together, this study suggests that FN and TG2 facilitate the metastatic activity of A431 tumor cells, and this may be partly attributed to TG2 enhancement of the association of FN and beta integrin. In addition, the combined targeting of TG2 and FN may be an effective therapeutic strategy for cancer displaying increased expression of both proteins.",cancer
"Dental professionals' knowledge and perceived need for education in bioterrorism preparedness. Dental professionals should be well prepared to provide care during bioterrorist events. In this study, we assessed the knowledge, opinions about playing various roles during a bioterrorist event, and perceived need for education of dental professionals (dentists and dental hygienists) from one region (Oregon) that had been exposed to bioterrorism and from another region (New England) not exposed. This cross-sectional study used an eighteen-item pretested, self-administered questionnaire distributed at the 2005 Oregon Dental Conference (n=156) and 2005 Yankee Dental Conference (n=297). Dental professionals' knowledge and perceived need for education on bioterrorist preparedness were quantified by multivariate linear and logistic modeling. More than 90 percent of the dental professionals were willing to provide care during bioterrorist events. Perceived knowledge was high; however, actual knowledge was low. Dental professionals who wanted to attend a continuing education course and who thought dental professionals should play more roles during a bioterrorist attack had higher actual knowledge. Willingness to provide care was not supported by adequate knowledge. No significant differences between New England and Oregon dental professionals were observed in terms of actual knowledge or perceived need for bioterrorism education. Integrating training and education into the predoctoral dental and dental hygiene curricula and developing continuing education courses would improve knowledge and better prepare dental professionals to effectively perform American Dental Association-recommended roles during any future bioterrorism events.",nocancer
"Can features evaluated in the routine pathologic assessment of lymph node-negative estrogen receptor-positive stage I or II invasive breast cancer be used to predict the Oncotype DX recurrence score? CONTEXT: Oncotype DX is a multigene reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay used to quantify recurrence risk in patients with stage I or II estrogen receptor-positive, lymph node-negative invasive breast cancer. The results are reported as a Recurrence Score (RS). The 16 cancer genes evaluated include a proliferation set, hormone receptor set, and HER2 set. The activity of these genes is addressed by pathologic assessment of breast cancers. OBJECTIVE: To determine if factors evaluated in pathologic evaluation of breast cancer could be used to predict Oncotype DX results. DESIGN: We studied 138 cases of invasive breast cancer for which Oncotype DX results and pathology data were available. Grading was performed by using Nottingham grading system. For hormone receptor immunostaining, 10% nuclear staining was considered a positive result. RESULTS: Oncotype DX RS was low in 81 cases, intermediate in 44 cases, and high in 13 cases. All 6 cases with both a negative progesterone receptor (PR) and a mitotic count score of 3 had a high RS. All 12 cases with both a negative PR and a mitotic count score greater than 1 had either an intermediate or high RS. Although Nottingham grade, PR status, mitotic count score, tumor size, and nuclear grade were each significantly associated with RS, in bivariate analyses the only variables that remained independently predictive of an intermediate or high RS score in a multivariate logistic regression model were negative PR and mitotic count score greater than 1. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that a mitotic count score greater than 1 combined with a negative PR result, as determined by pathologic assessment, could serve as a marker for an intermediate or high Oncotype DX RS.",cancer

"Atlanto-occipital ligament calcification: a novel sign in nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. BACKGROUND: The nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS), first described by Gorlin and Goltz in 1960, is a hereditary autosomal dominant disease with high penetrance and variable expressivity. Almost 70% of patients with NBCCS have some degree of craniofacial anomaly. Among these, the presence of ectopic calcification have been reported but Atlanto-occipital ligament calcification has never been described. Therefore this investigation was carried out to determine the prevalence of atlanto-occipital ligament calcification on lateral x-ray of NBCCS patients aiming to assess the effectiveness of this sign in NBCCS diagnosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Lateral and frontal cephalometric radiographs of 18 patients (11 males and 7 females), aged 8-61 years, with the diagnosis of NBCCS were evaluated for the presence of intracranial calcifications (diaphragma sellae and falx cerebri) and or calcification of the atlanto-occipital ligament. RESULTS: A total of 11 patients presented calcification of atlanto-occipital ligament to various degrees and in three cases this represented the only sign of ectopic calcification. When compared to the other two sites of ossification, atlanto-occipital ligament calcification had a similar prevalence. CONCLUSION: The calcification of the atlanto-occipital ligament should be considered in addition to the other major criteria for NBCCS diagnosis.",cancer
"Masseteric venous malformations: diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To describe a typical presentation of venous malformation within the masseter muscle, including physical findings and imaging, and to present the University of California, San Francisco's (UCSF) Vascular Anomalies and Birthmark Center's (VABC) experience with sclerotherapy for these lesions. STUDY DESIGN: Case series with chart review. SETTING: Tertiary care medical center. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Retrospective chart review of all patients presenting to the UCSF VABC over a 10-year period. RESULTS: Twelve patients with isolated venous malformations of the masseter muscle were identified. All of these patients presented with pain and facial asymmetry that was more pronounced with jaw-clenching. All underwent magnetic resonance imaging demonstrating a T2 hyperintense homogenous mass contained within the masseter muscle. Eleven of 12 had evidence on imaging of phleboliths within the mass; 10 patients underwent sclerotherapy. All treated patients had initial improvement in symptoms and/or appearance. Seven of 10 have had sustained improvement at a mean follow-up of 28 months. CONCLUSION: Masseteric venous malformations have a typical clinical presentation and imaging characteristics that should allow clinicians to distinguish them from other abnormalities presenting in this area. Percutaneous sclerotherapy should be considered as a treatment option for these patients and can result in excellent outcomes.",nocancer
"Patient preferences for obsessive-compulsive disorder treatment. OBJECTIVE: To explore preferences for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). We hypothesized that OCD patients will select a combination of medication and psychotherapy as their most preferred choice overall. METHOD: The authors designed a treatment-preference survey using 2 health economics methods, forced-choice and contingent-ranking methods, to elicit preferences for OCD treatment available in mainstream care (serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SRIs], exposure and response prevention [EX/RP], and their combination) and for novel treatments under development at OCD research clinics. This survey was given by telephone to 89 individuals with OCD who called the OCD research clinic at the New York State Psychiatric Institute between July 2008 and January 2009. Diagnosis of OCD was based on a telephone screening evaluation adapted from the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders. RESULTS: Most participants chose combination treatment (43%) or EX/RP (42%) over SRI medication (16%). Participants ranked investigational psychotherapy as their most-preferred novel treatment (endorsed by 48% of participants) and deep brain stimulation as their least-preferred novel treatment (endorsed by 77% of participants). Qualitative data suggest that prior treatment experience, concerns about medications, and logistical and practical concerns about treatment regimens affect preferences. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with OCD have identifiable treatment preferences. In this sample of convenience, most preferred either combination treatment or psychotherapy. Future studies should investigate prospectively what modifies these preferences and how these preferences affect treatment outcome.",nocancer
"Advanced treatment planning methods for efficient radiation therapy with laser accelerated proton and ion beams. PURPOSE: Laser plasma acceleration can potentially replace large and expensive cyclotrons or synchrotrons for radiotherapy with protons and ions. On the way toward a clinical implementation, various challenges such as the maximum obtainable energy still remain to be solved. In any case, laser accelerated particles exhibit differences compared to particles from conventional accelerators. They typically have a wide energy spread and the beam is extremely pulsed (i.e., quantized) due to the pulsed nature of the employed lasers. The energy spread leads to depth dose curves that do not show a pristine Bragg peak but a wide high dose area, making precise radiotherapy impossible without an additional energy selection system. Problems with the beam quantization include the limited repetition rate and the number of accelerated particles per laser shot. This number might be too low, which requires a high repetition rate, or it might be too high, which requires an additional fluence selection system to reduce the number of particles. Trying to use laser accelerated particles in a conventional way such as spot scanning leads to long treatment times and a high amount of secondary radiation produced when blocking unwanted particles. METHODS: The authors present methods of beam delivery and treatment planning that are specifically adapted to laser accelerated particles. In general, it is not necessary to fully utilize the energy selection system to create monoenergetic beams for the whole treatment plan. Instead, within wide parts of the target volume, beams with broader energy spectra can be used to simultaneously cover multiple axially adjacent spots of a conventional dose delivery grid as applied in intensity modulated particle therapy. If one laser shot produces too many particles, they can be distributed over a wider area with the help of a scattering foil and a multileaf collimator to cover multiple lateral spot positions at the same time. These methods are called axial and lateral clustering and reduce the number of particles that have to be blocked in the beam delivery system. Furthermore, the optimization routine can be adjusted to reduce the number of dose spots and laser shots. The authors implemented these methods into a research treatment planning system for laser accelerated particles. RESULTS: The authors' proposed methods can decrease the amount of secondary radiation produced when blocking particles with wrong energies or when reducing the total number of particles from one laser shot. Additionally, caused by the efficient use of the beam, the treatment time is reduced considerably. Both improvements can be achieved without extensively changing the quality of the treatment plan since conventional intensity modulated particle therapy usually includes a certain amount of unused degrees of freedom which can be used to adapt to laser specific properties. CONCLUSIONS: The advanced beam delivery and treatment planning methods reduce the need to have a perfect laser-based accelerator reproducing the properties of conventional accelerators that might not be possible without increasing treatment time and secondary radiation to the patient. The authors show how some of the differences to conventional beams can be overcome and efficiently used for radiation treatment.",cancer
"Potential misdiagnosis of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma with Hodgkin's lymphoma: a case report. BACKGROUND: Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) is an aggressive neoplasm. We investigated the potential utility of touch imprints evaluated in conjunction with the histology of lymph nodes in the diagnosis of AITL. CASE A 58-year-old man presented with generalized lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and autoimmune phenomena, which complicated the diagnosis. Touch imprints were obtained from the lymph node biopsy, which were valuable in making the correct diagnosis. The cytologic and microscopic features of these imprints and lymph node samples showed a heterogeneous population of hematolymphoid cells, including small to intermediate lymphoid cells, immunoblasts, plasma cells, dendritic cells, and eosinophils, as well as small vessels that were surrounded by some of the abnormal cells. Neoplastic cells stained positive for CD3, CD4, and CD5. Isolated immunoblasts stained with CD20 and CD30. CONCLUSION: We draw attention to this neoplastic diagnosis and correlate the cytomorphologic and immunohistochemical findings with the adequate clinical setting in order to avoid misdiagnosis, primarily with Hodgkin's lymphoma and reactive hyperplasia. Touch imprints are useful in the diagnosis of AITL if the broad population of proliferating cells is distinguished. However, some cases display binucleated or mononucleated cells with prominent nucleoli and many eosinophils, which may induce a potential misdiagnosis with Hodgkin's lymphoma.",cancer
"Narrative review: BRAF opens the door for therapeutic advances in melanoma. Patients with metastatic melanoma have a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. In about one half of analyzed patients with metastatic melanoma, a mutated signal transduction molecule has been identified: v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF). This molecule is part of an intracellular signaling cascade and may play a role in many different types of cancer. This article provides an overview of the current treatment options for metastatic melanoma and describes the pathophysiology underlying the development of therapies based on inhibition of BRAF. It summarizes findings of phase 1 and phase 2 studies of BRAF inhibitor therapy primarily in patients with metastatic melanoma, who have shown objective response rates of 70% to 80%. However, initial responses have not been sustained, with a median time to relapse of approximately 9 months. Clinicians should be aware of phase 3 trials of these agents and trials combining these therapies with other novel therapies because, at a minimum, BRAF inhibitors seem to be valuable as palliative therapy for metastatic melanoma.",cancer
"Ki-67 proliferation rate as a prognostic marker in major salivary gland carcinomas. OBJECTIVES: The study was performed to evaluate the prognostic relevance of cell proliferation associated with Ki-67/ Mib-1 immunostaining in malignant tumors of the major salivary glands. METHODS: Cell proliferation was evaluated by Mib-1 antibody against Ki-67 antigen in 41 patients with cancer of the parotid or submandibular glands, including 14 acinic cell carcinomas, 12 ductal carcinomas, 7 mucoepidermoid carcinomas, 5 carcinomas ex pleomorphic adenoma, 1 adenoid cystic carcinoma, 1 undifferentiated carcinoma, and 1 polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: Patients with Ki-67 values of more than 15% and those with Ki-67 values of 15% or less differed both in disease-free survival (p < 0.001) and in overall survival (p < 0.001). We evaluated the association between Ki-67 and time to recurrence in correlation to age, sex, ductal histotype, and N stage; the Cox regression model was significant (p = 0.013). In the group of patients with T1 and T2 cancers, those with Ki-67 values of 15% or less had better survival rates than did those with Ki-67 values of more than 15% (p = 0.004). In the group of patients with N0 cancers, those with Ki-67 values of 15% or less had a better survival than did those with Ki-67 values of more than 15% (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to stratify different risk classes in early T1-T2 or N0 malignant tumors of the major salivary glands that identified aggressive lesions with elevated Ki-67 expression at an initial stage.",cancer

Following surgery, all elbows were clinically stable and there was 100% survivorship of the prosthesis. Evaluation of function was assessed clinically and by the Mayo Elbow Performance Score, achieving a mean of 86% (70 to 100). Results at medium-term follow-up are encouraging with regards to elbow stability, implant survivorship and functional outcome.",cancer
"Role of imaging in the preoperative staging of small bowel neuroendocrine tumors. BACKGROUND: Imaging studies are important in the preoperative staging of patients with small bowel neuroendocrine tumors (NET) and when selecting patients for cytoreduction procedures for metastatic disease. The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of preoperative imaging compared with operative findings in the staging of small bowel NET. STUDY DESIGN: Sixty-four patients with small bowel NET undergoing laparotomy and who had preoperative imaging with combinations of CT, MR, and radionuclide scintigraphy were reviewed. Results of imaging studies were compared with operative findings to assess the ability of these investigations to detect mesenteric, peritoneal, and hepatic metastases. RESULTS: Mesenteric nodal metastases were seen on imaging in 47 (73%) patients and were present at laparotomy in 56 (88%) patients. Peritoneal metastases were seen on preoperative imaging in 4 (6%) patients and found at laparotomy in 16 (25%) patients. Hepatic metastases were seen on imaging in 42 patients (66%) and found at laparotomy in 49 (77%). Sensitivity and specificity for detection of hepatic metastases were 77% and 100% for CT, 82% and 100% for MR, 63% and 100% for (123)I-meta-iodobenzylguanadine scintigraphy, and 63% and 100% for (111)In-octreotide. Imaging studies failed to detect hepatic metastases in 7 patients and underestimated the extent of hepatic metastatic disease in 17 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Imaging of small bowel NET, even with combinations of CT, MR, and radionuclide studies, underestimates the extent of peritoneal, mesenteric, and hepatic metastatic disease. Accurate staging of small bowel NET might be best performed at the time of laparotomy.",cancer
"mTORC1 signaling under hypoxic conditions is controlled by ATM-dependent phosphorylation of HIF-1alpha. The mTOR complex-1 (mTORC1) coordinates cell growth and metabolism, acting as a restriction point under stress conditions such as low oxygen tension (hypoxia). Hypoxia suppresses mTORC1 signaling. However, the signals by which hypoxia suppresses mTORC1 are only partially understood, and a direct link between hypoxia-driven physiological stress and the regulation of mTORC1 signaling is unknown. Here we show that hypoxia results in ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)-dependent phosphorylation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1alpha) on serine(696) and mediates downregulation of mTORC1 signaling. Deregulation of these pathways in pediatric solid tumor xenografts suggests a link between mTORC1 dysregulation and solid tumor development and points to an important role for hypoxic regulation of mTORC1 activity in tumor development.",nocancer

"Cytohistomorphologic features of malignant fibrous histiocytoma of the breast: a case report. BACKGROUND: Malignant mesenchymal tumors constitute < 1% of all malignant neoplasms of the breast. These include pure primary sarcoma of the breast, metastatic sarcoma and sarcomatous patterns in metaplastic carcinomas. On fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), the cellular features can suggest the diagnosis of sarcoma of the breast, although the potential exists for confusion with very poorly differentiated carcinoma. CASE: A case of recurrent primary malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) occurred in the breast in a 32-year-old woman. The patient presented with a fungating mass in the right breast. FNAC was suggestive of malignant mesenchymal tumor, most probably MFH. The diagnosis was confirmed on biopsy. CONCLUSION: Malignant fibrous histiocytoma of the breast is a rare entity, and a complete clinicopathologic correlation with immunohistochemical profile is essential to arrive at a correct diagnosis and guide appropriate management of the patient.",cancer

"Ovarian small cell carcinoma, hypercalcemic type exhibiting a response to high-dose chemotherapy. A gravida 2, para 2 25-year-old woman three months post-partum presented to her primary physician with abdominal pain and bloating; a 20-cm complex cystic pelvic mass was identified by ultrasound. No ovarian masses were noted during ultrasound exam at the prior pregnancy, less than one year earlier. Her labs included hypercalcemia (11.8 mg/dL, normal less than 10.5) and an elevated CA 125 (160 U/mL, normal less than 35). An exploratory laparotomy revealed a 20-cm right ovarian mass. Frozen section was performed and a sex cord-stromal tumor was favored. Permanent sections of the specimen, however, revealed round, closely packed neoplastic cells with a high nuclear to cytoplasm ratio and high mitotic rate growing in a diffuse pattern with scattered follicle-like, ill-defined microcystic spaces. Immunohistochemical stains revealed the neoplasm to be focally positive for keratin and negative for inhibin. The final diagnosis rendered was small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type. Further staging revealed para-aortic lymph node involvement (stage IIIC). Current literature suggests a very poor prognosis for these neoplasms despite aggressive therapy, with an overall survival rate of 10 percent. Rare response has been noted, however, with high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant. Our patient underwent a rigorous chemotherapeutic regimen followed by peripheral blood stem cell transplant, and as of August 2010, (17 months after initial diagnosis), the patient has had no recurrence.",cancer
"Risk assessment for recurrent venous thrombosis. Venous thrombosis is a common disease that frequently recurs. Recurrence can be prevented by anticoagulants, albeit at the cost of bleeding. Thus, assessment of the risk of recurrence is important to balance the risks and benefits of anticoagulation treatment. Many clinical and laboratory risk factors for recurrent venous thrombosis have been established. Nevertheless, prediction of recurrence in an individual patient remains a challenge. Detection of some laboratory markers is associated with only a moderate risk of recurrence, and the relevance of others is not known. Many patients have several risk factors and the effect of combined defects is obscure. Routine screening for these laboratory markers should therefore be abandoned. Risk assessment can be improved by measurement of global markers that encompass the effects of clotting and fibrinolytic disorders. Analysis of preliminary data suggests that risk assessment can also be refined through integration of prothrombotic coagulation changes and clinical risk factors.",nocancer
"Prevention of tumour cell dissemination in diagnostic needle procedures. BACKGROUND: A side effect of diagnostic needle biopsies is the possibility to disseminate tumour cells into the needle track, which may cause concern in certain malignant tumour types. METHODS: In order to prevent tumour cell dissemination we developed a technology that uses radiofrequency (RF) pulses to sterilise the needle track and denaturate tumour cells. To determine feasibility, we applied this technology to fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) and used breast cancer as a model tumour. Routine FNAB was performed in 88 patients with adenocarcinoma and blood droplets passing the skin orifice were cytomorphologically analysed for the presence of tumour cells. RESULTS: The analysis showed the presence of tumour cells in 65/88 cases (74%). When using an experimental anti-seeding device in a subset of patients viable tumour cells were found in 0/31 cases (P<0.001). In all 31 patients blood passing the skin orifice was sparse. No degrading effect on the cytological sample inside the needle was detected and pain caused by the RF pulses was comparable to that of the biopsy procedure itself. CONCLUSION: The herein presented method has the potential to prevent the dissemination of viable tumour cells in the needle track and minimize bleeding without additional pain or degradation of the aspirate.",cancer
"Spanish validation of the University of Washington Quality of Life questionnaire for head and neck cancer patients. OBJECTIVE: The University of Washington Quality of Life (UW-QOL) questionnaire is one of the most widely used instruments to evaluate the quality of life of head and neck cancer patients. The aim of this study was to perform a Spanish translation and validation of the UW-QOL questionnaire. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SETTING: Three tertiary-care hospitals and a laryngectomee rehabilitation center. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The translation and cultural adaptation of the questionnaire were performed following accepted international guidelines. The psychometric validation was performed on a consecutive series of patients treated for squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract with no signs of relapse, recruited from May 2007 to December 2008. Eligible subjects were invited to complete the Spanish version of the UW-QOL questionnaire during routine clinical consultation, and complete it again within 15 days. Subjects also completed a validated Spanish version of the Goldberg Mental Health Survey and were evaluated by the use of the Karnofsky Index. RESULTS: A Spanish version of the questionnaire was developed in iterative fashion. In the psychometric validation process, a total of 76 patients were analyzed. Reliability was excellent, including both internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha of 0.84) and test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient between 0.91 and 0.97 with a confidence interval of 95%). Construct validity was supported by statistically significant relationships between the Karnofsky Index, the Goldberg Mental Health Survey, and the translated UW-QOL questionnaire.

"In vitro cytotoxicity of transparent yellow iron oxide nanoparticles on human glioma cells. With rapid development of nanotechnology, concerns about the possible adverse health effects on human beings by using nanomaterials have been raised. Transparent yellow iron oxide (alpha-FeOOH) nanoparticles have been widely used in paints, plastic, rubber, building materials, papermaking, food products and pharmaceutical industry, thus the potential health implications by the exposure should be considered. The purpose of this study is to assess the cytotoxicity of transparent yellow iron oxide nanoparticles on U251 human glioma cells. The alpha-FeOOH nanoparticles are in clubbed shapes with 9 nm in diameter and 43 nm long. The specific surface area is 115.3 m2/g. After physicochemical characterization of the nanoparticles, U251 cells were exposed to a-FeOOH at the doses of 0, 3.75, 15, 60 and 120 microg/mL. The results showed that the alpha-FeOOH nanoparticles reduced the cell viability and induced necrosis and apoptosis in U251 cells. In addition, nanoparticle exposure significantly increased the levels of superoxide anion and nitric oxide in a dose-dependent fashion in the cells. Our results suggest that exposure to alpha-FeOOH nanoparticles induce significant free radical formation and cytotoxic effects. The large surface area that induced high surface reactivity may play an important role in the cytotoxic effect of alpha-FeOOH nanoparticles.",cancer
"MDM2 as a modifier gene in retinoblastoma. Variability in the age of onset and number of tumors is occasionally described among retinoblastoma patients, and possible genetic modifiers might lie in the pRB or p53 pathways, both of which are involved in the development of retinoblastoma. MDM2, which increases p53 and pRB catabolism, is therefore a prominent candidate. The minor allele of MDM2 that includes a 309T>G transversion (single-nucleotide polymorphism rs2279744) in the MDM2 promoter is known to enhance MDM2 expression. Its genetic transmission was studied in 326 individuals including 212 RB1 mutation carriers in 70 retinoblastoma families, and the marker genotype was tested for association with age at diagnosis and disease phenotype. In family-based association analyses, the MDM2 309G allele was found to be statistically significantly associated with incidence of bilateral or unilateral retinoblastoma among members of retinoblastoma families (Z = 3.305, two-sided exact P = .001) under a recessive model (ie, affected patients tend to be homozygous for the G allele); in transmission disequilibrium analyses using the recessive model, the association was also observed (estimated odds ratio = 4.0, 95% confidence interval = 1.3 to 12.0). The strong association of this genotype with retinoblastoma development designates MDM2 as the first modifier gene to be identified among retinoblastoma patients and suggests that enhancement of pRB haploinsufficiency and/or resistance to p53-mediated apoptosis is critical to tumor formation.",cancer
"CRIM1 is expressed at higher levels in drug-resistant than in drug-sensitive myeloid leukemia HL60 cells. AIM: The aim of this study was to explore possible differences in the mRNA expression levels of CRIM1, SMAD5, BMP4 and BMP7 in sensitive (S) and multidrug-resistant (R0.5) myeloid leukemia HL60 cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HL60S and HL60R0.5 cells were exposed to daunorubicin (DNR) or cytarabine (Ara-C). RESULTS: Baseline levels of CRIM1 were found to be 15-fold higher in HL60R0.5 than in HL60S. Sixteen hours of exposure to DNR resulted in a 5.6-fold increase in CRIM1 levels in HL60S. Exposure to either DNR or Ara-C resulted in modest increases in CRIM1 levels in HL60R0.5. Similarly, baseline levels of SMAD5 and BMP4 were higher in HL60R0.5 than in HL60S cells. Analysis of the drug SMAD5-resistance marker permeability-glycoprotein (Pgp) revealed that CRIM1 and Pgp exhibit a covariance pattern of expression. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that CRIM1 is expressed at high levels in resistant leukemia cells, indicating that CRIM1 may play a role in drug-resistance.",cancer
"Characterization of a real-time surface image-guided stereotactic positioning system. PURPOSE: The AlignRT3C system is an image-guided stereotactic positioning system (IGSPS) that provides real-time target localization. This study involves the first use of this system with three camera pods. The authors have evaluated its localization accuracy and tracking ability using a cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) system and an optical tracking system in a clinical setting. METHODS: A modified Rando head-and-neck phantom and five patients receiving intracranial stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) were used to evaluate the calibration, registration, and position-tracking accuracies of the AlignRT3C system and to study surface reconstruction uncertainties, including the effects due to interfractional and intrafractional motion, skin tone, room light level, camera temperature, and image registration region of interest selection. System accuracy was validated through comparison with the Elekta kV CBCT system (XVI) and the Varian frameless SonArray (FSA) optical tracking system. Surface-image data sets were acquired with the AlignRT3C daily for the evaluation of pretreatment and interfractional and intrafractional motion for each patient. Results for two different reference image sets, planning CT surface contours (CTS) and previously recorded AlignRT3C optical surface images (ARTS), are reported. RESULTS: The system origin displacements for the AlignRT3C and XVI systems agreed to within 1.3 mm and 0.7 degrees. Similar results were seen for AlignRT3C vs FSA. For the phantom displacements having couch angles of 0 degrees, those that utilized ART_S references resulted in a mean difference of 0.9 mm/0.4 degrees with respect to XVI and 0.3 mm/0.2 degrees with respect to FSA. For phantom displacements of more than +/- 10 mm and +/- 3 degrees, the maximum discrepancies between AlignRT and the XVI and FSA systems were 3.0 and 0.4 mm, respectively. For couch angles up to +/- 90 degrees, the mean (max.) difference between the AlignRT3C and FSA was 1.2 (2.3) mm/0.7 degrees (1.2 degrees). For all tests, the mean registration errors obtained using the CT_S references were approximately 1.3 mm/1.0 degrees larger than those obtained using the ART_S references. For the patient study, the mean differences in the pretreatment displacements were 0.3 mm/0.2 degrees between the AlignRT3C and XVI systems and 1.3 mm/1 degrees between the FSA and XVI systems. For noncoplanar treatments, interfractional motion displacements obtained using the ART_S and CT_S references resulted in 90th percentile differences within 2.1 mm/0.8 degrees and 3.3 mm/0.3 degrees, respectively, compared to the FSA system. Intrafractional displacements that were tracked for a maximum of 14 min were within 1 mm/1 degrees of those obtained with the FSA system. Uncertainties introduced by the bite-tray were as high as 3 mm/2 degrees for one patient. The combination of gantry, aSi detector panel, and x-ray tube blockage effects during the CBCT acquisition resulted in a registration error of approximately 3 mm. No skin-tone or surface deformation effects were seen with the limited patient sample. CONCLUSIONS: AlignRT3C can be used as a nonionizing IGSPS with accuracy comparable to current image/marker-based systems. IGSPS and CBCT can be combined for high-precision positioning without the need for patient-attached localization devices.",cancer

BACKGROUND: To test whether intratumoral gene expression levels and germline polymorphisms predict clinical outcome in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients treated with cetuximab and bevacizumab plus irinotecan (CBI) vs. cetuximab and bevacizumab (CB)(BOND2). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted for genotyping from 65 patients (31: CBI arm and 34: CB arm). Thirty five patients had tissue samples available for the gene expression assay (18: CBI arm and 17: CB arm). RESULTS: High intratumoral gene expression levels of EGFR, VEGFR2 and NRP1 were associated with longer overall survival (OS) in patients receiving combined monoclonal antibodies with or without irinotecan. FCGR3A V158F, CyclinD1 A870G and EGFR R497K polymorphisms are associated with clinical outcome in patients received combined cetuximab and bevacizumab. CONCLUSIONS: Intratumoral gene expression levels of EGFR, VEGFR2 and NRP as well as polymorphisms in FCGR3A, CyclinD1 and EGFR could predict clinical outcome in mCRC patients enrolled in BOND2, independent of KRAS mutation status.",cancer

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinical activity of weekly topotecan plus carboplatin in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal carcinoma. METHODS: An open-label, single-arm, multicenter Phase I/II study. Phase II was the activity assessment phase, with overall response rate (ORR) as the primary endpoint. Eligible patients (females aged >/=18 years) received study treatment at the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) identified in Phase I: intravenous topotecan 2.5mg/m(2) (Days 1 and 8), followed by carboplatin AUC 5 (Day 1), every 21 days. A two-stage Green-Dahlberg design was used to assess efficacy of treatment. An ORR of </=30% was required to conclude that treatment was ineffective. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients in Phase I permitted identification of the MTD. In Phase II, 55 patients (median age 64.0 years) were enrolled and included in the intent-to-treat population. There were six complete responses (10.9%) and 11 partial responses (20.0%), giving an ORR of 30.9% (17 patients; 95% CI: 18.7%, 43.1%). Median time to response and progression-free survival were 6.57 weeks (95% CI: 5.86, 12.57) and 44.29 weeks (95% CI: 36.14, 52.14), respectively. Grade 3/4 hematological toxicity caused dose reductions, treatment delays and study discontinuation. Neutropenia (Grade 3: 29%; Grade 4: 11%) was the most common hematological adverse event (AE). Fatigue (71%) and nausea (71%) were the most common drug-related non-hematologic AEs. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed an acceptable benefit-risk profile for topotecan plus carboplatin. Further studies using alternative dose levels could help define an optimal dosing schedule for this treatment combination in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent disease.",cancer
"Aortic root reoperations after pulmonary autograft implantation. OBJECTIVE: To report the results of aortic root reoperations after pulmonary autograft implantation. METHODS: All consecutive patients in our prospective Ross research database were selected for analysis, and additional information for patients requiring reoperation was obtained from the hospital records. RESULTS: From 1988 to 2009, 155 pulmonary autograft operations were performed. During this period, 41 patients required reoperation for aortic root dilatation and/or autograft valve insufficiency, in 8 patients combined with pulmonary allograft dysfunction. The freedom from autograft reoperation rate was 86% (standard error, 3.3%) after 10 years and 52% (standard error, 6.6%) after 15 years. The median interval to reoperation was 15.3 years. During reoperation, 39 patients underwent aortic root replacement (mechanical conduit, 31; stentless root, 2; allograft, 3; and valve sparing, 3), and 2 patients underwent valve replacement. In 8 patients this was combined with pulmonary allograft replacement. The technical difficulties encountered included bleeding at the sternal re-entry in 5 patients. No 30-day mortality occurred. The postoperative complications included reexploration for persistent blood loss in 3 patients and cerebrovascular accident in 3 patients. Two patients died during the follow-up period. The survival rate after reoperation was 94% (standard error, 4.1%) at 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: An increasing number of patients requires reoperation after pulmonary autograft implantation. These reoperations can be done with very low mortality and morbidity and excellent follow-up results.",nocancer
"Prostate cancer topography and patterns of lymph node metastasis. Pelvic lymph node (LN) metastasis is a well-recognized route of prostate cancer spread. However, the relationship between topography and the pathologic features of primary prostatic cancers and patterns of pelvic LN metastasis has not been well studied. We reviewed original slides of radical prostatectomies and pelvic LN dissections from 125 patients with LN metastasis and recorded a total number of LN excised/laterality of positive LN, and localization, staging parameters, lymphovascular invasion, and volume of primary tumors. LN QUANTITY AND DISTRIBUTION: 14.6 (mean) and 13 (median) LNs were resected. Seventy-six (61%), 33 (26%), and 16 (13%) cases had 1, 2, and >2 positive LNs; whereas 58, 44, and 20 cases had LN metastasis on the right, left, and bilaterally. PATHOLOGIC FEATURES: Eighty-six percent (108 of 125) and 37% (46 of 125) of the cases showed extraprostatic extension and seminal vesicle invasion, whereas 64% cases showed lymphovascular invasion. Mean and median total tumor volumes were 6.39 and 3.92 cm, with >/=50% and >/=90% Gleason patterns 4/5 in 105 (84%) and 73 (58%) cases, respectively. CORRELATION WITH DOMINANT TUMOR LOCATION: Dominant lesions on radical prostatectomy were as follows: 50 right lobe, 44 left lobe, and 31 bilateral lobe tumors. Fifteen of 50 (30%) right lobe and 18 of 44 (41%) left lobe dominant tumors had LN metastasis on the contralateral side. Only 4% (5 of 125) of the cases were associated with anterior dominant tumors. CONCLUSION: Thirty percent to 40% of LN metastases occurred contralateral to the dominant tumor. LN metastasis is overwhelmingly associated with high-grade, high-stage, and large volume disease. LN positivity is rarely associated with anterior dominant tumors.",cancer
"Dermoscopic island: a new descriptor for thin melanoma. OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency and the features of the dermoscopic island (DI) in melanocytic lesions and to assess its specificity for the diagnosis of melanoma. Dermoscopy improves the diagnostic accuracy of melanoma, but only a few dermoscopic descriptors specific for thin melanomas have been identified. We defined a new descriptor, the dermoscopic island, a well-circumscribed area showing a uniform dermoscopic pattern that differs from the rest of the pigmented lesion. DESIGN: Dermoscopic images of 96 in situ melanomas, 266 invasive melanomas, and 612 dermoscopic atypical nevi were evaluated to establish the presence and the main pattern of the DI. Also, clinical and histologic characteristics were analyzed. SETTING: Dermoscopic images were collected from lesions excised between 2003 and 2008 at the Department of Dermatology, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Specificity and odds ratio for melanoma; dermoscopic and histologic characteristics of lesions with a DI. RESULTS: The DI was present in 10.4% of in situ melanomas, 4.1% of invasive melanomas, and 3.1% of dermoscopic atypical nevi. The odds ratio for melanoma was 1.922, and specificity was 96.9%. Invasive melanomas with a DI were thinner than those lacking this descriptor. In addition, more than half of the melanomas with a DI arose on a nevus. The DI appeared mainly reticular on a reticular background. CONCLUSION: The DI is characteristic of thin melanoma arising in a nevus; thus, it can be considered a potential early sign of transformation of a nevus into a melanoma.",cancer
"Preoperative CA 125 tumour marker in endometrial cancer: correlation with advanced stage disease. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if a preoperative serum CA 125 level>or=35 kU/L in patients with endometrial cancer correlates with a surgical stage III or IV and poor histopathological prognostic factors. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 254 patients who underwent hysterectomy and full staging for endometrial cancer. Preoperative serum CA 125 was available for each patient as well as complete clinical and histopathological data. Chi-square, Fisher exact test, multivariate logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic curve curves were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: A total of 186 (73%) patients had stage I or II disease and 68 (27%) had stage III or IV disease. A statistically higher number of patients from the stage III or IV group had a serum CA 125 level>or=35 kU/L (58%) compared with the stage I or II group (16%) (OR 7.44; P<0.001). There was no correlation between serum CA 125 level and histological subtype. Patients with stage I or II disease and serum CA 125>or=35 kU/L (46%) had significantly more frequent deep myometrial invasion (>50%) than did those with serum CA 125<35 kU/L (18%) (OR 3.68; P=0.006). CONCLUSION: Assay of the preoperative serum CA 125 level is a very simple test to detect patients with more advanced stage endometrial adenocarcinoma. Its routine use could help triage high risk patients preoperatively.",cancer
"Pediatric anaplastic large cell lymphoma presenting as generalized lymphadenopathy. Because a finding of generalized lymphadenopathy can be associated with such a wide range of diseases and conditions, determining its cause can sometimes be challenging. Infectious causes are the most common; however, it is important also to consider other entities in the workup. Here we present the case of a 3-year-old girl with generalized lymphadenopathy and fever, in whom the cause of the symptoms was initially thought to be infectious. Ultimately, however, anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) was diagnosed. Using this case as a backdrop, we discuss the wide range of systemic illnesses that the differential diagnosis of generalized lymphadenopathy encompasses--including infectious, autoimmune, and oncological disorders. We discuss the different findings typically seen in the various entities that figure prominently in the differential, and we outline investigations that can help narrow it. Finally, we present an overview of ALCL, one of the more rare pediatric malignancies.",cancer
"Mortality among U.S. astronauts: 1980-2009. INTRODUCTION: It has been nearly 20 yr since the first published astronaut mortality analysis. Using astronaut vital data and general population mortality rates, we calculate Standardized Mortality Ratios (SMR) for both total and specific causes of death among astronauts between January 1980 and June 2009 to look for changes in mortality patterns over time. METHODS: Astronaut vital data were derived from the Johnson Space Center website and the Astronaut Fact Book. General population mortality rates were taken from the Human Mortality Database and the Centers for Disease Control. SMR were computed as the ratio of observed deaths to expected deaths using indirect standardization to several comparison populations. RESULTS: All SMR declined from the 1980s to the 2000s, though astronauts are still at increased risk of accidental death (SMR = 574, 95% C.I. 335-919). Astronauts are at greatly reduced risk of death by cardiovascular disease (SMR = 27, 95% C.I. 9-63) and cancer (SMR = 47, 95% C.I. 19-97), and astronauts are now at decreased risk of all-cause mortality compared with the general population. DISCUSSION: The SMR show that mortality from circulatory disease, cancer, and accidents have all declined from previous estimates, though astronauts are still at increased risk of accidental death. Improvements in circulatory disease mortality are likely due to intensive health screening and physical fitness within the Astronaut Corps. Similarly, physical fitness may be contributing to the reduction in cancer mortality. Fewer airplane crashes have contributed to the decreased risk of fatal accidents, which in turn is driving the reduction in all-cause mortality risk.",cancer
"Determinants of age at menarche in the UK: analyses from the Breakthrough Generations Study. BACKGROUND: Early menarche increases breast cancer risk but, aside from weight, information on its determinants is limited. METHODS: Age at menarche data were collected retrospectively by questionnaire from 81,606 women aged 16-98, resident in the UK and participating in the Breakthrough Generations Study. RESULTS: Menarche occurred earlier in women who had a low birthweight (P(trend)<0.001), were singletons (P<0.001), had prenatal exposure to pre-eclampsia (P<0.001) or maternal smoking (P=0.01), were not breastfed (P(trend)=0.03), were non-white (P<0.001), were heavy (P(trend)<0.001) or tall (P(trend)<0.001) compared with their peers at age 7 and exercised little as a child (P(trend)<0.001). Menarcheal age increased with number of siblings (P<0.001) independently of birth order, and had an inverse association with birth order after adjustment for sibship size (P<0.001). In a multivariate model, birthweight, ethnicity, weight, height, exercise, sibship size and birth order remained significant, and maternal age at birth became significant (positive association, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Age at menarche was influenced by both pre- and post-natal factors, and these factors may affect breast cancer risk through this route.",cancer
"Baby EAR circuit: a clinical determination of optimal fresh gas flow in spontaneous breathing anesthesia. BACKGROUND: Baby EAR circuit is a new modified enclosed afferent reservoir anesthetic breathing system invented to use in pediatric patients. By following His Majesty the King of Thailand's self-sufficiency philosophy, the circuit is simplymade of low-cost and easy-to-find materials in the operating room. OBJECTIVE: Investigate clinical use of the circuit and to find the optimal fresh gas flow in spontaneous breathing anesthesia. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A prospective descriptive study was conducted in pediatric patients, who weighed 5-20 kg, anesthetized for surgery and divided into three groups of body weight: groups I (5 - <10 kg), groups II (10 - <15 kg), groups III (15-20 kg). The Baby EAR circuit was used for general anesthesia with endotracheal tube and spontaneous breathing. Different fresh gas flow of 4, 3.5, 3, 2.5, 2, and 1.5 liter per minute (LPM) was used consecutively The authors recorded end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO) and mean inspiratory carbon dioxide (ImCO2) while using fresh gas flow at 4, 3.5, 3, 2.5, 2, and 1.5 LPM. EtCO2 of 35-60 mmHg and ImCO2 of <6 mmHg were considered clinically acceptable. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were enrolled in the present study Mean value (95% CI) of EtCO2, ImCO2 and fresh gas flow rate in group I were 42 +/- 3.2 (39.8, 44.2), 3 +/- 1.2 (2.2, 3.8) mmHg, and 1.7 +/- 0.6 (1.2, 2.1) LPM respectively. Mean value (95% CI) of EtCO2 ImCO2 and fresh gas flow rate in group II were 50 +/- 5.6 (47.2, 52.8), 3 +/- 0.9 (2.6, 3.4) mmHg, 2 +/- 0.4 (1.8, 2.2) LPM respectively. Mean value (95% CI) EtCO, ImCO2 and fresh gas flow rate in group III were 51 +/- 7.2 (46.7, 55.3), 2 +/- 1 (1.4, 2.6) mmHg, and 2 +/- 0.3 (1.8, 2.2) LPM respectively. No patients had serious complications in the present study. CONCLUSION: Baby EAR circuit can be made economically and used safelyfor general anesthesia with spontaneous breathing in pediatric patients who weighed 5-20 kg at optimal fresh gas flow rate of > or = 2.5 LPM",nocancer
"The aging kidney: structural changes. A number of structural changes occur in the kidney with aging. The aging kidney is characterized by loss of renal mass, arterial sclerosis, arteriolar hyalinosis, an increased number of sclerotic glomeruli, loss of tubules and interstitial fibrosis. The pathogenesis of aging-associated structural changes is not completely understood. Both genetic background and hemodynamic factors have been associated with progression of age-related morphological changes. The structural changes of aging kidney are nonspecific and can be seen in many conditions, including diabetes and hypertension, and, as such, arterionephrosclerosis of aging is a diagnosis of exclusion.",nocancer
"Neediness and narcissistic defensive action. Action-prone patients are difficult for most analysts to treat. The author describes patients who act in treatment by pressuring themselves and the analyst to get rid of what is wrong, to change the imperative, life-and-death qualities of need into something else. Viewing neediness in treatment as narcissistic defensive action helps the analyst address the patient's pressured flight away from focusing on the need of the analyst and toward action aimed at riddance. Ghent's (1992, 1993) views on neediness are discussed and seen to be complemented by a view of action as protection against narcissistic vulnerability. Analysts' intolerance, vulnerabilities, and needs with such patients are considered.",nocancer
"Culture of omentum-induced regenerating liver yielded hepatocyte-committed stem cells. Earlier we showed that when omentum, activated by inert particles, is allowed to fuse to a wedge cut in the liver, it induces stem cell proliferation in the liver resulting in massive liver regeneration. Here, we attempt to culture stem cells from the omentum-induced regenerating liver tissue. Cells from regenerating liver tissue were harvested and cultured. Cultured cells were characterized by immune staining, fluorescence activated cell sorting analysis, growth factor assay, in vitro differentiation, and their ability to engraft to injured sites in vivo. Culture yielded cells with a mesenchymal stem cell phenotype that could be maintained in culture indefinitely. These cells, called regenerating liver stem cells, expressed both adult and embryonic stem cell markers, secreted high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor, and expressed albumin. When grown on matrigel in the presence of hepatocyte growth factor, these cells differentiated into hepatocyte-like cells in culture, but they did not differentiate to adipogenic and osteogenic lineages when grown in specific differentiation medium. The differentiated cells expressed alpha-fetoprotein and secreted high levels of albumin and urea. After systemic injection, the undifferentiated cells engrafted only to the injured sites in the liver and not to the normal areas of the liver. In conclusion, omentum-induced regenerating liver yields hepatocyte-committed stem cells in culture. Such cells could prove to be useful in cell transplantation therapies.",cancer
"Seroprevalence of hantavirus antibodies among chronic hemodialysis patients in the Czech Republic. A total of 348 serum samples were collected from 301 hemodialysis patients with chronic renal failure of four healthcare settings in Western Bohemia. The sera were screened for the presence of hantavirus antibodies using ELISA kits (PROGEN Biotechnik GmbH) with Hantaan and Puumala antigens. Specific anti-Puumala antibodies were detected in five patients (1.7%). Although hantaviruses are known to cause primarily acute renal damage (interstitial nephritis) in Eurasia, chronic effects of hantavirus infection and the detection of specific antibodies in hemodialysis patients have also been reported. Nonetheless, the detection of seropositivity is not proof of an etiological link between hantaviruses and chronic renal failure. The hantavirus seropositivity rate in hemodialysis patients was not significantly higher than that in the general population. Our findings are consistent with the literature data and do not contradict the contribution of hantaviruses to the pathogenesis of chronic renal damage in the Czech Republic.",nocancer
"Stereotactic radiosurgery for pediatric recurrent intracranial ependymomas. OBJECT: To evaluate the role of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in patients with recurrent or residual intracranial ependymomas after resection and fractionated radiation therapy (RT), the authors assessed overall survival, distant tumor relapse, progression-free survival (PFS), and complications. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed the records of 21 children with ependymomas who underwent SRS for 32 tumors. There were 17 boys and 4 girls with a median age of 6.9 years (range 2.9-17.2 years) in the patient population. All patients underwent resection of an ependymoma followed by cranial or neuraxis (if spinal metastases was confirmed) RT. Eleven patients had adjuvant chemotherapy. Twelve patients had low-grade ependymomas (17 tumors), and 9 patients had anaplastic ependymomas (15 tumors). The median radiosurgical target volume was 2.2 cm(3) (range 0.1-21.4 cm(3)), and the median dose to the tumor margin was 15 Gy (range 9-22 Gy). RESULTS: Follow-up imaging demonstrated therapeutic control in 23 (72%) of 32 tumors at a mean follow-up period of 27.6 months (range 6.1-72.8 months). Progression-free survival after the initial SRS was 78.4%, 55.5%, and 41.6% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. Factors associated with a longer PFS included patients without spinal metastases (p = 0.033) and tumor volumes < 2.2 cm(3) (median tumor volume 2.2 cm(3), p = 0.029). An interval >/= 18 months between RT and SRS was also associated with longer survival (p = 0.035). The distant tumor relapse rate despite RT and SRS was 33.6%, 41.0%, and 80.3% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. Factors associated with a higher rate of distant tumor relapse included patients who had spinal metastases before RT (p = 0.037), a fourth ventricle tumor location (p = 0.002), and an RT to SRS interval < 18 months (p = 0.015). The median survival after SRS was 27.6 months (95% CI 19.33-35.87 months). Overall survival after SRS was 85.2%, 53.2%, and 23.0% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. Adverse radiation effects developed in 2 patients (9.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic radiosurgery offers an additional option beyond repeat surgery or RT in pediatric patients with residual or recurrent ependymomas after initial management. Patients with smaller-volume tumors and a later recurrence responded best to radiosurgery.",cancer

"A histology-based model for predicting microsatellite instability in colorectal cancers. Identifying colorectal cancers (CRCs) with high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI-H) is clinically important. MSI-H is a positive prognostic marker for CRC, a predictive marker for resistance to standard 5-fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy, and an important feature for identifying individuals and families with Lynch syndrome. Our aim was to compare and improve upon the existing predictive pathology models for MSI-H CRCs. We tested 2 existing models used to predict MSI-H tumors, (1) Revised Bethesda Guidelines and (2) MsPath, in our population-based cohort of CRCs diagnosed less than 75 years from Newfoundland (N=710). We also scored additional histologic features not described in the other models. From this analysis, we developed a model for the prediction of MSI-H CRCs; Pathologic Role in Determination of Instability in Colorectal Tumors (PREDICT). An independent pathologist validated this model in a second cohort of all CRCs (N=276). Tumor histology was a better predictor of MSI status than was personal and family history of cancer. MsPath identified MSI-H CRCs with a sensitivity of 92.1% and a specificity of 37.8%, whereas the Revised Bethesda Guidelines had a sensitivity of 81.3% and a specificity of 39.5%. PREDICT included some new histology features, including peritumoral lymphocytic reaction and increased proportion of plasma cells in the tumor stroma. PREDICT was superior to both existing models in the development cohort with a sensitivity of 97.4% and a specificity of 53.9%. In the validation cohort, sensitivity was 96.9% and specificity 76.6%. We conclude that PREDICT is a good predictor of MSI-H CRC.",cancer
"Spectrum of pilomyxoid astrocytomas: intermediate pilomyxoid tumors. To define the spectrum of pilomyxoid morphology and to characterize the association between pilomyxoid astrocytoma (PMA) and pilocytic astrocytoma (PA), 84 cases of pediatric astrocytomas with pilomyxoid features were reviewed. Forty-two of these tumors had coexistent features of PMA and PA (""intermediate""). With the accumulation of more cytoplasm, fibrillar background, microcysts, and thickened blood vessels, these intermediate tumors were more PA-like and less like classic PMA. In the recurrent specimens, PMAs and intermediate tumors sometimes showed more prominent PA features. Both PMA and intermediate tumors involved sites outside the hypothalamus, optic chiasm, and the third ventricle. Both the existence of intermediate tumors and the finding that some PMAs and intermediate tumors mature into PA-like neoplasms over time, provided strong support for a biological relationship between PMA and PA. Additional evidence for a ""maturational effect"" was the finding that intermediate tumors occurred in patients with a median age of 36 months compared with the median age of 21 months for those with PMAs (P=0.017). Features that were often assumed to be poor prognostic indicators in gliomas, that is, necrosis, mitotic figures, and vascular proliferation, were not uncommon in typical PMAs and intermediate lesions. Further follow-up is needed to more accurately determine the prognosis of intermediate tumors.",cancer
"Irinotecan/fluorouracil/leucovorin or the same regimen followed by oxaliplatin/fluorouracil/leucovorin in metastatic colorectal cancer. BACKGROUND: This study reports the long-term follow-up of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) participating in a randomised phase II study that compared the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of irinotecan (IRI), fluorouracil (FU) with leucovorin (LV) (arm A) versus sequential chemotherapy with IRI plus FU/LV followed by oxaliplatin (OXA) plus FU/LV (arm B) as first line therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Intent-to-treat analysis was performed on 417 patients (211 in arm A and 206 in arm B). Treatment schedules of weekly IRI 80 mg/m(2) or OXA 45 mg/m(2) plus LV 200 mg/m(2) immediately followed by intravenous bolus FU 450 mg/m(2) for 6 weeks were followed by a 2-week rest period. Treatment continued for 4 cycles. Patients in arm A were treated with IRI/FU/LV for 4 cycles, while patients in arm B were initially treated with IRI/FU/LV for 2 cycles followed by sequential administration of 2 cycles of OXA/FU/LV. RESULTS: No significant difference emerged in overall response rate or overall survival. There was a difference in progression-free survival (median, 7.3 versus 8.2 months, p=0.040) in favour of arm B. Toxicity profiles were similar in both arms. CONCLUSION: IRI/FU/LV and IRI/FU/LV followed by OXA/FU/LV showed comparable activity with a manageable toxicity profile.",cancer
"Expectations, experiences and attitudes of orthopedic patients undergoing arthroscopic cruciate ligament reconstruction toward postoperative pain and its management. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate expectations, experiences, and attitudes of orthopedic patients undergoing arthroscopic cruciate ligament reconstruction in terms of postoperative pain and management. MATERIAL AND METHOD: This prospective study involved 115 patients. Preoperatively, patients completed a preoperative questionnaire regarding expectations toward postoperative pain and management. Postoperatively, they completed a postoperative questionnaire regarding exact pain experiences and attitudes in relation to their pain and management. RESULTS: Almost all expected (95.6%) and experienced (98.3%) pain. The median values of maximum and average pain measured by a verbal numerical rating score were 7.7 and 5.6, respectively. Approximately 3/5 reported marked and maximum relief from analgesics received Only one patient was not satisfied with pain management while the rest were satisfied in varying degrees. A large proportion showed incorrect conceptions concerning postoperative pain and management. CONCLUSION: Postoperative pain management is still an area for improvement. Misunderstandings of patients should be explored and corrected as they can pose a barrier for effective pain relief Pain management should begin with preoperative explanations and advice followed by good care intraoperatively and postoperatively.",nocancer
"Subclinical cardiac dysfunction and exercise performance in childhood cancer survivors. BACKGROUND: Although anthracycline cardiotoxicity is clearly related to the cumulative dose administered, subclinical cardiac dysfunction has been reported across a wide range of treatment regimens, and its clinical significance is still unclear. Purpose of this study is to investigate by exercise echocardiography for subclinical cardiac dysfunction in survivors of pediatric cancer treated with low-moderate anthracycline doses, and to evaluate whether it may alter the response of the cardiovascular system to dynamic exercise. PROCEDURE: Post-exercise left ventricular end-systolic wall stress (ESS), left ventricular posterior wall dimension and percent thickening at end systole, and cardiopulmonary exercise test-derived indexes of cardiac function were examined in 55 apparently healthy patients (mean age 13.5 +/- 2.9 years, median anthracycline cumulative dose 240 mg/m(2)) and in 63 controls. RESULTS: Subclinical cardiac dysfunction was identified in 17 patients (30%) presenting reduced left ventricular posterior wall dimension or percent thickening, or increased values of left ventricular ESS as compared to controls (group A), while the remaining patients formed group B. Reduced oxygen consumption at peak exercise in both groups of patients was the only cardiopulmonary exercise test variable resulting significantly different between patients and controls: no differences were found among the groups of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that even patients treated with a median anthracycline dose of 240 mg/m(2) (range 100-490) are at considerable risk of exhibiting subclinical cardiac dysfunction that, however, does not seem to alter the physiologic response of the cardiovascular system to dynamic exercise.",cancer
"Overexpression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 gene correlates with poor outcomes in colorectal cancer. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) is a major endogenous regulator of matrix metalloproteinases. This study examined the relation between TIMP-1 gene expression and postoperative mortality in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Specimens of CRC were obtained from 202 patients. The relative expression levels of TIMP-1 mRNA in cancer and in normal adjacent mucosa were measured by quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The expression level of the TIMP-1 gene was categorized as low or high according to the median value. The TIMP-1 level did not correlate with any clinicopathological feature. On Kaplan-Meier analysis, the 5-year overall survival rate was significantly lower in patients with high TIMP-1 (62.6%) than in those with low TIMP-1 (80.6%; p=0.0113). High TIMP-1 mRNA expression was associated with significantly poorer overall survival on univariate Cox regression analysis (p=0.0013) and multivariate analysis (p=0.0070). Overexpression of TIMP-1 thus correlated with poor outcomes in patients with CRC. Our results suggest that the TIMP-1 gene expression level might be a useful, independent prognostic factor in CRC.",cancer
"The clinical significance of HPV screening in premalignant cervical lesions. PURPOSE: We evaluated the clinical significance of human papilloma virus (HPV) screening in premalignant cervical lesions. METHODS: This prospective study was performed at Dicle University, School of Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, from January 2009 to June 2009. A total of 60 cases were evaluated. Thirty cases had premalignant cervical lesions. The prevalence of HPV was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and types determined by Hybrid Capture II. The cases that had premalignant cervical lesions were evaluated with colposcopy. Statistical analyses were carried out by using the statistical packages for SPSS version 12.0 for Windows (Chicago, IL, USA). RESULTS: Of all the cases, those with premalignant cervical lesions had higher prevalence of HPV DNA. The cases that had high oncogenic HPV type had more abnormal colposcopic findings. CONCLUSION: Premalignant cervical lesions should be evaluated by cervical cytology, colposcopy, HPV DNA screening and cervical tissue sampling. In this way, development of cervical cancer can be prevented.",cancer
"The Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study 2008: study design and methods. OBJECTIVE: Describe the study design, data collection methods, 24-hour dietary recall protocol, and sample characteristics of the Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study (FITS) 2008. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study designed to obtain information on the diets and feeding patterns of US infants, toddlers, and preschoolers ages birth to 47 months. Telephone interviews with parents and caregivers were conducted from June 2008 through January 2009 and included a household interview to recruit the household and collect information on household and child demographics and nutrition-related characteristics, and a dietary interview, including a 24-hour dietary recall collected using the 2008 Nutrition Data System for Research. A second dietary recall was collected on a random subsample to estimate usual nutrient intake distributions. Data collection instruments were built on those used in FITS 2002, with expanded survey content to address emerging issues in childhood nutrition and obesity. The dietary protocol was improved to increase reporting accuracy on portion sizes, and a bridging study was conducted to test effects of the changes in the food model booklet and protocol since FITS 2002 (n=240 cases aged 4 to 23 months). SUBJECTS: A national random sample of 3,273 infants, toddlers, and preschoolers from birth up to age 4 years, with 2 days of dietary intake data for 701 cases. RESULTS: Among sampled households with an age-eligible child, the response rate was 60% for the recruitment interview. Of recruited households, the response rate for the dietary interview was 78%. CONCLUSIONS: The FITS 2008 provides rigorous, well-tested methods and survey questions for nutrition researchers to use in other dietary studies of young children. FITS 2008 findings on the food and nutrient intakes of US children from birth up to age 4 years can inform dietetics practitioners, pediatric health practitioners, and policymakers about the dietary issues of young children.",nocancer
"Methylation-mediated silencing of TMS1 in pancreatic cancer and its potential contribution to chemosensitivity. BACKGROUND: Resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, resulting in part from epigenetic silencing of pro-apoptotic genes, is one of the causes of treatment failure of pancreatic cancer. We examined whether epigenetic silencing of target of methylation induced silencing 1 (TMS1) contributes to resistance to chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Methylation analysis was performed by methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR) and gene expression was analyzed by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). MIA PaCa-2 cells were transfected with pCMV6-XL5/TMS1 plasmid and the effect of TMS1 expression on sensitivity to gemcitabine and docetaxel was determined. Cell viability was measured using Cell Titer Blue assay. RESULTS: TMS1 expression was repressed in MIA PaCa-2 cells by DNA methylation. Up-regulation of TMS1 by recombinant gene expression in MIA PaCa-2 cells or by pre-treatment of these cells with 5-azacytidine resulted in enhanced sensitivity to gemcitabine and docetaxel. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that TMS1 is a potential therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer.",cancer
"Progress toward poliomyelitis eradication --- India, January 2009-October 2010. India is one of only four countries (including Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan) where wild poliovirus (WPV) transmission has never been interrupted. Historically, WPV transmission in India has centered largely in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, two states with low routine vaccination coverage, large migrant and remote populations, and lower relative vaccine effectiveness than other areas of the country. However, during a 9-month period from November 2009 to August 2010, no WPV type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in Uttar Pradesh or Bihar. This report summarizes the substantial progress made in India toward polio eradication during January 2009-October 2010, according to data reported as of December 4, and updates previous reports. During January-October 2010, only 40 WPV cases were confirmed in India, a 94% decrease from the 626 WPV cases confirmed during the same period in 2009; the decrease likely resulted, in large part, from the introduction of bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine types 1 and 3 (bOPV). Increasingly important contributors to WPV transmission are large migrant subpopulations; surveys have indicated that up to 11% of children aged <5 years in these subpopulations were missed during supplementary immunization activities (SIAs). Interruption of all WPV transmission in India will require maintaining high levels of immunity in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and additional efforts directed toward children in migrant subpopulations that are not vaccinated as readily during SIAs.",nocancer
"Preoperative eye disinfection in vitrectomy surgery using antibiotic or antiseptic eyedrops. PURPOSE: To determine the efficacy of preoperative eye disinfection by comparing antibiotic and antiseptic eye drops. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized double-masked comparative study with three study arms: untreated, antibiotic treated and antiseptic treated. METHODS: Patients that were scheduled for vitrectomy were asked to use an antibiotic or antiseptic eye drop 4 times a day, 5 days before the surgery. Conjunctival smear was cultured at the onset of the surgery. Culture results for each study arm were compared. RESULTS: Comparable results were found in the patients treated with an antibiotic or antiseptic eye drop. CONCLUSIONS: Since an antiseptic eye drop will cause less bacterial resistance than an antibiotic eye drop, and both treatments have a similar antibacterial effect, this study indicates that prophylactic antiseptic eye drops may be preferred over antibiotic treatment, when prophylaxis is needed.",nocancer
"The odd effect and multiple meanings in English of the words ""odd"" and ""even"". Under a variety of conditions, people take longer to make judgments about odd than about even digits and digit names. In English the words ""odd"" and ""even"" have multiple meanings. Perhaps the multiple meanings of these words are responsible for the slowing of responses to odd stimuli. This hypothesis was tested using participants who spoke no English and in whose native language, Polish, the words for the mathematical concepts of odd and even do not have multiple meanings.",nocancer
"A phase II study of metronomic oral topotecan for recurrent childhood brain tumors. BACKGROUND: The prognosis for recurrent or refractory brain tumors in children is poor with conventional therapies. Topotecan is a topoisomerase I inhibitor with good central nervous system (CNS) penetration following oral administration. Increased efficacy of topotecan has been demonstrated with prolonged low-dose daily treatment in pre-clinical models. To investigate further this drug delivered orally in pediatric CNS malignancies, a phase II study in children with recurrent or refractory brain tumors was performed. PROCEDURE: Patients </= 21 years of age at diagnosis with a recurrent, progressive, or refractory primary CNS malignancy and measurable disease, were eligible. Patients enrolled into four strata: ependymoma (N = 4), high-grade glioma (HGG) (N = 6), brainstem glioma (BSG) (N = 13), and primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) (N = 8). Oral topotecan was administered once daily at a dose of 0.8 mg/m(2)/day for 21 consecutive days repeated every 28 days. Response and toxicity profiles were evaluated. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were evaluable (median age 9.2 years; 10 males). Two objective responses were observed in PNET patients with disseminated tumor at study entry. These two patients remain alive and in remission 7 and 9.5 years off study. Four other patients (two BSG, one PNET, and one HGG) had stable disease (median 4.6 months). The most common toxicities were hematologic. CONCLUSIONS: Daily oral topotecan at a dose of 0.8 mg/m(2)/day can be safely administered to children with recurrent or refractory brain tumors. This regimen identified activity in recurrent PNET. The prolonged progression free survival (PFS) in two PNET patients justifies consideration of this regimen in more advanced clinical trials.",cancer
"Relationship between intraoperative fluid administration and perioperative outcome after pancreaticoduodenectomy: results of a prospective randomized trial of acute normovolemic hemodilution compared with standard intraoperative management. BACKGROUND: Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) can be associated with significant blood loss and transfusion requirements, with potential adverse short- and long-term consequences. The aim of this study was to determine whether acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH), an established blood conservation technique, reduces perioperative allogeneic transfusions in patients undergoing PD. METHODS: One hundred thirty patients undergoing PD were randomized to ANH or standard management (STDM). In the ANH group, intraoperative blood collection was performed to a target hemoglobin of 8.0 g/dL; crystalloid and colloid were used for volume replacement. Strict transfusion triggers were applied during and after operation. Perioperative complications were prospectively assessed and graded for severity. RESULTS: From July 2005 to May 2009, 209 patients were registered, 79 excluded, 65 were randomized to ANH, and 65 to STD. The groups were well matched for demographic, operative, and histopathologic variables. Patients undergoing ANH received over 2 L more fluid intraoperatively (6250 mL, range 2000-11850) compared with patients undergoing STD (3900 mL, range 2000-9000) (P < 0.001). Transfusion rates were similar (ANH = 16.9%, 30 units vs STD = 18.5%, 33 units; P = 0.82), as was overall perioperative morbidity (ANH = 49.2% vs STD = 47%, P = 0.86). There was, however, a trend toward more grade-3 complications in patients undergoing ANH (32% vs 23.1% STD, P = 0.17), and complications related to the pancreatic anastomosis (leak/fistula/abscess) were significantly higher in the ANH group (21.5% vs 7.7%, P = 0.045). The intraoperative fluid volume was higher for all patients with pancreatic anastomotic complications (n = 19), regardless of randomization arm (ANH 6000 mL, range 2800-11350 mL vs STD 5000 mL, range 2000-11850 mL, P < 0.042). CONCLUSION: In this randomized trial of patients undergoing PD, ANH did not reduce allogeneic transfusions and resulted in more pancreatic anastomotic complications, likely related to greater intraoperative fluid administration. The benefits of ANH do not necessarily extend to all procedures, and restrictive intravenous fluid management during PD may help improve postoperative outcome.",nocancer

"Systematic review of laryngeal reinnervation techniques. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review outcomes of reinnervation techniques for the management of unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP). DATA SOURCES: Medline and Cochrane databases for English-language studies published between 1966 and 2009 on the surgical management of UVFP. REVIEW METHODS: Studies were excluded if they reported on bilateral vocal fold paralysis, used nonhuman subjects, or did not assess clinical outcomes. Outcomes of interest were visual analysis, acoustic analysis, perceptual analysis, and electromyography. RESULTS: Of 686 initial studies, 14 studies encompassing 329 patients were eligible for analysis. All studies had a case-series design. Of reported patients, 60.2 percent were men, with mean age of 51 years (range, 12-79 years). The most common reinnervation technique was ansa cervicalis-to-recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN), which was most commonly performed after thyroidectomy (43.5%). Other techniques with reportable outcomes included primary RLN anastomosis, ansa-to-RLN combined with cricothyroid muscle-nerve-muscle pedicle, ansa-to-thyroarytenoid neural implantation, ansa-to-thyroarytenoid neuromuscular pedicle, and hypoglossal-to-RLN. Median postsurgical follow-up was 12 months, and mean time to first signs of reinnervation was 4.5 months (SD 2.9 months). Visual analysis of glottic gap showed the greatest mean improvement with ansa-to-RLN, from 2.25 (SD 0.886) to 0.75 (SD 0.886) mm (P < 0.01). Acoustic analysis showed greatest improvement with neural implantation, with a change in mean phonation time from seven (SD 1.22) to 16 (SD 5.52) seconds (P < 0.01). Perceptual analysis and electromyography demonstrated improvement in all studies. CONCLUSION: Reinnervation is effective in the management of UVFP, although the specific method may be dictated by anatomical limitations. Prospective studies utilizing uniform and consistent outcome parameters are necessary.",nocancer
"Publication misrepresentation among otolaryngology residency applicants. OBJECTIVE: To assess the extent of research publication misrepresentation among otolaryngology residency applicants and to determine applicant attributes associated with misrepresentation. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: A single otolaryngology residency program. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) applications to the incoming 2010 class of an otolaryngology residency program were reviewed for peer-reviewed journal publications reported as ""provisionally accepted,"" ""accepted,"" or ""in print."" Publications were verified by searching PubMed, Google Scholar, and electronic journals. Applicants with remaining unverified publications were e-mailed before announcing interviews. Erroneously reported or unverifiable publications were considered misrepresented. RESULTS: There were 432 publications reported by 173 of 325 applicants (53.2%). Twenty-two publications (5.1%) were misrepresented by 17 applicants (9.8%). Contacting applicants verified 26 publications and identified 10 errors. Seven publications were inappropriately reported as provisionally accepted, three articles were not peer-reviewed, and applicants were erroneously listed as first author on two publications. Ten publications remained unverifiable. Multivariate logistic regression models showed that being an international medical graduate (P = 0.002) and male gender (P = 0.040) were predictors of misrepresentation after adjusting for potential confounders. Among international medical graduates alone, no attributes were associated with misrepresentation. All U.S. applicants with misrepresented publications were male (P = 0.033) and were from a medical school not ranked in the top 50 by U.S. News & World Report for research (P = 0.002) or primary care (P = 0.018). CONCLUSION: Misrepresentation of research experience exists among otolaryngology residency applicants. ERAS should develop standardized definitions for publication statuses to help reduce inadvertent misrepresentation.",nocancer
"PARP-1 attenuates Smad-mediated transcription. The versatile cytokine transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) regulates cellular growth, differentiation, and migration during embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis. Activation of TGF-beta receptors leads to phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3, which oligomerize with Smad4 and accumulate in the nucleus where they recognize gene regulatory regions and orchestrate transcription. Termination of Smad-activated transcription involves Smad dephosphorylation, nuclear export, or ubiquitin-mediated degradation. In an unbiased proteomic screen, we identified poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) as a Smad-interacting partner. PARP-1 dissociates Smad complexes from DNA by ADP-ribosylating Smad3 and Smad4, which attenuates Smad-specific gene responses and TGF-beta-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Thus, our results identify ADP-ribosylation of Smad proteins by PARP-1 as a key step in controlling the strength and duration of Smad-mediated transcription.",nocancer
"Quality management benchmarking: FDA compliance in pharmaceutical industry. PURPOSE: By analyzing and comparing industry and business best practice, processes can be optimized and become more successful mainly because efficiency and competitiveness increase. This paper aims to focus on some examples. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: Case studies are used to show knowledge exchange in the pharmaceutical industry. Best practice solutions were identified in two companies using a benchmarking method and five-stage model. FINDINGS: Despite large administrations, there is much potential regarding business process organization. This project makes it possible for participants to fully understand their business processes. The benchmarking method gives an opportunity to critically analyze value chains (a string of companies or players working together to satisfy market demands for a special product). PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Knowledge exchange is interesting for companies that like to be global players. Benchmarking supports information exchange and improves competitive ability between different enterprises. Findings suggest that the five-stage model improves efficiency and effectiveness. Furthermore, the model increases the chances for reaching targets. The method gives security to partners that did not have benchmarking experience. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The study identifies new quality management procedures. Process management and especially benchmarking is shown to support pharmaceutical industry improvements.",nocancer

"Renal replacement therapy in elderly patients: peritoneal dialysis. Management of chronic uremia in elderly patients presents several clinic and organizational difficulties. Hemodialysis (HD) and chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD) are both available for the elderly, and the choice depends on the individual, clinical and familial conditions. Several reports have compared the outcomes for older patients treated by HD or peritoneal dialysis, with those for younger or older patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis. CPD is a successful dialysis option for elderly patients, in both patient and technique survival terms. All nutritional parameters are of pivotal importance. Several barriers, such as medical and social factors, physician bias, late referral and education irrespective of the needs of older patients, influence the choice of CPD. The development of assisted peritoneal dialysis, using community-based nurses or health care assistants, can overcome some of the barriers and enable frail older patients to have home-based dialysis treatment. Increasing age is associated with higher peritonitis rates among patients who started CPD in the 1990s, while age is not associated with peritonitis in more recent CPD cohorts, and no greater frequency of adverse outcomes of peritonitis has been seen among those who began CPD after the year 2000. In elderly dialysis patients, the management of quality of life (QOL) is important as well as adequacy of dialysis, nutritional status and survival rate. To obtain a good standard of QOL, it is essential to select carers who are properly educated and who can access an adequate support system, both physical and psychological, to help them cope with their burden.",nocancer
"Geriatric psychopharmacology: evolution of a discipline. The development of geriatric psychopharmacology was built on advances in geriatric psychiatry nosology and clinical pharmacology and on increased investment in aging research by the National Institute of Mental Health and by academic institutions. Application of the US Food and Drug Administration's geriatric labeling rule provided further impetus. Developments in the knowledge about 3 principal classes of medications (antidepressants, antipsychotics, and treatments for Alzheimer's disease) illustrate the trajectory of geriatric psychopharmacology research. Nonetheless, the loss of information about age effects that has resulted from applying age exclusion criteria in studies limited to either younger adults or geriatric patients is regrettable. Antidepressant trials have moved from studying younger and medically well ""geriatric"" samples to focusing on ""older old"" persons and those with significant medical comorbidity including coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, and dementia. Increased specificity is reflected in studies of relationships between specific neuropsychological deficits, specific brain abnormalities, and antidepressant responsiveness. Clinical trials in older adults have demonstrated that the efficacy of antipsychotic medications continues across the lifespan, but that sensitivity to specific side effects changes in older age, with poor tolerability frequently mitigating the benefits of treatment. Treatments for Alzheimer's disease have fallen within the purview of geriatric psychopharmacology. The research focus is increasingly shifting from treatments to slow the course of cognitive decline to studies of early diagnosis and of interventions designed to prevent the development of deficits in vulnerable individuals. The importance of geriatric psychopharmacology will grow further as the average lifespan increases all over the world.",nocancer
"Metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma mimicking acinic cell carcinoma of the parotid gland: a case report. BACKGROUND: Fine needle aspiration (FNA) is becoming increasingly important in the diagnosis of salivary gland lesions. One of the diagnostic difficulties that arise from FNAs is the distinction between primary and metastatic tumors. We describe a case where a right cheek/parotid mass was originally diagnosed as acinic cell carcinoma (ACC) upon biopsy. Later, an FNA resampling of the mass was diagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and indeed, a subsequently performed computed tomography scan showed that the patient had a previously unknown liver mass. CASE: A 75-year-old man presented with a pathologic mandibular fracture. An initial needle core biopsy of the lesion showed neoplastic cells with abundant granular cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli and was diagnosed as ACC. The patient shortly thereafter developed an abdominal lesion that upon FNA was found to be cytologically similar to the parotid mass. Immunohistochemical stains showed that the abdominal mass was Hep Par 1 positive, and HCC was diagnosed. An FNA resampling of the parotid lesion was then performed, and stains showed that it was also Hep Par 1 positive. The lesion was rediagnosed as metastatic HCC and not ACC. Radiologic scans of the patient then showed a liver mass as well as multiple bony lesions. CONCLUSION: A right cheek/parotid mass initially diagnosed as ACC was later found to be metastatic HCC. At times, the judicious use of immunohistochemical stains is necessary to distinguish primary salivary gland neoplasias from metastatic tumors.",cancer
"Inhibition of Myc effectively targets KRAS mutation-positive lung cancer expressing high levels of Myc. Myc is an oncogenic transcription factor that promotes tumorigenesis. Recently, a dominant negative form of Myc (Omomyc) was shown to cause regression of lung tumors in a mouse model of lung cancer caused by KRAS mutation, suggesting that Myc might be a potential therapeutic target to treat the KRAS lung cancer. However, it is not yet known whether Omomyc can also inhibit the growth of human lung tumors that carry a similar KRAS mutation. In the present study, we demonstrate that Omomyc induces cell death of KRAS-mutated human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells in vitro and in vivo. However, Omomyc does not induce cell death in human lung adenocarcinoma H441 cells that also carry the KRAS mutation. Interestingly, A549 cells express high levels of Myc, while H441 cells do not. Co-expression of exogenous Myc with Omomyc in H441 cells induces cell death, indicating that Omomyc requires high levels of Myc to induce cell death in KRAS mutation-positive lung adenocarcinoma. Here, we show for the first time that KRAS mutation-positive lung cancer displaying high levels of Myc could be treated by inhibiting Myc transactivation function.",cancer
"Diagnosis of inadvertent cannulation of the azygos vein during cardiopulmonary bypass. Cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass demands diligence and attention to detail to prevent neurologic injury. Arterial and venous cannulae are used to facilitate cardiopulmonary bypass. The assessment of adequate decompression of the venous circulation is an essential duty of the cardiac surgical team. Modalities for the assessment of adequate regional venous drainage are limited, however communication between the team and increased awareness of certain pathologic states can be useful. These modalities include cerebral oximetry and superior vena caval pressure monitoring, which were employed during a case with bicaval venous cannulation. Malposition of the superior vena cava cannula was detected after a series of events alerted the team that superior vena cava drainage may be compromised.",nocancer

"How to assess renal function in the geriatric population. The progressive decline of renal function with aging is not inevitable, because it is mainly due to comorbid conditions such as hypertension and diabetes. However, in the elderly there is a high prevalence of chronic kidney disease leading to the need for strategies to control cardiovascular risk - death being far more common than dialysis at all stages of kidney function. Serum creatinine, the most widely used surrogate marker of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), is inaccurate with increasing age, particularly in sick and/or malnourished elderly people; it shows the so-called creatinine blind area, and substantial variation between laboratory analytical methods. An alternative endogenous marker is serum cystatin C: it correlates better with renal function and has the potential advantage of improved precision of the assay, but its measurement is still much more expensive. Current guidelines recommend that the 2 most commonly used equations to estimate GFR - the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study or Cockcroft-Gault equations - be used to estimate GFR in the clinical setting. Both show relevant bias, with underestimation of GFR in subjects with normal or mild renal impairment, a bias limited by using the more recent Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation. Nonetheless, keeping in mind that a decreased renal function in the elderly is not benign, current GFR equations facilitate detection, evaluation and management of the disease, and they should result in improved patient care and better clinical outcomes.",nocancer
"Granular cell myoblastoma of the tongue in a 2-year-old girl: a case report. Granular cell tumours are uncommon lesions, although the head and neck region accounts for approximately 50% of all lesions. It is not clear whether or not granular cell tumour is a true neoplasm, a developmental anomaly, or a trauma-induced proliferation. The basic cell of origin is now thought to be neural, although past reports frequently indicated an origin from striated muscle, or less frequently an origin from histiocytes, fibroblasts or pericytes. The tongue and the buccal mucosa are common intraoral sites. The other head and neck site likely to be involved is the larynx. The tumour generally occurs in middle or older aged adults. More than a third of all granular cell tumours occur on the lingual dorsum, usually as a sessile, painless, somewhat firm, immoveable nodule less than 1.5 cm in greatest diameter. Lesions often demonstrate a pallor or a yellowish discolouration and typically have a smooth surface. Histochemical and ultrastructural studies propose the origin of the lesion from Schwann cells, striated muscle, mesenchymal cells, histiocytes and epithelial cells. As most of the granular cell tumours are benign, surgical excision of the lesion is the treatment of choice.",cancer
"Nutritional modifiers of aging brain function: use of uridine and other phosphatide precursors to increase formation of brain synapses. Brain phosphatide synthesis requires three circulating compounds: docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), uridine, and choline. Oral administration of these phosphatide precursors to experimental animals increases the levels of phosphatides and synaptic proteins in the brain and per brain cell as well as the numbers of dendritic spines on hippocampal neurons. Arachidonic acid fails to reproduce these effects of DHA. If similar increases occur in human brain, administration of these compounds to patients with diseases that cause loss of brain synapses, such as Alzheimer's disease, could be beneficial.",nocancer
"Augmented kinematic feedback from haptic virtual reality for dental skill acquisition. We have developed a haptic virtual reality system for dental skill training. In this study we examined several kinds of kinematic information about the movement provided by the system supplement knowledge of results (KR) in dental skill acquisition. The kinematic variables examined involved force utilization (F) and mirror view (M). This created three experimental conditions that received augmented kinematic feedback (F, M, FM) and one control condition that did not (KR-only). Thirty-two dental students were randomly assigned to four groups. Their task was to perform access opening on the upper first molar with the haptic virtual reality system. An acquisition session consisted of two days of ten trials of practice in which augmented kinematic feedback was provided for the appropriate experimental conditions after each trial. One week after, a retention test consisting of two trials without augmented feedback was completed. The results showed that the augmented kinematic feedback groups had larger mean performance scores than the KR-only group in Day 1 of the acquisition and retention sessions (ANOVA, p<0.05). The apparent differences among feedback groups were not significant in Day 2 of the acquisition session (ANOVA, p>0.05). The trends in acquisition and retention sessions suggest that the augmented kinematic feedback can enhance the performance earlier in the skill acquisition and retention sessions.",nocancer
"Androgen receptor epigenetic variations influence early follicular phase gonadotropin levels. OBJECTIVE: we examined the influence of the androgen receptor gene (AR) CAG microsatellite (AR-CAG) repeat polymorphism and X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) pattern on ovarian reserve markers (follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and antral follicle count on menstrual cycle day 3-5) and disease etiology in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) or premature ovarian failure (POF). DESIGN: case-control study. Population. In all, 32 women with PCOS, 26 women with POF and 79 controls were investigated. METHODS: AR-CAG and XCI were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction-based assays following DNA digestion with the methylation-sensitive restrictase HpaII. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: distribution of AR-CAG alleles and XCI patterns. RESULTS: POF patients had shorter AR-CAG microsatellites than controls. AR-CAG microsatellite length was negatively associated with serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate level. The magnitude of XCI skewing was negatively and positively correlated with luteinizing hormone (LH) and FSH serum levels, respectively, during the early follicular phase, but showed no correlation with the number of early antral follicles. CONCLUSIONS: our results suggest that AR-CAG variations and XCI pattern exert an effect on FSH and LH values, and also have the potential to influence the etiopathogenesis of POF.",cancer
"Stem cell transplantation using non-myeloablative conditioning regimen with fludarabine for hematological malignancies. Stem cell transplantation (SCT) is a useful treatment for hematological malignancies, but it is limited to younger patients because of its high treatment-related mortality. Fludarabine (Flu), a novel anticancer agent with potent immunosuppressive activity, used as a conditioning regimen (reduced intensity transplantation; RIST), can decrease treatment-related mortality, as recently reported. However, the best drug combination and the best timing for RIST remain unknown. We herein report the SCT outcomes of 36 patients undergoing Flu treatment at our institution since December 2002 and retrospectively analyze the results. RIST conditioning with Flu was well-tolerated. No severe toxicity related conditioning regimens was observed in our patients, even though there were 10 patients with a history of autologous (n = 5) or allogeneic stem cell transplantation (n = 5). Hematological engraftment was found in 33 patients. The median times for reconstitution of WBCs, RBCs, and platelets were 16 days, 27.5 days and 34 days, respectively. Stable complete donor chimerism after SCT was present in all patients with WBC engraftment, and no patients experienced late rejection. Thirty-two patients were evaluated for acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD). Nine patients had no aGVHD. The incidence of grade I/II and III/IV aGVHD was 78% and 22%, respectively. Skin lesions were the major sites of involvement. Gut involvement was present in 9 patients. All 4 patients with grade IV GVHD had stage four hepatic GVHD. Twenty-two patients were analyzed for chronic GVHD (cGVHD). Twelve patients had no cGVHD, 6 had limited type and 4 had extended type. The overall survival (OS), relapse rate (RR), and non-relapse mortality (NRM) in all patients over 7 years were found to be 41.7%, 20.1%, and 34.6%, respectively. Induction failures were present in 5 cases of AML and 1 case of NHL. Disease progression was the primary cause of death, which occurred in 12 of 21 patients. Six patients died of grade IV GVHD (n = 2) or complicated fungal infection contracted during the GVHD treatment (n = 4). One patient died of secondary MSD, which originated from donor hematopoietic cells. Two patients died of cerebral bleeding and cardiac rapture, respectively. We found that the patients' state on SCT was the most important factor in long-term survival. The OS of standard risk and high risk patients with hematological malignancies were 75% and 30.3%. We concluded that stem cell transplantation using a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen with Flu was a useful therapeutic approach for patients with hematological malignancies.",cancer
"High prevalence of human anti-mouse antibodies in the serum of colorectal cancer patients. BACKGROUND: Monoclonal antibody treatment induces the expression of human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA), which in turn interfere with the therapy. However, whether HAMAs are expressed before the initiation of antibody therapy in patients with colorectal cancer remains unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum samples were collected from 40 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Serum samples from 157 individuals without cancer were used as controls. None of the patients received imaging or therapeutic antibodies before the study. The expression of HAMAs was evaluated by ELISA with murine immunoglobulin G1 (mIgG)1, mIgG2a and mIgG2b as the antigen. RESULTS: Of the 40 colorectal cancer patients, 9 (22.5%) expressed either IgG- or IgM-type HAMAs while only 13/157 (8.2%) of the individuals without cancer expressed the HAMAs (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: HAMAs are prevalent in the serum of colorectal cancer patients even before antibody administration. Medical practitioners should be alert to the possibility of HAMA expression when administering antibody therapy.",cancer

"Diagnosis and management of biliary cystic malformations in neonates. PURPOSE: Recent advances in ultrasonography have made it possible to identify biliary atresia (BA) and choledochal cyst (CC) with biliary cystic malformations (BCM) both prenatally and neonatally. The early differential diagnosis between BA and CC is extremely important because operations must be performed as soon as possible before the livers of BA patients advance to an irreversible cirrhotic stage. The aim of this study was to differentiate patients with BCM and to determine the best course of management in the neonatal period. METHODS: The medical records of patients that were diagnosed with BCM by a prenatal or neonatal ultrasound between 1997 and 2008 were reviewed. We retrospectively divided the BCM patients into the BA and CC groups and then compared the results of ultrasound, computed tomography, and laboratory tests between the 2 groups. RESULTS: Ten patients were enrolled in the study. The median age at the time of corrective surgery was 74 days (range, 24-206 days). All of the BA cases received an operation by the time they were 60 days old. In the BA group (5 patients), the mean cyst size was 15 mm, the mean direct bilirubin (D-Bil) was 3.3 mg/dL, and the mean total bile acid (TBA) was 138.1 micromol/L at 30 days of age, whereas in the CC group (5 patients), cyst size, D-Bil, and TBA were 40 mm, 0.9 mg/dL, and 46.9 micromol/L, respectively. These differences between the 2 groups were statistically significant. All of the patients with CC successfully cleared their jaundice, whereas 4 patients with BA subsequently required liver transplantation for liver failure. In our study, all patients with BCM less than 21 mm, D-Bil greater than 2.5 mg/dL, and TBA greater than 111 micromol/L in the neonatal period were diagnosed with BA. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggested that patients with BCM smaller than 21 mm, D-Bil higher than 2.5 mg/dL, and TBA higher than 111 micromol/L in the neonatal period were more likely to have BA than CC. This potential diagnosis should be surgically examined and corrected as soon as possible.",cancer
"Acute appendicitis as primary symptom of prostatic adenocarcinoma: report of a case. The most common disease ofappendix is acute appendicitis. There have been at least 20 case reports of metastasis-induced appendicitis in English literature.

Confirmation was done based on serum PSA study, transrectal ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy, and review of the material from Hua Hin Hospital. Orchidectomy was performed with satisfactory outcome. The patient was doing well for two years before upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage and obstructive jaundice caused by another aggressive tumor developed. He died of the second tumor associated with subsequent renal failure in spite of good response to orchidectomy.",cancer
"Management structures and beliefs in a professional organisation. an example from Swedish Public Dental Health Services. Work as a dentist is stressful and demanding. In the Public Dental Health Service (PDHS) the heads of clinics' have a great influence on the work environment. In turn the heads have to adapt to the overarching policies on management in each County, which create the environment for the clinics. The aims of this paper were to describe the management structure of the PDHS as described by their Chief Dental Officers (CDOs), and to test hypotheses that the management systems had ""a logical administrative structure"". A postal questionnaire was mailed to all 21 CDOs,who all responded. Context analysis and bivariate correlations were used. The PDHS employed on average 60% of all dentists in a county. The numbers of clinics for general dentistry in Sweden was 698, and for specialist care 144. The heads of clinics were dentists in 92%. Four hypotheses were tested. 1. separate political board did not lead to closer governance of the PDHS. 2. There was more emphasis on measurable than on qualitative objectives and followup. 3. There was only partial correlation between a larger county and a more formalized management. 4. There was no correlation between size of county and beliefs on advantages of scale. There was a widespread belief in advantages with larger clinics both from administrative, and rather surprisingly, from clinical aspects. Two of the four hypotheses could not be corroborated which indicates that the management structures were more formed by county specific principles. The four hypotheses on administrative behaviour were only partially corroborated. The implications for delivery of care to sparsely populated areas need to be monitored in view of the beliefs in larger clinics. The limits for decisions by management and for professional discretion must be monitored closely considering their effects on work environment and on the quality of care the professionals are able to deliver.",nocancer
"Diagnostic dilemmas of infantile sarcoma of the forearm. The authors present an interesting case of a suckling baby treated for forearm tumour. All the preoperative examinations including the imaging methods are documented, as are the surgical procedures and the final results. The case report is interesting not only because such surgery is infrequent but also due to the unpredictable progress of the final diagnosis statement. Before surgery the tumour was diagnosed as an organising haematoma; based on clinical and radiological signs the diagnosis subsequently rose to rapidly growing haemangioma or vascular malformation causing arm paresis and vascular supply disorder. The diagnosis was changed to angiolipoma during surgery. The final histopathological statement was: infantile fibrosarcoma. Despite the virtue of imaging methods and meticulous clinical examination, the surgical and histopathological findings are not necessarily absolutely identical. Having presented this particular case the authors would like to share their experience.",cancer

"The use of osteo-articular allografts for reconstruction after resection of the distal radius for tumour. Several techniques have been described to reconstruct a mobile wrist joint after resection of the distal radius for tumour. We reviewed our experience of using an osteo-articular allograft to do this in 17 patients with a mean follow-up of 58.9 months (28 to 119). The mean range of movement at the wrist was 56 degrees flexion, 58 degrees extension, 84 degrees supination and 80 degrees pronation. The mean ISOLS-MSTS score was 86% (63% to 97%) and the mean patient-rated wrist evaluation score was 16.5 (3 to 34). There was no local recurrence or distant metastases. The procedure failed in one patient with a fracture of the graft and an arthrodesis was finally required. Union was achieved at the host-graft interface in all except two cases. No patient reported more than modest non-disabling pain and six reported no pain at all. Radiographs showed early degenerative changes at the radiocarpal joint in every patient. A functional pain-free wrist can be restored with an osteo-articular allograft after resection of the distal radius for bone tumour, thereby avoiding the donor site morbidity associated with an autograft. These results may deteriorate with time.",cancer

"The Harris hip score: Do ceiling effects limit its usefulness in orthopedics? BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Harris hip score (HHS), a disease-specific health status scale that is frequently used to measure the outcome of total hip arthroplasty, has never been validated properly. A questionnaire is suitable only when all 5 psychometric properties are of sufficient quality. We questioned the usefulness of the HHS by investigating its content validity. METHODS: We performed a systematic review based on a literature search in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for descriptive studies published in 2007. 54 studies (59 patient groups) met our criteria and were included in the data analysis. To determine the content validity, we calculated the ceiling effect (percentage) for each separate study and we pooled data to measure the weighted mean. A subanalysis of indications for THA was performed to differentiate the populations for which the HHS would be suitable and for which it would not. A ceiling effect of 15% or less was considered to be acceptable. RESULTS: Over half the studies (31/59) revealed unacceptable ceiling effects. Pooled data across the studies included (n = 6,667 patients) suggested ceiling effects of 20% (95%CI: 18-22). Ceiling effects were greater (32%, 95%CI:12-52) in those patients undergoing hip resurfacing arthroplasty. INTERPRETATION: Although the Harris hip score is widely used in arthroplasty research on outcomes, ceiling effects are common and these severely limit its validity in this field of research.",nocancer
"Systemic approaches for multifocal bronchioloalveolar carcinoma: is there an appropriate target? Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC) is a subset of pulmonary adenocarcinoma characterized by distinct and unique pathological, molecular, radiographic, and clinical features. While the incidence of pure BAC is rare, comprising only 1% to 4% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), mixed subtypes (including BAC with focal invasion and adenocarcinoma with BAC features) represent as much as 20% of adenocarcinomas--and that figure may be increasing. Despite the longstanding recognition of this entity, there is no established treatment paradigm for patients with multifocal BAC, resulting in competing approaches and treatment controversies. Current options for multifocal BAC include both surgery and systemic therapies. Unfortunately, prospective data on systemic approaches are limited by study design and small patient numbers; there are only seven phase II studies involving four therapies. This article evaluates key characteristics of BAC, including the current understanding of histopathology and tumor biology. In addition, it comprehensively reviews the systemic phase II studies in an attempt to clarify the therapeutic challenges in this disease. It also includes the first proposed treatment paradigm that integrates both EGFR mutational status and the sub-histologies, mucinous and nonmucinous BAC.",cancer
"Risk factors for pulmonary tuberculosis among health-care workers in Ibadan, Nigeria. Data on TB infection control programs is limited in many of the TB high burden countries. We carried out a one-year cross sectional epidemiological study (January-December, 2008) to determine the prevalence of occupationally-acquired pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) among Health- Care Workers (HCWs) in Ibadan, Nigeria. This information is important for planning preventive strategies. All consenting HCWs at two TB centres in Ibadan--the University College Hospital (UCH) and Jericho Chest Hospital were enrolled into the study. A well structured questionnaire was used to obtain information on socio-demographic characteristics of the subjects including their medical and social data. Three sputum samples collected from each subject were processed for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) and culture on selective medium. Isolates were confirmed as M. tuberculosis by standard biochemical tests. Of the 271 subjects recruited, nine (3.3%) had their sputum positive for AFB while six (2.2%) were positive for culture. Subjects aged 20 years and above, female gender and unskilled professionals had higher risk for occupationally-acquired PTB than those who were 20 years and below, male gender and skilled professionals (Odd Ratio OR = 1.9, 95% Confidence Interval, 95% CI = 0.23-16.3, Fisher's exact P = 0.37; OR = 1.1, 95% CI = 0.28-4.0, p = 0.01; OR = 1.05, 95% CI = 1.02-1.08, p = 3.43) respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that subjects who received BCG vaccination were less likely to have occupationally-acquired PTB than those without vaccination (OR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.20-3.6, p = 0.83 for microscopy; OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.13- 0.44, p = 0.76 for culture). Even though the risk for occupationally-acquired PTB was lower in subjects who had not spent up to two years in their units, the association was not statistically significant (OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.20-3.5, p = 0.82 for microscopy and OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 0.22-0.65, p = 0.82 for culture).

"Perineurioma of the sciatic nerve: a possible cause of idiopathic foot drop in children: report of 4 cases. The authors report on a loss of foot dorsiflexion in pediatric-age individuals and suggest that the possible cause could be a perineurioma of the sciatic nerve. The authors describe 4 cases in which foot drop in the absence of sensory discomfort was the heralding sign of perineurioma of the sciatic nerve. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a focal enlargement of the sciatic nerve, but the tumor was confined only to its lateral compartment. Treatment in 2 cases involved excision of the affected segment and subsequent graft repair. The two other patients shared the same clinical, radiological, and surgical findings, but no nerve biopsy sample was obtained; the patients underwent only a tibialis posterior muscle transfer. Long-term recovery of nerve function never occurred. Because tumor resection and nerve graft yield no functional results, a tendon transfer to restore walking may be the sole useful surgical procedure in these cases. Removal of the tumor may not be necessary because long-term follow-up confirms that perineuriomas are self-limiting and the final prognosis is favorable.",cancer
"Performance improvement in addiction treatment: efforts in California. This article examines performance data improvement efforts among alcohol and other drug (AOD) county and program stakeholders within California's publicly-funded treatment system. County AOD system administrators from approximately two-thirds of California counties (N=37) and a random sample of treatment program managers (N=63) were surveyed about practices and priorities related to using performance data to improve service delivery. Survey results showed that over half (56.8%) of the county administrators reported using performance and/or outcome measures to guide decision-making about the treatment programs with which they contract. Measures of treatment engagement and retention were most frequently reported as high priorities for performance data collection. Treatment providers reported considerable variation with their use of performance measures to improve practices. Overall, findings from this study suggest that many programs and counties are taking steps toward adopting practices of performance measurement and management for treatment improvement, although they still require assistance and support in establishing, collecting, and using performance data.",nocancer

"Sleep, ageing and stroke--newer directions in management of stroke. Stroke is a serious health problem and is chiefly a disorder of the elderly population. Several modifiable and non modifiable risk factors have been studied. The association of sleep disorders and stroke is exciting. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) which is now considered a systemic disease significantly increases the risk of stroke and death from any cause and the increase is independent of other risk factors including hypertension. There is high prevalence of OSA in the elderly. OSA affects the cerebral hemodynamics adversely. There appears to be a bi-directional relation between sleep disordered breathing(SDB) and cerebrovascular accidents. Strokes can themselves generate SDB. The presence of OSA in stroke patients is associated with poor outcome. Cyclical hypoxia and sympathetic stimulation has deleterious effects on cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and metabolic functions. The effects are particularly important in existing ischemic brain injury. Use of continuous positive pressure in OSA patients is rewarding. We propose that feeding through Ryle's tube may compromise with the patency of pharynx during sleep times and therefore this must be considered in management guidelines for stroke.",nocancer
"Renal ultrasonography in the evaluation of acute kidney injury: developing a risk stratification framework. BACKGROUND: In adult inpatients with acute kidney injury (AKI), clinicians routinely order a renal ultrasonography (RUS) study. It is unclear how often this test provides clinically useful information. METHODS: Cross-sectional study, including derivation and validation samples, of 997 US adults admitted to Yale-New Haven Hospital from January 2005 to May 2009, who were diagnosed as having AKI and who underwent RUS to evaluate elevated creatinine level. Pregnant women, renal transplant recipients, and patients with recently diagnosed hydronephrosis (HN) were excluded. Demographic and clinical characteristics were abstracted from the medical records. A multivariable logistic regression model was developed to create risk strata for HN and HN requiring an intervention (HNRI); a separate sample was used for validation. The frequency of incidental findings on RUS was assessed for each stratum. RESULTS: In a derivation sample of 200 patients, 7 factors were found to be associated with HN: history of HN; recurrent urinary tract infections; diagnosis consistent with obstruction; nonblack race; and absence of the following: exposure to nephrotoxic medications, congestive heart failure, or prerenal AKI. Among 797 patients in the validation sample (mean age, 65.6 years), 10.6% had HN and 3.3% had HNRI. Of 223 patients in the low-risk group, 7 (3.1%) had HN and 1 (0.4%) had HNRI (223 patients needed to be screened to find 1 case of HNRI). In this group, there were 0 incidental findings on RUS unknown to the clinical team. In the higher-risk group, 15.7% had HN and 4.7% had HNRI. CONCLUSION: In adult inpatients with AKI, specific factors can identify patients unlikely to have HN or HNRI on RUS.",nocancer

"Hearing and sound source identification with protective headwear. This study investigated the effect on hearing, sound attenuation, and sound source identification of a prototype neck and two prototype mandible guards attached to a combat helmet. Ten male subjects participated. Free-field hearing thresholds were measured from 250 Hz to 8,000 Hz with the head bare and fitted with the helmet alone and with the guards. Sound source identification was assessed using a horizontal array of eight loudspeakers surrounding the subject. The stimulus was a 75-dB SPL, 300-ms noise burst. Neither the helmet worn alone or with the guards affected hearing or provided significant sound attenuation. The helmet combinations resulted in a significant decrease in sound source identification, of 11.6%. This was due to diminished accuracy for loudspeakers close to the interaural axis of the head. The neck guard induced a frontal bias for these positions. This error pattern is not likely to interfere with localization during combat.",nocancer
"Aortic root aneurysm: principles of repair and long-term follow-up. OBJECTIVES: This study was undertaken to examine clinical and echocardiographic outcomes of aortic valve-sparing operations to treat aortic root aneurysms. METHODS: From May 1988 to December 2007, a total of 228 patients underwent reimplantation of the aortic valve, and 61 underwent remodeling of the aortic root. Patients were followed up prospectively and had echocardiographic evaluation of valve function. Mean follow-up was 7.28 +/- 4.33 years. RESULTS: There were 5 operative and 26 late deaths. Survival at 12 years was 82.9 +/- 3.7% and similar between types of operations. Age and aortic dissection were independent predictors of mortality. Seven patients have had reoperations on the aortic valve: 6 for aortic insufficiency and 1 for endocarditis. Five of these patients had undergone remodeling of the aortic root. Freedoms from reoperation at 12 years were 94.3% +/- 2.6% among all patients, 90.4% +/- 4.7% after remodeling, and 97.4% +/- 2.2% after reimplantation (P = .09). Postoperatively, moderate aortic insufficiency developed in 14 patients (8 remodeling and 6 reimplantation) and severe aortic insufficiency in 5 (3 remodeling and 2 reimplantation). The remaining patients had mild, trace, or no aortic insufficiency. Freedoms from moderate or severe aortic insufficiency at 12 years were 86.8% +/- 3.8% among all patients, 82.6% +/- 6.2% after remodeling, and 91.0% +/- 3.8% after reimplantation (P = .035). Only age-by 5-year increments-was an independent predictor of postoperative aortic insufficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Aortic valve-sparing operations provide excellent patient survival and stable aortic valve function, particularly after reimplantation of the aortic valve.",nocancer
"A short account of cancer--specifically in relation to squamous cell carcinoma. Cancer is the outcome of a complex multifactorial process of cytogenetic and epigenetic changes that affect cell cycle progression, apoptosis, DNA repair mechanisms and cell differentiation. Cancer cells have the capacity to evade the immune system, to invade tissues and to metastasize. Cancer is treated by surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, each as single treatment modalities or more often in combination. Failure of treatment to cure a patient of cancer may be owing to the fact that radiotherapy and chemotherapy can eradicate transit-amplifying cells which are characterized by uncontrolled proliferation and prolonged survival; but cannot eradicate all cancer stem cells that divide slowly, have a relatively unlimited self-renewal capacity and express anti-apoptotic genes; and also owing to the fact that surgery cannot always eliminate occult fields of pre-cancerization.",cancer
"A comparison of the anticipated benefits and received outcomes of pediatric cochlear implantation: parental perspectives. Findings of a study that investigated parents' expectations and experiences of their children's outcomes with cochlear implants are presented. A survey completed by 247 parents whose children had received implants in eastern Australia compared parents' reports of their preimplant expectations with their experiences of postimplant outcomes on several items related to communication, academic, and psychosocial domains. Quantitative findings derived from the survey data were extended and elaborated on by qualitative findings from interviews with 27 of the parents. The findings indicated that parents' relatively high expectations of their children's outcomes largely had been met, although a tenth of survey respondents reported that their expectations had not been met. It appeared that professionals generally provided parents with realistic expectations. The qualitative findings revealed a complex interaction among parents' expectations, hopes, and determination that their children would do well with the implant.

"Incidence, survival, and prevalence of neuroendocrine tumors versus neuroblastoma in children and young adults: nine standard SEER registries, 1975-2006. BACKGROUND: The incidence, survival, and prevalence of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) in children were determined as a first step in improving diagnosis and therapy. Outcomes were compared with neuroblastoma, a pediatric malignancy that shares several biomarkers. METHODS: Incidence rates, observed survival rates and 31-year limited duration prevalence counts were obtained from SEER*Stat for diagnosis years 1975 to 2006. These rates were compared between and within NETs and neuroblastoma for demographic and tumor-related variables from nine standard SEER registries for ages 0-29 years. Multivariate Cox regression was performed to identify prognostic factors for survival in NETs. RESULTS: The number of NETs was 1,073 compared to 1,664 neuroblastomas. The most common NET sites were lung, breast, and appendix. NET 5-year observed survival rates increased from 83% between 1975 and 1979 to 84% for the 2000-2006 period, while analogous neuroblastoma survival rates steadily increased from 45-73%. Five-year observed survival was less than 30% in females with NETs of the cervix and ovary. The estimated 31-year limited duration prevalence for NETs as of January 1, 2006 in the U.S. population was 7,724 compared to 9,960 for neuroblastomas. Age-adjusted multivariate Cox Regression demonstrated small cell histology, primary location in the breast, and distant stage as major predictors of decreased survival. CONCLUSIONS: While survivorship has significantly increased for neuroblastoma, those diagnosed with NETs have shown no increase in survival during this 31-year period. NETs constitute an unrecognized cancer threat to children and young adults comparable to neuroblastoma in both number of affected persons and disease severity.",cancer
"Effect of mitoxantrone on outcome of children with first relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL R3): an open-label randomised trial. BACKGROUND: Although survival of children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia has improved greatly in the past two decades, the outcome of those who relapse has remained static. We investigated the outcome of children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia who relapsed on present therapeutic regimens. METHODS: This open-label randomised trial was undertaken in 22 centres in the UK and Ireland and nine in Australia and New Zealand. Patients aged 1-18 years with first relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia were stratified into high-risk, intermediate-risk, and standard-risk groups on the basis of duration of first complete remission, site of relapse, and immunophenotype. All patients were allocated to receive either idarubicin or mitoxantrone in induction by stratified concealed randomisation. Neither patients nor those giving interventions were masked. After three blocks of therapy, all high-risk group patients and those from the intermediate group with postinduction high minimal residual disease (>/=10(-4) cells) received an allogenic stem-cell transplant. Standard-risk and intermediate-risk patients with postinduction low minimal residual disease (<10(-4) cells) continued chemotherapy. The primary outcome was progression-free survival and the method of analysis was intention-to-treat. Randomisation was stopped in December, 2007 because of differences in progression-free and overall survival between the two groups. This trial is registered, reference number ISCRTN45724312. FINDINGS: Of 239 registered patients, 216 were randomly assigned to either idarubicin (109 analysed) or mitoxantrone (103 analysed). Estimated 3-year progression-free survival was 35.9% (95% CI 25.9-45.9) in the idarubicin group versus 64.6% (54.2-73.2) in the mitoxantrone group (p=0.0004), and 3-year overall survival was 45.2% (34.5-55.3) versus 69.0% (58.5-77.3; p=0.004). Differences in progression-free survival between groups were mainly related to a decrease in disease events (progression, second relapse, disease-related deaths; HR 0.56, 0.34-0.92, p=0.007) rather than an increase in adverse treatment effects (treatment death, second malignancy; HR 0.52, 0.24-1.11, p=0.11). INTERPRETATION: As compared with idarubicin, mitoxantrone conferred a significant benefit in progression-free and overall survival in children with relapsed acute lymphobastic leukaemia, a potentially useful clinical finding that warrants further investigation.

"Malonylcarnitine in newborns with non-syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate. AIM: Malonyl-CoA is regarded as a key signaling molecule in mammalian cells. It is converted to acetyl-CoA, and to a lesser extent, to malonyl acid and malonylcarnitine (C3DC). Availability of carnitine has been reported to be essential for the developing fetus. The objectives of the present study were to analyze associations of malonylcarnitine, acetylcarnitine (C2), and free carnitine (CO) in subjects with orofacial clefts. METHODOLOGY: We performed a retrospective analysis of carnitine concentration obtained from a newborn screening program carried out in our institution. Concentrations of whole blood malonylcarnitine, acetylcarnitine, and free carnitine were measured using tandem mass spectrometry. The study group consisted of 51 children with nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate. In total, 106 healthy children without congenital anomalies served as controls. Cut-off points were established using likelihood ratio values. RESULTS: The mean concentration of malonylcarnitine in the cleft group was lower than that of the control group, 0.048 micromol x L(-1) vs. 0.058 micromol x L(-1), respectively (P = 0.009). In patients with orofacial cleft, low malonylcarnitine levels (< or = 0.047 micromol x L(-1)) were 1.7 times more predominant than in healthy individuals (P = -0.03). The mean concentration of acetylcarnitine was also lower in affected newborns in comparison to controls, 33.8 micromol x L(-1) vs. 37.8 micromol x L(-1), respectively (P = 0.026). After analysis of acetylcarnitine and free carnitine concentrations, the likelihood ratio test did not indicate valuable cut-offpoints. CONCLUSION: The study provides initial data indicating a potential association between decreased malonylcarnitine and abnormal palatogenesis.",nocancer

"Platelets: linking hemostasis and cancer. Platelets are the main cellular component in blood responsible for maintaining the integrity of the cardiovascular system via hemostasis. Platelet dysfunction contributes to a wide range of obvious pathological conditions, such as bleeding or thrombosis, but normal platelet function is also linked to diseases not immediately associated with hemostasis or thrombosis, such as cancer. Since the description of Trousseau syndrome in 1865, various experimental and clinical studies have detailed the interaction of platelets with primary tumors and circulating metastatic tumor cells. Observations have suggested that platelets not only augment the growth of primary tumors via angiogenesis but endow tumor cells physical and mechanical support to evade the immune system and extravasate to secondary organs, the basis of metastatic disease. Many laboratory and animal studies have identified specific targets for antiplatelet therapy that may be advantageous as adjuncts to existing cancer treatments. In this review, we summarize important platelet properties that influence tumorigenesis, including primary tumor growth and metastasis at the molecular level. The studies provide a link between the well-studied paradigms of platelet hemostasis and tumorigenesis.",cancer

OBJECTIVES: (i) To determine whether prophylactic mastectomy reduces death rates from any cause in women who have never had breast cancer and in women who have a history of breast cancer in one breast, and (ii) to examine the effect of prophylactic mastectomy on other endpoints, including breast cancer incidence, breast cancer mortality, disease-free survival, physical morbidity, and psychosocial outcomes. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2002), MEDLINE and Cancerlit (1966 to June 2006), EMBASE (1974 to June 2006), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) search portal (until June 2006). Studies in English were included. SELECTION CRITERIA: Participants included women at risk for breast cancer in at least one breast. Interventions included all types of mastectomy performed for the purpose of preventing breast cancer. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two authors independently abstracted data. Data were summarized descriptively; quantitative meta-analysis was not feasible due to heterogeneity of study designs and insufficient reporting. Data were analyzed separately for bilateral prophylactic mastectomy (BPM) and contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM). MAIN RESULTS: All 39 included studies were observational studies with some methodological limitations; randomized trials were absent. The studies presented data on 7,384 women with a wide range of risk factors for breast cancer who underwent PM.BPM studies on the incidence of breast cancer and/or disease-specific mortality reported reductions after BPM particularly for those with BRCA1/2 mutations. For CPM, studies consistently reported reductions in incidence of contralateral breast cancer but were inconsistent about improvements in disease-specific survival. Only one study attempted to control for multiple differences between intervention groups and this study showed no overall survival advantage for CPM at 15 years. Another study showed significantly improved survival following CPM but after adjusting for bilateral prophylactic oophorectomy, the CPM effect on all-cause mortality was no longer significant.Sixteen studies assessed psychosocial measures; most reported high levels of satisfaction with the decision to have PM but more variable satisfaction with cosmetic results. Worry over breast cancer was significantly reduced after BPM when compared both to baseline worry levels and to the groups who opted for surveillance rather than BPM.Case series reporting on adverse events from PM with or without reconstruction reported rates of unanticipated re-operations from 4% in those without reconstruction to 49% in patients with reconstruction. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Sixteen studies have been published since the last version of the review, without altering our conclusions. While published observational studies demonstrated that BPM was effective in reducing both the incidence of, and death from, breast cancer, more rigorous prospective studies (ideally randomized trials) are needed. BPM should be considered only among those at very high risk of disease. There is insufficient evidence that CPM improves survival and studies that control for multiple confounding variables are needed.",cancer
"Curcumin-altered p53-response genes regulate radiosensitivity in p53-mutant Ewing's sarcoma cells. AIM: Curcumin has been demonstrated to have antitumor effects including radiosensitization by modulating many molecular targets including p53. Herein, we investigated the radiosensitizing effect of curcumin in p53 mutant Ewing's sarcoma (ES) cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cells exposed to radiation with or without curcumin were examined for transcriptional and translational levels of p53 downstream targets and its influence in regulated apoptosis, DNA fragmentation, cell survival and clonal expansion. RESULTS: Curcumin significantly caused radiation induced expression of p21 and Bax, and reduced BclXl, Mcl1 with only marginal Bcl2 modulation. As a positive control to the study, both transcriptional and translational levels of p53 remained unchanged after radiation with/without curcumin. Conversely, curcumin caused radiation-induced apoptosis and DNA fragmentation. Consistently, curcumin enhanced radiation-induced cytotoxicity and clonal expansion. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that curcumin potentially radiosensitizes p53-mutant ES cells by regulating IR-modulated p53-response genes. However, the curcumin-associated p53-independent regulation of downstream targets remains to be explored.",cancer
Huge endometriosis presenting like an ovarian tumor: CT appearance. A 32-year-old female with a clinical history of abdominal swelling underwent CT of the abdomen. A huge biloculated cystic mass with a mural nodule in the abdominal and pelvic region was seen. The lesion showed slightly homogeneous enhancement. The imaging findings suggested an ovarian tumor. Histopathological evaluation after surgical resection revealed that the lesion was a bilateral ovarian endometriosis.,cancer
"Branched endografts for thoracoabdominal aneurysms. PURPOSE: Endovascular management of thoracoabdominal aneurysms has been studied since 2001, with marked advances allowing for the treatment of complex anatomic situations including chronic aortic dissections, tortuous anatomy, and extensive aneurysms that involve the visceral segment, aortic arch, and iliacs as well. However, the technology is not widely disseminated, and a thorough understanding of the engineering principles, imaging techniques, and devices available is required. METHODS: Reinforced fenestrated branches coupled with balloon expandable stent grafts, and side-arm branch designs mated with self-expanding stent grafts have been used. Pure fenestrated designs were used for juxtarenal aneurysms, whereas thoracoabdominal aneurysms were treated with reinforced fenestrated branches or hybrid devices including side-arm branches and reinforced fenestrated branches. Intraoperative fusion techniques have been used since 2009, whereby preoperative computed tomographic data are fused with intraoperative fluoroscopy. Long-term survival in accordance with extent of disease was assessed with life table analysis techniques, and differences were analyzed using the log rank test. Intermediate-term data pertaining to patency related to both types of branches and paraplegia have been evaluated and previously published. RESULTS: A total of 406 patients with thoracoabdominal aneurysms and 227 patients with juxtarenal aneurysms have been enrolled in a prospective study. Perioperative and 2-year survival were most closely related to extent of initial disease and were estimated to be 1.8% and 82% for juxtarenal aneurysms, 2.3% and 82% for type IV, and 5.2% and 74% for type II and III thoracoabdominal aneurysms at 24 months, respectively. When patients undergoing endovascular repair (ER group) were matched with those having contemporary surgical repair (SR group) for anatomic disease extent, mortality was similar at 30 days (5.7% ER vs 8.3% SR; P = .2) and at 12 months (15.6% ER vs 15.9% SR; P = .9). Paraplegia risk was also similar between the 2 groups (4.3% ER vs 7.5% SR, respectively; P = .08). Among the 633 patients, there were 5 (0.8%) late ruptures at a mean of 18 months after treatment, of which 4 were fatal. They were attributed to component separation (n = 3), a remote aneurysm rupture proximal to the endovascular repair, and a failed surgical polyester graft distal to the repair. Reinforced fenestrated branch patency, when coupled with balloon-expandable stent grafts, was 97.8% at a mean follow-up of 15 months. Side-arm branch occlusion occurred in only 1 case, within 24 hours of the procedure. New imaging tools resulted in a marked reduction in the average contrast dose (>50%). CONCLUSIONS: Intermediate-term results with multiple methods of endovascular repair of thoracoabdominal aneurysm indicate the technical feasibility of the procedure and show great promise in patients considered at high risk for open surgery. The intermediate-term patency and survival are excellent, and ruptures are exceedingly uncommon. However, mortality and spinal cord ischemia risks are still considerable with this technique.",nocancer
"Mohs surgery is effective for high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. BACKGROUND: Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) is effective in the treatment of invasive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). High-risk SCC has a more guarded prognosis. OBJECTIVES: To report the outcome of patients with high-risk SCCs treated with MMS. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two hundred fifteen patients with 260 high-risk cutaneous SCCs were reviewed in a single-center retrospective study, considering rates of recurrence, metastasis, and death. Cases were analyzed according to sex, age, immunocompetency status, tumor depth, lesion site, perineural disease, death rate, cause of death, secondary SCC, and melanoma. Seventy-seven percent of patients were male; 23% were female. Average age was 70.6. Twenty percent of patients were immunosuppressed. Mean follow-up was 3.9 years. RESULTS: There were three local recurrences (1.2%). Twelve (4.6%) tumors involved named nerve trunks. In eight of these cases, adjuvant radiation therapy was employed. Six (2.3%) tumors metastasized, with one fatality from disease. Seventy-five percent of patients developed another cutaneous SCC, and 7.7% developed a subsequent malignant melanoma. CONCLUSIONS: MMS is an effective treatment for high-risk cutaneous SCC. This represents the largest single-center study of high-risk SCC supporting the use of MMS. Adjuvant radiotherapy was reserved for large-nerve perineural disease. There was a low recurrence rate and disease-specific mortality. Prompt recognition of metastatic disease allowed for curative therapy. Patients with one high-risk SCC are likely to develop secondary primary SCC and melanoma.",cancer
"A critique of revision rate as an outcome measure: re-interpretation of knee joint registry data. National registers compare implants by their revision rates, but the validity of the method has never been assessed. The New Zealand Joint Registry publishes clinical outcomes (Oxford knee scores, OKS) alongside revision rates, allowing comparison of the two measurements. In the two types of knee replacement, unicompartmental (UKR) had a better knee score than total replacement (TKR), but the revision rate of the former was nearly three times higher than that of the latter. This was because the sensitivity of the revision rate to clinical failure was different for the two implants. For example, of knees with a very poor outcome (OKS < 20 points), only about 12% of TKRs were revised compared with about 63% of UKRs with similar scores. Revision therefore is not an objective measurement and should not be used to compare these two types of implant. Furthermore, revision is much less sensitive than the OKS to clinical failure in both types and therefore exaggerates the success of knee replacements, particularly of TKR.",nocancer
"Treatment of tracheal and bronchial tumors and tracheal and bronchial stent placement. Tumors of and trauma to the trachea and bronchi can result in loss of integrity of the airway and death. Once treated primarily with thoracic surgery, these conditions are increasingly being managed with interventional pulmonary procedures outside the operating room but requiring the assistance of anesthetists. These interventional procedures require airway instrumentation, necessitating anesthesia care for ventilation and obtundation of airway reflexes. A thorough preoperative assessment and consultation with the pulmonologist or surgeon performing the procedure are essential for successful completion of the tumor and scar reduction and subsequent stent placement. In addition, anesthetists may care for patients undergoing nonpulmonary surgery who have an existing bronchial or tracheal stent or patients requiring correction of displaced stents. A discussion on the preferred methods for caring for patients in these situations is included.",cancer
"Retrieval of associative information congruent with prior knowledge is related to increased medial prefrontal activity and connectivity. We remember information that is congruent instead of incongruent with prior knowledge better, but the underlying neural mechanisms related to this enhancement are still relatively unknown. Recently, this memory enhancement due to a prior schema has been suggested to be based on rapid neocortical assimilation of new information, related to optimized encoding and consolidation processes. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is thought to be important in mediating this process, but its role in retrieval of schema-consistent information is still unclear. In this study, we regarded multisensory congruency with prior knowledge as a schema and used this factor to probe retrieval of consolidated memories either consistent or inconsistent with prior knowledge. We conducted a visuotactile learning paradigm in which participants studied visual motifs randomly associated with word-fabric combinations that were either congruent or incongruent with common knowledge. The next day, participants were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging while their memory was tested. Congruent associations were remembered better than incongruent ones. This behavioral finding was parallelized by stronger retrieval-related activity in and connectivity between medial prefrontal and left somatosensory cortex. Moreover, we found a positive across-subject correlation between the connectivity enhancement and the behavioral congruency effect. These results show that successful retrieval of congruent compared to incongruent visuotactile associations is related to enhanced processing in an mPFC-somatosensory network, and support the hypothesis that new information that fits a preexisting schema is more rapidly assimilated in neocortical networks, a process that may be mediated, at least in part, by the mPFC.",nocancer
"Preliminary proposal for surgical classification of sacral tumors. OBJECT: The authors propose a new surgical classification method for sacral tumors that improves the guidance for specific surgical decisions and approaches. METHODS: The authors retrospectively studied the clinical courses of 92 patients with sacral tumors treated at the Changhai Hospital; all patients underwent tumor resection between January 2000 and August 2005. The clinical characteristics, imaging features, and pathological classifications were carefully assessed in each case. The tumors were classified according to the imaging features and intraoperative findings. The surgical approach and the resection area were determined according to the tumor classification. RESULTS: The proposed surgical classification system divided the sacral tumors into 2 major types according to the lesion's anatomical position in the sagittal plane. The tumors were further divided into 4 subtypes according to the length of the tumor's anterior protrusion into the pelvic cavity. Finally, each tumor subtype was classified into 16 areas according to the anatomical position in the cross-sectional plane. This classification method was used to categorize the sacral tumors, all of which were totally resected under the naked eye. Postoperatively symptoms were improved to varying degrees. CONCLUSIONS: The appropriate classification of sacral tumors and the selection of a corresponding surgical approach can improve the rate of total resection and the surgical safety, as well as decrease the recurrence rate.",cancer
"Free vascularised fibular graft for reconstruction of defects of the lower limb after resection of tumour. We describe a retrospective review of 38 cases of reconstruction following resection of the metaphysiodiaphysis of the lower limb for malignant bone tumours using free vascularised fibular grafts. The mean follow-up was for 7.6 years (0.4 to 18.4). The mean Musculoskeletal Tumor Society score was 27.2 (20 to 30). The score was significantly higher when the graft was carried out in a one-stage procedure after resection of the tumour rather than in two stages. Bony union was achieved in 89% of the cases. The overall mean time to union was 1.7 years (0.2 to 10.3). Free vascularised fibular transfer is a major operation with frequent, but preventable, complications which allows salvage of the limb with satisfactory functional results.",cancer
"Primary schwannoma of the thyroid gland: a case report. BACKGROUND: Primary schwannomas of the thyroid gland are extremely rare. These tumors most often present as asymptomatic solitary neck masses, slow growing and rarely malignant. Only 15 cases of intrathyroidal schwannoma have been reported in the literature, and few have been reported with fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology. CASE: A 14-year-old male patient presented with an asymptomatic left intrathyroidal mass. Radiologic studies revealed a circumscribed, marked hypoechoic mass with cystic portions in the left lobe of the thyroid gland on ultrasonography, pushing the trachea toward the right, visible side on computed tomography. FNA cytology of the mass exhibited a paucicellular smear composed of predominantly round to oval-shaped cells and occasional ovoid to spindle-shaped cells in loosely cohesive aggregates. On pathologic examination, the mass measured 60 x 45 x 30 mm and consisted of spindle-shaped cells arranged in fascicles in a whorling pattern in association with alternating hypercellular and hypocellular areas. CONCLUSION: Awareness of and understanding of the cytopathologic and radiologic characteristics of this entity are helpful in preoperative evaluation and correct treatment of intrathyroidal schwannoma.",cancer
"Fat replacement of the distal pancreas in a case of advanced gastric cancer. Preoperative computed tomography in a 67-year-old man admitted with type 2 advanced gastric cancer involving the upper body of the stomach revealed marked atrophy of the left lobe of the liver and atrophy of the distal pancreas. Total gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection was planned; however, additional distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy was also performed during the operation because of direct invasion of the pancreas by the gastric cancer. Histopathologic examination of the resected pancreas revealed the absence of lobules, acini, conduits, and pancreatic ducts, with only islets of Langerhans found scattered in the adipose tissue. The findings revealed that the gastric cancer had directly invaded the fat, replacing the distal pancreas. In patients with fat-replaced pancreas, preoperative evaluation of direct invasion of adjacent organs/tissues by gastric cancer is difficult.",cancer
"Private healthcare quality: applying a SERVQUAL model. PURPOSE: This paper seeks to develop and test the SERVQUAL model scale for measuring Malaysian private health service quality. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The study consists of 340 randomly selected participants visiting a private healthcare facility during a three-month data collection period. Data were analyzed using means, correlations, principal component and confirmatory factor analysis to establish the modified SERVQUAL scale's reliability, underlying dimensionality and convergent, discriminant validity. FINDINGS: Results indicate a moderate negative quality gap for overall Malaysian private healthcare service quality. Results also indicate a moderate negative quality gap on each service quality scale dimension. However, scale development analysis yielded excellent results, which can be used in wider healthcare policy and practice. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: Respondents were skewed towards a younger population, causing concern that the results might not represent all Malaysian age groups. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The study's major contribution is that it offers a way to assess private healthcare service quality. Second, it successfully develops a scale that can be used to measure health service quality in Malaysian contexts.",nocancer
"Pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma of gingivoalveolar sulcus: a case report. BACKGROUND: Leiomyosarcomas are rare tumors in the oral cavity. Oral leiomyosarcomas may arise primarily from bones (maxilla and mandible) or soft tissues. Pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma (PLMS) is a recently described morphologic variant with aggressive clinical behavior and low survival rate; it is exceptionally rare at intraoral sites. CASE: A 21-year-old male presented with a rapidly progressive growth arising from the gingiva. Fine needle aspiration cytology showed pleomorphic polygonal, plasmacytoid and spindled cells. Immunocytochemistry (IC) showed diffuse positivity for vimentin, desmin and cytokeratin, suggestive of high grade sarcoma. The patient underwent surgery, and total extended maxillectomy was performed; the diagnosis was PLMS on histology and IC. Further, detailed clinical and radiologic findings suggested primary high grade soft tissue sarcoma involving the underlying maxillary bone; thus, the final diagnosis was primary PLMS of the gingivoalveolar sulcus. CONCLUSION: Intraoral PLMS arising from gingivoalveolar sulcus in a young patient is an extremely rare lesion with aggressive behavior. Detailed clinicoradiologic findings, its correlation with morphology and IC are mandatory for its final diagnosis and also to exclude metastasis from other sites and primary tumor in bone.",cancer
"Age-related hearing loss, vitamin B12, and folate in the elderly. OBJECTIVE: Determine the correlation between the hearing threshold and the serum levels of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) and folic acid among elderly subjects (> 60 years) with age-related hearing loss (ARHL). STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Community. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Subjects included elderly who were found apparently healthy following repeated examination by physicians. The pure tone average (PTA) for the speech and high frequencies, and the serum folate and cobalamin were determined and the correlation found. RESULTS: The mean +/- SD values of serum folate among the subjects with normal PTA in the speech frequencies (0-30 dB) was 412.3 nmol/L +/- 17.6 nmol/L, while among those with hearing loss (HL), it was 279.1 nmol/L +/- 17.2 nmol/L (P = 0.01). In the high frequencies, the mean +/- SD values among the subjects with normal PTA was 426.3 nmol/L +/- 17.6 nmol/L, while among those with HL, it was 279.14 nmol/L +/- 171.2 nmol/L. The serum cobalamin among the subjects with normal PTA within the speech frequencies was 49.7 pmol/L +/- 9.4 pmol/L, while among those with speech-frequency HL, it was 42.6 pmol/L +/- 10.2 pmol/L. However, for high frequencies, the mean +/- SD values among the subjects with normal PTA was 47.4 pmol/L +/- 7.3 pmol/L, while among those with HL, it was 41.3 pmol/L +/- 9.2 pmol/L. Spearman's correlation revealed that low folate (correlation coefficient = -0.27, P = 0.01) and cyanocobalamin (correlation coefficient = -0.35, P = 0.02) were significantly associated with increasing hearing threshold in the high frequencies. After adjusting for age, serum folate (correlation coefficient = -0.01, P = 0.01) was significant, while vitamin B12 (correlation coefficient = -0.01, P = 0.74) was not. CONCLUSION: Serum folate was significantly lower among elderly with ARHL. Trials on nutritional supplementation may substantiate the role of serum folate in ARHL.",nocancer

"Association of a leukemic stem cell gene expression signature with clinical outcomes in acute myeloid leukemia. CONTEXT: In many cancers, specific subpopulations of cells appear to be uniquely capable of initiating and maintaining tumors. The strongest support for this cancer stem cell model comes from transplantation assays in immunodeficient mice, which indicate that human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is driven by self-renewing leukemic stem cells (LSCs). This model has significant implications for the development of novel therapies, but its clinical relevance has yet to be determined. OBJECTIVE: To identify an LSC gene expression signature and test its association with clinical outcomes in AML. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Retrospective study of global gene expression (microarray) profiles of LSC-enriched subpopulations from primary AML and normal patient samples, which were obtained at a US medical center between April 2005 and July 2007, and validation data sets of global transcriptional profiles of AML tumors from 4 independent cohorts (n = 1047). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Identification of genes discriminating LSC-enriched populations from other subpopulations in AML tumors; and association of LSC-specific genes with overall, event-free, and relapse-free survival and with therapeutic response. RESULTS: Expression levels of 52 genes distinguished LSC-enriched populations from other subpopulations in cell-sorted AML samples. An LSC score summarizing expression of these genes in bulk primary AML tumor samples was associated with clinical outcomes in the 4 independent patient cohorts. High LSC scores were associated with worse overall, event-free, and relapse-free survival among patients with either normal karyotypes or chromosomal abnormalities. For the largest cohort of patients with normal karyotypes (n = 163), the LSC score was significantly associated with overall survival as a continuous variable (hazard ratio [HR], 1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.22; log-likelihood P <.001). The absolute risk of death by 3 years was 57% (95% CI, 43%-67%) for the low LSC score group compared with 78% (95% CI, 66%-86%) for the high LSC score group (HR, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.3-2.7]; log-rank P = .002). In another cohort with available data on event-free survival for 70 patients with normal karyotypes, the risk of an event by 3 years was 48% (95% CI, 27%-63%) in the low LSC score group vs 81% (95% CI, 60%-91%) in the high LSC score group (HR, 2.4 [95% CI, 1.3-4.5]; log-rank P = .006). In multivariate Cox regression including age, mutations in FLT3 and NPM1, and cytogenetic abnormalities, the HRs for LSC score in the 3 cohorts with data on all variables were 1.07 (95% CI, 1.01-1.13; P = .02), 1.10 (95% CI, 1.03-1.17; P = .005), and 1.17 (95% CI, 1.05-1.30; P = .005). CONCLUSION: High expression of an LSC gene signature is independently associated with adverse outcomes in patients with AML.",cancer
"Combined clinical and radiological prognostic model in acute ischemic stroke. We sought to propose and test the validity ofa comprehensive prognostic model in middle cerebral artery-stroke treated with intravenous thrombolysis. A total of 127 consecutive patients (aged 70 +/- 12 years; 54% males) were included in this retrospective study. Variables included in our prognostic model were: NIHSS on admission (1-3 points), occurrence of hyperdense middle cerebral artery sign and early ischemic signs on baseline CT (1 point each), NIHSS at 24 hours (0-3 points), posttreatment hemorrhage (1 point), and infarct volume (0-4 points). The score range was 1-13, with higher values suggest unfavorable prognosis. Our prognostic score was correlated with the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 3 months after stroke [correlation coefficient of 0.62, P < 0.001] and can thus help early prediction of the functional outcome. Logistic regression showed that NIHSS at 24 hours and EICs on baseline CT were independent predictor of our prognostic score (adjusted odds ratio of 4.1 and 5). Adopting a cut-off value of prognostic score < or = 3 for favorable prognosis and > or = 7for unfavorable prognosis helped to predict the need for institutionalization and the functional outcome with higher accuracy and predictive values compared with using scores only based on NIHSS.",nocancer
"Significance of keratinocyte growth factor receptor in the proliferation of biliary tract cancer. BACKGROUND/AIM: Biliary tract carcinoma (BTC) has extremely poor prognosis because of rapid cancer cell proliferation. The aim of this study was to clarify the significance of keratinocyte growth factor receptor (KGFR) in the proliferation of BTC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression of KGFR in 34 surgical specimens of BTC was investigated by immunohistochemical staining. The effect of Ki23057, a small synthetic molecule that interrupts the autophosphorylation of KGFR, on the proliferation of human BTC cell lines was examined in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: The prognosis for BTC patients with KGFR-positive tumour was significantly poorer than that for those with KGFR-negative tumour. KGF significantly stimulated the proliferation of BTC cell lines. Ki23057 significantly decreased the growth of BTC cells in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSION: KGFR may play an important role in the proliferation of BTC. KGFR phosphorylation inhibitor, Ki23057, therefore appears to be therapeutically promising in BTC.",cancer
"Neuromonitor-guided repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. OBJECTIVE: Monitoring during thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair has included the use of cerebrospinal fluid drainage and motor and somatosensory evoked potentials. We report our experience with neuromonitoring-guided thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair. METHODS: Between November 2008 and January 2010, 105 thoracic aorta repairs were performed; 89% of patients (93/105) underwent repair using cerebrospinal fluid drainage and distal aortic perfusion. In addition, somatosensory and motor evoked potentials were monitored during repair, and active intraoperative maneuvers were undertaken in response to changes in the signals. Intraoperative maneuvers included intercostal artery reimplantation. RESULTS: In-hospital mortality for thoracic and thoracoabdominal aortic repair was 5.7% (6/105). Immediate spinal cord injury occurred in 1 patient (1%), and 3 patients (3%) had delayed neurologic deficit. Intercostal arteries were reattached in 85% of possible cases (51/60). Somatosensory evoked potentials achieved adequate readings in 99% of cases (102/103). Loss of somatosensory evoked potential was encountered in 26% of cases (27/102), and return of somatosensory evoked potentials occurred in all cases after intraoperative maneuvers. Motor evoked potentials achieved adequate readings in 96% of cases (99/103). Loss of motor evoked potential was encountered in 50% of cases (50/99), and return of motor evoked potentials occurred in all but 1 case (95%). This patient awoke with an immediate spinal neurologic deficit. CONCLUSIONS: Neuromonitoring using somatosensory evoked potentials and motor evoked potentials seems useful during thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Alterations in intraoperative conduct resulted in return of neuromonitoring signals. This suggests a benefit in intercostal artery reimplantation via increasing perfusion to the collateral network of the spinal cord. Further studies using neuromonitoring-guided repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms are warranted.",nocancer
"One versus two venous anastomoses in microvascular free flap surgery. BACKGROUND: The authors' goal was to determine whether one or two venous anastomoses results in superior blood flow through microvascular free flaps. METHODS: During flap harvest, blood velocity was measured in each of two venae comitantes using Doppler ultrasonography. Next, one of the two veins was occluded with a microvascular clamp and blood velocity was measured in the open vein. The clamp was then removed and placed on the other vein, and blood velocity was measured in the first vein. The pedicle was divided and microvascular anastomosis of either one or two veins was performed. Venous blood velocity was then compared between flaps with one versus two venous anastomoses. RESULTS: Eighty-one free flaps were performed. Before pedicle division, the peak venous blood velocity in each of the two venae comitantes averaged 6.3+/-4.8 cm/second. When one of the veins was occluded, the peak venous blood velocity increased to 19.5+/-17.3 cm/second (p<0.00001). One venous anastomosis was performed in 69 flaps and two venous anastomoses were performed in 12 flaps. The mean blood velocity in flaps in which one venous anastomosis was performed was greater than the mean blood velocity in either vein when two venous anastomoses were performed (13.1+/-7.3 cm/second versus 7.5+/-4.3 cm/second, respectively; p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: When one vena comitans is occluded, blood velocity in the second vena comitans increases significantly. Venous blood velocity is significantly greater after a single venous anastomosis than in either of two veins when two venous anastomoses are performed. These results argue against routinely performing two venous anastomoses.",cancer
"Indicated prevention: bridging the gap, one person at a time. In 2007, Riverside County, California, after identifying a gap between the substance abuse prevention and treatment services it offered to individuals, developed the Individual Prevention Services (IPS) program to fill that gap.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the oncologic and functional outcomes in patients undergoing primary transoral robotic surgery followed by adjuvant therapy as indicated with a minimum of 18-month follow-up for advanced oropharyngeal carcinoma. DESIGN: Prospective single-center cohort study. SETTING: Academic university health system and tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Forty-seven adults with newly diagnosed and previously untreated advanced oropharyngeal carcinoma. INTERVENTION: Transoral robotic surgery with staged neck dissection and adjuvant therapy as indicated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Margin status, recurrence, disease-specific and disease-free survival, gastrostomy tube dependence, and safety and efficacy end points. RESULTS: In the 47 patients enrolled with stages III and IV advanced oropharyngeal carcinoma, mean follow-up was 26.6 months. There was no intraoperative or postoperative mortality. Resection margins were positive in 1 patient (2%). At last follow-up, local recurrence was identified in 1 patient (2%), regional recurrence in 2 (4%), and distant recurrence in 4 (9%). Disease-specific survival was 98% (45 of 46 patients) at 1 year and 90% (27 of 30 patients) at 2 years. Based on pathologic risk stratification, 18 of 47 patients (38%) avoided chemotherapy, and 5 patients (11%) did not receive adjuvant radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy in their treatment regimen. At minimum follow-up of 1 year, only 1 patient required a gastrostomy tube. CONCLUSIONS: This novel transoral robotic surgery treatment regimen offers disease control, survival, and safety commensurate with standard treatments and an unexpected beneficial outcome of gastrostomy dependency rates that are markedly lower than those reported with standard nonsurgical therapies.",cancer
"Soluble MICB serum levels correlate with disease stage and survival rate in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma. BACKGROUND: Expression of ligands of natural killer group 2D (NKG2D) immunoreceptors, such as major histocompatibility complex class I-related chain A/B (MICA/B), has been proposed to play an important role in tumour immunosurveillance. Soluble forms of MICA/B are increased in sera of cancer patients and are postulated to impair antitumour immune response by downregulating expression of NKG2D immunoreceptors. Serum levels of soluble MICA have been shown to be of diagnostic significance in malignant diseases. AIMS: The potential of soluble MICB (sMICB) as a marker for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) was investigated. RESULTS: sMICB levels did not differ significantly from those in normal control individuals. However, the findings indicate that sMICB levels are significantly increased in stage IV OSCC and high sMICB levels are significantly associated with decreased survival rates in patients.",cancer
"CMT2C with vocal cord paresis associated with short stature and mutations in the TRPV4 gene. BACKGROUND: Recently, mutations in the transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 4 gene (TRPV4) have been reported in Charcot-Marie-Tooth Type 2C (CMT2C) with vocal cord paresis. Other mutations in this same gene have been described in separate families with various skeletal dysplasias. Further clarification is needed of the different phenotypes associated with this gene. METHODS: We performed clinical evaluation, electrophysiology, and genetic analysis of the TRPV4 gene in 2 families with CMT2C. RESULTS: Two multigenerational families had a motor greater than sensory axonal neuropathy associated with variable vocal cord paresis. The vocal cord paresis varied from absent to severe, requiring permanent tracheotomy in 2 subjects. One family with mild neuropathy also manifested pronounced short stature, more than 2 SD below the average height for white Americans. There was one instance of dolichocephaly. A novel S542Y mutation in the TRPV4 gene was identified in this family. The other family had a more severe, progressive, motor neuropathy with sensory loss, but less remarkable short stature and an R315W mutation in TRPV4. Third cranial nerve involvement and sleep apnea occurred in one subject in each family. CONCLUSION: CMT2C with axonal neuropathy, vocal cord paresis, and short stature is a unique syndrome associated with mutations in the TRPV4 gene. Mutations in TRPV4 can cause abnormalities in bone, peripheral nerve, or both and may result in highly variable orthopedic and neurologic phenotypes.",nocancer
"Thought for food: imagined consumption reduces actual consumption. The consumption of a food typically leads to a decrease in its subsequent intake through habituation--a decrease in one's responsiveness to the food and motivation to obtain it. We demonstrated that habituation to a food item can occur even when its consumption is merely imagined. Five experiments showed that people who repeatedly imagined eating a food (such as cheese) many times subsequently consumed less of the imagined food than did people who repeatedly imagined eating that food fewer times, imagined eating a different food (such as candy), or did not imagine eating a food. They did so because they desired to eat it less, not because they considered it less palatable. These results suggest that mental representation alone can engender habituation to a stimulus.",nocancer
"Overexpression of gelsolin in human cervical carcinoma and its clinicopathological significance. OBJECTIVES: Cervical carcinoma is the second most common cause of death from gynecological cancers worldwide. Knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying the tumorigenesis of cervical cancer cell, except human papilloma virus infection, is limited. METHODS: A microarray was used to study the differential expression of genes in cancerous tissues to identify new molecular markers for diagnosis and prognosis. Their differential expression was confirmed with Western blotting and immunohistochemical analyses. The clinical correlations and prognostic significance of the aberrantly expressed proteins were evaluated to identify novel biomarkers of cervical cancer. RESULTS: The expression of gelsolin was significantly upregulated in 78% of patients with cervical cancer, and gelsolin was selected for further study. Gelsolin expression was stronger in cervical tumor tissues than in the surrounding noncancerous tissues (P<0.001). Gelsolin expression in the plasma of cervical cancer patients was increased 2.2-fold compared with that of healthy control subjects (P<0.001). The levels of plasma gelsolin in the early and late stages were significantly different (P=0.006). According to immunohistochemical analysis, increased gelsolin expression was associated with histological type and FIGO stage II. The 5-year overall survival and recurrence-free survival rates for the low-expression group (cut-off=115) were significantly higher than those of the high-expression group. Cancer cells with reduced gelsolin expression exhibited reduced migration and proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide strong evidence that gelsolin plays an important role in cellular proliferation and migration in cervical cancer and suggest that gelsolin is a promising marker for cervical cancer screening and prognosis.",cancer
"The risk factors and the treatment course of cerebral venous thrombosis: an experience of 41 cases. BACKGROUND: The present study was designed to describe the characteristics, risk factors and prognosis of patients diagnosed with CVT in our center. METHOD: The present retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted on patients diagnosed with cerebral vein or sinus thrombosis based on the patients' clinical presentation and the findings of the imaging studies between 2003 and 2008. The patients were studied for possible risk factors and the resultant outcome after terminating the therapeutic course. RESULTS: Headache, the most common symptom reported in 80% of the cases, was considered the first symptom in only 46% of these patients. Coma, focal motor deficit at presentation, hemorrhagic conversion of infarction and thrombosis in more than one sinus were factors associated with unfavorable outcome in these patients. CONCLUSION: Physicians should always have CVT in mind while examining patients particularly women on pills who complain about headache. More studies however are needed to point out more specific presentations which would lead to the early diagnosis of CVT in the patients.",nocancer
"Injuries to the lower back in elite fast bowlers: acute stress changes on MRI predict stress fracture. In our study, the aims were to describe the changes in the appearance of the lumbar spine on MRI in elite fast bowlers during a follow-up period of one year, and to determine whether these could be used to predict the presence of a stress fracture of the posterior elements. We recruited 28 elite fast bowlers with a mean age of 19 years (16 to 24) who were training and playing competitively at the start of the study. They underwent baseline MRI (season 1) and further scanning (season 2) after one year to assess the appearance of the lumbar intervertebral discs and posterior bony elements. The incidence of low back pain and the amount of playing and training time lost were also recorded. In total, 15 of the 28 participants (53.6%) showed signs of acute bone stress on either the season 1 or season 2 MR scans and there was a strong correlation between these findings and the later development of a stress fracture (p < 0.001). The prevalence of intervertebral disc degeneration was relatively low. There was no relationship between disc degeneration on the season 1 MR scans and subsequent stress fracture. Regular lumbar MR scans of asymptomatic elite fast bowlers may be of value in detecting early changes of bone stress and may allow prompt intervention aimed at preventing a stress fracture and avoiding prolonged absence from cricket.",nocancer
"Development of ipilimumab: contribution to a new paradigm for cancer immunotherapy. Identification of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) as a key negative regulator of T-cell activity led to development of the fully human, monoclonal antibody ipilimumab to block CTLA-4 and potentiate antitumor T-cell responses. Animal studies first provided insight into the ability of an anti-CTLA-4 antibody to cause tumor regression, particularly in combination regimens. Early clinical studies defined ipilimumab pharmacokinetics and possibilities for combinability. Phase II trials of ipilimumab in advanced melanoma showed objective responses, but a greater number of patients had disease stabilization. In a phase III trial, ipilimumab was the first agent to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival in patients with previously treated, advanced melanoma. The adverse event profile associated with ipilimumab was primarily immune-related. Adverse events can be severe and life-threatening, but most were reversible using treatment guidelines. Ipilimumab monotherapy exhibits conventional and new patterns of activity in advanced melanoma, with a delayed separation of Kaplan-Meier survival curves. The observation of some new response patterns with ipilimumab, which are not captured by standard response criteria, led to novel criteria for the evaluation of immunotherapy in solid tumors. Overall, lessons from the development of ipilimumab contributed to a new clinical paradigm for cancer immunotherapy evolved by the Cancer Immunotherapy Consortium.",cancer
