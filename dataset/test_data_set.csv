"Tobacco smoking and colorectal cancer: a population-based case-control study in Newfoundland and Labrador. OBJECTIVE: Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) has the highest incidence rate of both colorectal cancer (CRC) and smoking prevalence in Canada. The objective of this study was to examine if CRC is associated with smoking in this population. METHODS: Newly diagnosed cases identified between 1999 and 2003 were frequency-matched by 5-year age group and sex with controls selected from the residents of NL through random digit dialing. A total of 702 cases and 717 controls consented to participate in the study and completed a set of self-administered questionnaires. Measures of tobacco use included type of tobacco, age of initiation of smoking, years of smoking, years since started smoking, number of cigarettes smoked daily, pack years, and years since abstention from smoking. Odds ratios were estimated using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: In comparison with non-smokers, former and current smokers were at a significantly elevated risk of CRC with corresponding odds ratios of 1.36 and 1.96. The risk significantly increased with cigarette smoking years, the amount of cigarettes smoked daily, and cigarette pack years. The risk significantly decreased with years of abstention from smoking cigarettes. This association was stronger among drinkers and in men. In addition, this effect was observed to be slightly stronger for rectum than colon cancer. DISCUSSION: In summary, cigarette smoking increased the risk of CRC in the NL population. The risk of CRC associated with cigarette smoking varies by sex, drinking status, and site of CRC.",cancer"Clinicopathological study of male breast cancer in Nigerians and a review of the literature. BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is rare in men, accounting for approximately 1% of all cases of breast carcinoma. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incidence, presentation, histopathological types, management and outcome of male patients with breast cancer treated at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, Benin City, Nigeria. METHODS: A 20 year (1987-2006) retrospective study of all male patients with breast cancer was done. Clinic demographic data regarding age, sex, clinical information, treatment and follow up were obtained from request cards and case files. Slides were retrieved from the archives of the Department of Pathology and reviewed. RESULTS: Sixteen cases of male breast cancer were encountered. This comprised 18.4% of the breast lesions in males and 2.8% of all breast cancers seen in the Department during the 20 year study period. The ages of patients ranged from 35-90 years with a mean age of 64.4 years. Delay in patient presentation to physician ranged from 14-49 months. Clinically, patients presented mostly with a self-detected lump (87.5%), or ulceration (68.8%), nipple discharge (43.8%) and nipple bleeding (25.0%). Unilaterality was observed in 87.5% of cases were while 12.5% of cases were bilateral (metachronous). Invasive ductal carcinoma (81.25%) was the predominant histological type of cancer. Stage IV disease was most commonly encountered (43.8%). Eleven (68.8%) patients had modified radical mastectomy. Only 31.3% patients came for follow-up, for a median duration of 10 months. CONCLUSION: Male breast cancer is rare and patients present late with advanced disease. Education needs to be intensified to increase awareness of the disease.",cancer"Detection of micrometastases in lymph nodes using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for cytokeratin 20 (CK-20)--a pilot study. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to detect micrometastases in lymph nodes in patients with rectal cancer following neoadjuvant therapy, staged node negative by routine histology. PATIENTS AND SETTING: Mesenteric lymph nodes from patients who have undergone neoadjuvant therapy for rectal cancer were harvested during surgery. Nodes were bisected and one half was sent for haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and evaluated by a single pathologist. The other half was examined for CK20 by RT-PCR. The technique was validated by testing mesenteric lymph nodes with known metastases and nodes from patients without cancer. Twenty one lymph nodes from 6 patients (median age 46 years, range 25-55) which were negative for tumour deposits by H & E stain were assessed for micro-metastases. RESULTS: All 21 nodes which were histologically negative for metastases were positive for micrometastases. Two nodes with known metastases were positive for CK20 and 3 nodes from non cancer patients were negative for CK20. CONCLUSIONS: Detection of CK20 is accurate in identification of rectal cancer micro-metastasing to lymph nodes. Assessment of nodes by H & E histology risks under staging.",cancer"Epiglottoplasty for reconstruction of defects after laryngectomy with partial pharyngectomy. OBJECTIVES: We present a novel use of sliding epiglottoplasty as an alternative method for closing mucosal defects in selected laryngectomies with partial pharyngectomy. METHODS: Sliding epiglottoplasty as described and advocated by Sedlacek, Bouche, Kambic, and Tucker for reconstruction in partial laryngectomies was used to close the defects after laryngectomy with partial pharyngectomy in 17 patients with advanced hypopharyngeal cancers as primary therapy (16 patients) and as post-radiochemotherapy therapy (1 patient). RESULTS: All reconstructions were successful. Primary closures were achieved without additional morbidity, there were no pharyngocutaneous fistulas, and all patients resumed deglutition. Ten patients acquired esophageal speech, speech valves were inserted in 5 cases, and 2 patients required the use of an electrolarynx. CONCLUSIONS: If the oncological circumstances allow its preservation in laryngectomy with partial pharyngectomy, the epiglottis is an ideal structure for closing the defect; it is a local tissue with shape, thickness, rigidity, and borders that match the recipient site. In comparison to distant pedicled or free microvascular flaps, the epiglottoplasty is a shorter procedure, requires a smaller surgical team, results in less trauma, has a lower incidence of complications, and enables faster recovery. It is surprising that this elegant, successful, and generally accepted larynx preservation procedure has not been recognized as useful for larger reconstructions.",cancer"Prevalence of acoustic neuroma associated with each configuration of pure tone audiogram in patients with asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss. OBJECTIVES: The criteria have not yet been established for identifying the configuration of a pure tone audiogram constituting abnormal results that warrant further investigation. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of acoustic neuroma associated with each configuration of the pure tone audiogram in patients with asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of 500 patients 15 years of age or older who had asymmetric SNHL and had undergone magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: The prevalence of acoustic neuroma in these patients was 2.6% (13 of 500). The prevalence of acoustic neuroma in each audiometric configuration was as follows: 7.1% (3 of 42) for a basin-shaped loss (odds ratio [OR] versus overall prevalence, 2.88; p = 0.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79 to 10.54), 4.7% (5 of 107) for a flat loss, 3.4% (2 of 58) for total deafness, 2.9% (1 of 34) for a high-frequency sloping audiogram, and 2.5% (2 of 81) for a high-frequency steep audiogram. The prevalence in patients with nonimproving idiopathic sudden deafness was 8.1% (OR, 3.29; p = 0.06; 95% CI, 1.13 to 9.55). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, 2.9% to 8.1% of patients with a characteristic configuration of the pure tone audiogram and symptoms of nonimproving or progressive idiopathic sudden deafness may have acoustic neuroma.",cancer"Natural history of incidental World Health Organization grade II gliomas. OBJECTIVE: Seizure is the presenting symptom in most of World Health Organization grade II gliomas (GIIGs). Rarely, a GIIG is discovered incidentally on imaging. Little is known about the natural course and prognosis of incidental GIIGs. The aim of the present study is to characterize their natural history and to investigate whether their clinical and radiological behaviors differ from those of symptomatic GIIGs. METHODS: The clinical and radiological findings, treatments, and outcomes of 47 histologically-proven incidental GIIGs were compared with those of 1249 symptomatic GIIGs. RESULTS: Incidental GIIGs differ significantly from symptomatic GIIGs: they have a female predominance (p = 0.05), smaller initial tumor volumes (p < 0.001), lower incidence of contrast enhancement (p = 0.009), and are more likely to undergo gross total surgical removal (p < 0.001). Proliferation rates were similar to that observed among symptomatic GIIGs. Younger age at the time of discovery, frontal lobes, and noneloquent brain regions were associated with incidental GIIGs, as compared to their symptomatic counterparts. When not treated, incidental GIIGs demonstrated radiological growth (median velocity of diametric expansion at 3.5 mm/year), and became symptomatic at a median interval of 48 months after radiological discovery. Overall, incidental discovery was associated with a significant survival benefit (p = 0.04). INTERPRETATION: Incidental GIIGs are progressive tumors leading to clinical transformation toward symptomatic GIIGs. They may represent an earlier step in the natural history of a glioma than the symptomatic GIIGs.",cancer"Utilizing targeted cancer therapeutic agents in combination: novel approaches and urgent requirements. The rapid development of new therapeutic agents that target specific molecular pathways involved in tumour cell proliferation provides an unprecedented opportunity to achieve a much higher degree of biochemical specificity than previously possible with traditional chemotherapeutic anticancer agents. However, the lack of specificity of these established chemotherapeutic drugs allowed a relatively straightforward approach to their use in combination therapies. Developing a paradigm for combining new, molecularly targeted agents, on the other hand, is substantially more complex. The abundance of molecular data makes it possible, at least in theory, to predict how such agents might interact across crucial growth control networks. Initial strategies to examine molecularly targeted agent combinations have produced a small number of successes in the clinic. However, for most of these combination strategies, both in preclinical models and in patients, it is not clear whether the agents being combined actually hit their targets to induce growth inhibition. Here, we consider the initial approach of the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) to the evaluation of combinations of molecularly targeted anticancer agents in patients and provide a description of several new approaches that the NCI has initiated to improve the effectiveness of combination-targeted therapy for cancer.",cancer"Dueling models in head and neck tumor formation. The two leading models that have been used to explain tumor progression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are the stochastic clonal evolution model, in which many tumor cells are individually capable of recapitulating the entire tumor mass, and the cancer stem hierarchy model, in which only rare totipotential tumor stem cells can recapitulate the tumor. In this issue, Cameron et al use cell surface marker and clonal cell analyses in combination with a xenotransplant approach to provide data that support the stochastic clonal evolution model in HNSCC. This interpretation is subject, however, to limitations inherent in the experimental approach employed. Understanding the basis of tumor progression in HNSCC as well as other cancers should be further explored because of important implications for effective treatments.",cancer"A biochemical mechanism for the oncogenic potential of the p110beta catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Class I PI3-kinases signal downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases and G protein-coupled receptors and have been implicated in tumorigenesis. Although the oncogenic potential of the PI3-kinase subunit p110alpha requires its mutational activation, other p110 isoforms can induce transformation when overexpressed in the wild-type state. In wild-type p110alpha, N345 in the C2 domain forms hydrogen bonds with D560 and N564 in the inter-SH2 (iSH2) domain of p85, and mutations of p110alpha or p85 that disrupt this interface lead to increased basal activity and transformation. Sequence analysis reveals that N345 in p110alpha aligns with K342 in p110beta. This difference makes wild-type p110beta analogous to a previously described oncogenic mutant, p110alpha-N345K. We now show that p110beta is inhibited by p85 to a lesser extent than p110alpha and is not differentially inhibited by wild-type p85 versus p85 mutants that disrupt the C2-iSH2 domain interface. Similar results were seen in soft agar and focus-formation assays, where p110beta was similar to p110alpha-N345K in transforming potential. Inhibition of p110beta by p85 was enhanced by a K342N mutation in p110beta, which led to decreased activity in vitro, decreased basal Akt and ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K1) activation, and decreased transformation in NIH 3T3 cells. Moreover, unlike wild-type p110beta, p110beta-K342N was differentially regulated by wild-type and mutant p85, suggesting that the inhibitory C2-iSH2 interface is functional in this mutant. This study shows that the enhanced transforming potential of p110beta is the result of its decreased inhibition by p85, due to the disruption of an inhibitory C2-iSH2 domain interface.",cancer"Gene therapy-mediated delivery of targeted cytotoxins for glioma therapeutics. Restricting the cytotoxicity of anticancer agents by targeting receptors exclusively expressed on tumor cells is critical when treating infiltrative brain tumors such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). GBMs express an IL-13 receptor (IL13Ralpha2) that differs from the physiological IL4R/IL13R receptor. We developed a regulatable adenoviral vector (Ad.mhIL-4.TRE.mhIL-13-PE) encoding a mutated human IL-13 fused to Pseudomonas exotoxin (mhIL-13-PE) that specifically binds to IL13Ralpha2 to provide sustained expression, effective anti-GBM cytotoxicity, and minimal neurotoxicity. The therapeutic Ad also encodes mutated human IL-4 that binds to the physiological IL4R/IL13R without interacting with IL13Ralpha2, thus inhibiting potential binding of mhIL-13-PE to normal brain cells. Using intracranial GBM xenografts and syngeneic mouse models, we tested the Ad.mhIL-4.TRE.mhIL-13-PE and two protein formulations, hIL-13-PE used in clinical trials (Cintredekin Besudotox) and a second-generation mhIL-13-PE. Cintredekin Besudotox doubled median survival without eliciting long-term survival and caused severe neurotoxicity; mhIL-13-PE led to approximately 40% long-term survival, eliciting severe neurological toxicity at the high dose tested. In contrast, Ad-mediated delivery of mhIL-13-PE led to tumor regression and long-term survival in over 70% of the animals, without causing apparent neurotoxicity. Although Cintredekin Besudotox was originally developed to target GBM, when tested in a phase III trial it failed to achieve clinical endpoints and revealed neurotoxicity. Limitations of Cintredekin Besudotox include its short half-life, which demanded frequent or continued administration, and binding to IL4R/IL13R, present in normal brain cells. These shortcomings were overcome by our therapeutic Ad, thus representing a significant advance in the development of targeted therapeutics for GBM.",cancer"Improving outcomes for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most commonly occurring form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the western world. Until the mid 1990s the incidence of DLBCL increased in both sexes, across racial categories, and across all age groups except the very young, the etiology of most cases remains unknown. DLBCL is associated with an aggressive natural history, but it can be cured with combination chemotherapy regimens like cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP), which has been the mainstay of therapy for several decades. Remarkable progress has been made in understanding the biological heterogeneity of DLBCL and in improving survival for DLBCL patients with novel combinations of chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Gene expression profiling (GEP) has uncovered DLBCL subtypes that have distinct clinical behaviors and prognoses, and the addition of the monoclonal antibody, rituximab, to CHOP has markedly improved outcomes. Future approaches to DLBCL management will use molecular signatures identified through GEP to provide prognostic information and to isolate therapeutic targets that are being evaluated for DLBCL patients who relapse or those with high risk disease.",cancer"Mechanism of synergistic antitumor effect of sorafenib and interferon-alpha on treatment of renal cell carcinoma. PURPOSE: The multikinase and tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib has antitumor activity in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. Recent reports show the ability of sorafenib to synergize with interferon-alpha, leading to greater antitumor activity. We examined the underlying mechanism of sorafenib and interferon-alpha synergism for renal cell carcinoma treatment in vitro and in tumor bearing murine models. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used murine and human renal cell carcinoma cell lines for in vitro cell proliferation assay. ACHN (ATCC(R)) and RENCA tumors were subcutaneously transplanted into NCr-nu/nu and syngeneic BALB/c mice (Charles River Laboratories, Yokohama, Japan), respectively. Mice were treated with sorafenib and/or interferon-alpha, and tumor growth was monitored. Immunological assays were done in the RENCA model. RESULTS: In the ACHN and RENCA cell lines combination index analysis clearly revealed the synergistic antiproliferative effects of interferon-alpha and sorafenib in vitro. In the ACHN NCr-nu/nu model we clearly noted the synergistic antitumor effects of interferon-alpha and sorafenib, indicating the synergistic direct effects of each drug on tumor growth. In the RENCA BALB/c model flow cytometry showed no change in the proportion of lymphocytes. However, while sorafenib alone did not induce natural killer or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity against RENCA in that model, interferon-alpha alone or combined with sorafenib induced natural killer and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show the synergistic activity of interferon-alpha and sorafenib. These findings provided the rationale for combination therapy with interferon-alpha and sorafenib in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma.",cancer"Histone deacetylase inhibitor potentiates anticancer effect of docetaxel via modulation of Bcl-2 family proteins and tubulin in hormone refractory prostate cancer cells. PURPOSE: We evaluated the antitumor effects of docetaxel (Sigma(R)) and histone deacetylase inhibitors in hormone refractory prostate cancer cells, and analyzed the mechanism by which combination treatment induced cell death. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used LNCaP, DU145 and PC3 cells (ATCC(R)) to evaluate the in vitro apoptotic effects of histone deacetylase inhibitors and their combinations with docetaxel as well as the molecular mechanisms. The DU145 xenograft model was used to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of PXD101 combined with docetaxel. RESULTS: Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid or PXD101 inhibited the growth of hormone dependent LNCaP cells, and hormone independent DU145 and PC3 cells. It increased sub-G1 population and activated caspase-8, 9 and 3, indicating apoptosis induction. Pretreating DU145 cells with docetaxel followed by histone deacetylase inhibitors showed significant synergistic cytotoxicity compared with that of simultaneous co-treatment or reverse sequential treatment. Pretreatment with docetaxel followed by histone deacetylase inhibitors increased the apoptotic sub-G1 population, caspase activation and tubulin acetylation compared with that of docetaxel alone. Combination treatment decreased Mcl-1 and Bcl-xl, and increased t-Bid, Bik and Bim. Combined docetaxel and PXD101 reduced tumor size with efficacy equivalent to that of a double dose of docetaxel alone in the DU145 xenograft model. CONCLUSIONS: These preclinical results indicate that the sequential combination of docetaxel and histone deacetylase inhibitors led to a synergistic increase in the death of hormone refractory prostate cancer cells via intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways by modulating Bcl-2 family proteins and tubulin in vitro and in vivo. Results suggest that this combination may be a new therapeutic modality in patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer.",cancer"DNA damage-mediated induction of a chemoresistant niche. While numerous cell-intrinsic processes are known to play decisive roles in chemotherapeutic response, relatively little is known about the impact of the tumor microenvironment on therapeutic outcome. Here, we use a well-established mouse model of Burkitt's lymphoma to show that paracrine factors in the tumor microenvironment modulate lymphoma cell survival following the administration of genotoxic chemotherapy. Specifically, IL-6 and Timp-1 are released in the thymus in response to DNA damage, creating a ""chemo-resistant niche"" that promotes the survival of a minimal residual tumor burden and serves as a reservoir for eventual tumor relapse. Notably, IL-6 is released acutely from thymic endothelial cells in a p38-dependent manner following genotoxic stress, and this acute secretory response precedes the gradual induction of senescence in tumor-associated stromal cells. Thus, conventional chemotherapies can induce tumor regression while simultaneously eliciting stress responses that protect subsets of tumor cells in select anatomical locations from drug action.",cancer"Preparation and evaluation of carborane analogues of tamoxifen. A stereoselective synthesis of closo carborane analogues of tamoxifen was developed where the products represent a new approach to developing metabolically robust SERMs. The A-ring found in the backbone of tamoxifen was replaced with an ortho carborane cluster; the product was determined to be the desired Z isomer, which showed superior chemical stability to tamoxifen both in solution and in the solid state. By use of microwave heating, it was possible to convert some of the Z carborane tamoxifen analogue to the corresponding E isomer. Cell growth assays using both isomers and a carborane that is known to target the ER were conducted using estrogen receptor (ER) positive and ER negative human breast cancer cells with and without the presence of estradiol (E2). The Z carborane isomer was able to inhibit cell proliferation better than tamoxifen in an E2 free environment, while the E isomer inhibited cell growth better than tamoxifen when E2 was present.",cancer"Familial pleuropulmonary blastoma in Australia. We present three cases of pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) in Australian children. Each had a family history of childhood tumors which collectively included PPB, infant lung cyst, cystic nephroma, medullo-epithelioma and a Sertoli-Leydig ovarian tumor. Two of the patients also had additional malignancies: a concurrent bladder rhabdomyosarcoma and a post therapy non-PPB malignant lung tumor. In two cases, the family histories were elicited years after the PPB diagnosis. Archived pathology material allowed revision of pathologic diagnoses from decades earlier. These cases illustrate the importance of detailed inquiry into family medical history and the pleiotropy of the PPB-related familial cancer predisposition syndrome, which appears to result from heterozygous DICER1 mutations.",cancer"Bilateral conjunctival extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma. Extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas (EMZLs), while relatively common in adults, are rare entities in the pediatric population. A subclass of the typically aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas, the few reported pediatric cases indicate that, as in adults, these tumors tend to be indolent. We present a case of EMZL arising in the conjunctivae in a 9-year-old male with bilateral disease. The patient was treated with surgical excision alone and has remained disease-free 6 years after the operation.",cancer"Child-related determinants of health-related quality of life in children with brain tumours 1 year after diagnosis. OBJECTIVES: Infratentorial tumour site and health-related quality of life (HRQL) 1 month after diagnosis have been shown to predict HRQL 1 year after diagnosis in children with brain tumours. This study aimed to identify additional early child-related determinants of parent- and child-report HRQL. METHODS: Longitudinal prospective study. Semi-structured interviews took place approximately 1 and 12 months after diagnosis. HRQL was measured using the self- and parent-report Pediatric Quality of Life Scales (PedsQL 4.0) Total Scale Score and Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) multi-attribute utility function. Child variables included performance and verbal IQ, general memory, selective attention executive function, behaviour problems, adaptive behaviour, symptoms of depression and anxiety and event related anxiety. Univariate analyses were used to identify potential early predictors of HRQL. Regression analysis was then used to identify the most important determinants of HRQL at 1 year. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients completed the 12-month interviews. Multivariate analysis showed infratentorial tumour site remained an important determinant of HRQL 1 year after diagnosis. Infratentorial tumour site and selective attention at 1 month generally best predicted poor self- and parent-report HRQL at 12 months. Adaptive behaviour and performance IQ may be important. CONCLUSION: Selective attention and infratentorial tumour site are most important in predicting both parent- and self-report HRQL at 1 year after diagnosis. Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings. Cognitive remediation or/and pharmacological intervention, particularly aimed at children with infratentorial tumours may improve attention and subsequently HRQL and both merit further investigation.",cancer"Nutritional intake of long-term survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: evidence for bone health interventional opportunities. BACKGROUND: Survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are vulnerable to exaggeration of the aging process including decreased bone mineral density (BMD). As little is known about their dietary or nutrient intake that may affect their long-term bone health, we examined nutrient intake in long-term survivors of childhood ALL. PROCEDURE: Survivors (n = 164) of childhood ALL who had completed treatment for at least 5 years and were in continuous remission, completed a 110-item food questionnaire that reflected dietary intake over the previous year. The analyzed cohort comprised 34 females and 38 males younger than 19 years and 45 females and 47 males at least 19 years. Reported nutrient intake and food selection were compared with age-specific Recommended Dietary Allowance and USDA Pyramid Food Guide. Body mass index was compared to the general US population, adjusted for age, gender, Tanner stage and race. RESULTS: Less than 30% of participants met recommended dietary intakes for vitamin D, calcium, potassium, or magnesium regardless of age. Mean daily caloric intake was 2,204 kcal (51% from carbohydrates) for younger and 2,160 kcal (49% from carbohydrates) for older participants. Energy intake from sweets was 70% higher than recommended. Participants < 19 years were less likely to have a healthy weight (odds ratio 0.48, 95% CI 0.30-0.79); > 19 years more likely to be overweight (odds ratio 1.95, 95% CI 1.11-3.32, P < 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of childhood ALL need careful dietary intervention to optimize long-term health.",cancer"Correlation between pre- or postoperative MRI findings and cerebellar sequelae in patients with medulloblastomas. INTRODUCTION: Immediate and delayed cerebellar dysfunction may be expected after surgical resection of a medulloblastoma. We investigated whether pre-operative and delayed post-operative MRI may correlate with such sequelae. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The data of 31 patients in continuous complete remission after removal of medulloblastoma, irradiation and chemotherapy, were retrospectively reviewed. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was analyzed for the following items: preoperative MRI (ratio of the surface of the tumor/posterior fossa, presence of ventricular dilatation or tonsilar hernia, involvement of the dentate nucleus) and delayed post-operative MRI (amount of cerebellar parenchyma removed, degree of cerebellar atrophy, presence of T1 hypointense regions in remaining cerebellar area and removal of region containing dentate nucleus). These data were correlated with immediate and long-term cerebellar syndrome and daily life repercussions. RESULTS: On preoperative MRI, the ratio of the surface of the tumor/posterior fossa and the presence of tonsilar hernia were significantly correlated with long-term sequelae on speech (respectively P = 0.027 and P = 0.05). Initial supratentorial ventricular dilatation was correlated with ability to sustain adequately daily tasks (P = 0.002). On delayed MRI, cerebellar atrophy was inversely correlated with ability to sustain daily tasks (P = 0.002). Hypointense T1 territory in remaining cerebellar parenchyma significantly correlated with immediate post-operative cerebellar syndrome (P = 0.01) and showed a tendency for post-operative mutism (P = 0.087) but was not correlated with any long-term sequelae. CONCLUSION: Increased cranial pressure on initial MRI and cerebellar atrophy detected on subsequent MRI studies correlated with immediate and long-term cerebellar sequelae.",cancer"KIR receptor-ligand incompatibility predicts killing of osteosarcoma cell lines by allogeneic NK cells. BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) incompatible, alloreactive natural killer (NK) cells has been primarily documented in hematological malignancies following stem-cell transplant. This effect has not been thoroughly evaluated for pediatric solid tumors. In this study, we evaluated KIR receptor-ligand incompatibility of NK cells against osteosarcoma cell lines. PROCEDURE: Following the KIR receptor-ligand mismatch model, MHC I cell surface expression and KIR ligand mRNA content of 3 osteosarcoma cell lines was determined by flow cytometry and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), respectively. NK cells were isolated from healthy volunteer donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and KIR surface expression determined by flow cytometry. An Annexin-V based flow cytometric killing assay was used to determine % of dying osteosarcoma target cells by donor NK effector cells. RESULTS: One of seven healthy volunteer donors tested lacked phenotypic expression of one KIR. However, variable expression of KIR ligands was observed in 3 osteosarcoma cell lines. The highest rates of dying cells were seen in osteosarcoma cells with the lowest KIR ligand expression. Following down-regulation of KIR ligand expression, an increased susceptibility to NK cell-mediated killing was observed in a previously NK-resistant osteosarcoma cell line. CONCLUSIONS: Variable MHC I and KIR ligand expression was observed in osteosarcoma cell lines and this resulted in variable susceptibility to NK cell-mediated killing predicted by the degree of KIR receptor-ligand incompatibility. Collectively, these data provide rationale for the study of KIR incompatible stem-cell transplant for osteosarcoma, although further studies with fresh osteosarcoma samples are necessary.",cancer"Monitoring of minimal residual disease in acute myeloid leukemia with frequent and rare patient-specific NPM1 mutations. Nucleophosmin (NPM1) mutations in exon 12 are the most common genetic alternation in cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). Although mutation types A, B, and D represent the majority of cases, rare mutation variants of the NPM1 gene in individual patients do occur. In this study, we have evaluated a novel, DNA-based real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) for the detection of three of the most commonly occurring mutations and for six rare patient-specific mutation types, which represent 28% of all of the NPM1 mutations in our group of 25 CN-AML patients. Furthermore, the prognostic relevance of NPM1-based monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD) in peripheral blood (PB), bone marrow (BM), and in specific cell subsets (CD34(+), CD34(-), CD34(dim)) of BM were evaluated. In 80% of the evaluable patients, a molecular relapse preceded a hematological relapse. Moreover, in this subset of patients, the molecular relapse occurred at a median of 97 days before the hematological relapse. Our compartment analysis showed a strong correlation between BM and PB (r = 0.907, P < 0.001) as well as a high copy number of mutated NPM1 in CD34(+) BM cells. In conclusion, we have demonstrated applicability of our presented RQ-PCR method for a large percentage of mutated NPM1 patients with CN-AML as well as the usefulness for long-term follow-up monitoring of MRD and the prediction of hematological relapse.",cancer"Distant metastasis occurs late during the genetic evolution of pancreatic cancer. Metastasis, the dissemination and growth of neoplastic cells in an organ distinct from that in which they originated, is the most common cause of death in cancer patients. This is particularly true for pancreatic cancers, where most patients are diagnosed with metastatic disease and few show a sustained response to chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Whether the dismal prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer compared to patients with other types of cancer is a result of late diagnosis or early dissemination of disease to distant organs is not known. Here we rely on data generated by sequencing the genomes of seven pancreatic cancer metastases to evaluate the clonal relationships among primary and metastatic cancers. We find that clonal populations that give rise to distant metastases are represented within the primary carcinoma, but these clones are genetically evolved from the original parental, non-metastatic clone. Thus, genetic heterogeneity of metastases reflects that within the primary carcinoma. A quantitative analysis of the timing of the genetic evolution of pancreatic cancer was performed, indicating at least a decade between the occurrence of the initiating mutation and the birth of the parental, non-metastatic founder cell. At least five more years are required for the acquisition of metastatic ability and patients die an average of two years thereafter. These data provide novel insights into the genetic features underlying pancreatic cancer progression and define a broad time window of opportunity for early detection to prevent deaths from metastatic disease.",cancer"The patterns and dynamics of genomic instability in metastatic pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive malignancy with a five-year mortality of 97-98%, usually due to widespread metastatic disease. Previous studies indicate that this disease has a complex genomic landscape, with frequent copy number changes and point mutations, but genomic rearrangements have not been characterized in detail. Despite the clinical importance of metastasis, there remain fundamental questions about the clonal structures of metastatic tumours, including phylogenetic relationships among metastases, the scale of ongoing parallel evolution in metastatic and primary sites, and how the tumour disseminates. Here we harness advances in DNA sequencing to annotate genomic rearrangements in 13 patients with pancreatic cancer and explore clonal relationships among metastases. We find that pancreatic cancer acquires rearrangements indicative of telomere dysfunction and abnormal cell-cycle control, namely dysregulated G1-to-S-phase transition with intact G2-M checkpoint. These initiate amplification of cancer genes and occur predominantly in early cancer development rather than the later stages of the disease. Genomic instability frequently persists after cancer dissemination, resulting in ongoing, parallel and even convergent evolution among different metastases. We find evidence that there is genetic heterogeneity among metastasis-initiating cells, that seeding metastasis may require driver mutations beyond those required for primary tumours, and that phylogenetic trees across metastases show organ-specific branches. These data attest to the richness of genetic variation in cancer, brought about by the tandem forces of genomic instability and evolutionary selection.",cancer"Promoter polymorphisms in the beta-2 adrenergic receptor are associated with drug-induced gene expression changes and response in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We investigated whether genetic polymorphisms in the promoter region of the proapoptotic beta-2 adrenergic receptor gene (ADRB2) influence treatment-induced changes in ADRB2 expression in leukemia cells and response to chemotherapy. The ADRB2 promoter region was genotyped in germline DNA from 369 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). For 95 of the patients, sufficient RNA was available before and after in vivo treatment to assess treatment-induced gene expression changes in ALL cells. After treatment, the median ADRB2 mRNA expression was ninefold lower in leukemia cells of patients who ultimately relapsed as compared with patients who remained in continuous complete remission (CCR). Polymorphisms in the ADRB2 promoter were significantly linked to methotrexate (MTX)-induced upregulation in ADRB2 gene expression in ALL cells. Moreover, the ADRB2 promoter haplotype was significantly related to early treatment response in 245 children with ALL who received uniform treatment. We conclude that germline polymorphisms in ADRB2 are linked to the antileukemic effects of ALL chemotherapy.",cancer"Endoxifen, a new cornerstone of breast cancer therapy: demonstration of safety, tolerability, and systemic bioavailability in healthy human subjects. Endoxifen is an active metabolite of tamoxifen, a drug used in the treatment of breast cancer. In order to be clinically effective, tamoxifen must be converted to endoxifen by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). A study involving single escalating oral doses was conducted in humans to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of endoxifen. This is the first study demonstrating that single oral doses of endoxifen are safe and well tolerated and have sufficient bioavailability to reach systemically effective levels in human subjects. Furthermore, it was found that endoxifen is rapidly absorbed and systemically available and that it displays dose proportionality in peak drug concentrations in plasma (C(max)) and area under the concentration-time curve extrapolated from 0 to infinity (AUC(0-infinity)) over the dose range 0.5-4.0 mg.",cancer"A phase I study of the pharmacokinetic and safety profiles of oral pazopanib with a high-fat or low-fat meal in patients with advanced solid tumors. Pazopanib is an oral angiogenesis inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and cytokine receptor. This open-label, randomized, crossover, phase I study evaluated the effect of low- and high-fat meals on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of pazopanib in patients with advanced solid tumors. Patients participated in either the lead-in cohort or randomized food-effect cohort. Patients in the lead-in cohort were administered a single dose of pazopanib 400 mg with a high-fat meal. Patients in the food-effect cohort were randomized to receive single doses of pazopanib 800 mg in fed condition (high- or low-fat meal) or fasting condition, in random sequence 14 days apart. After completion of the study, patients were given the opportunity to continue treatment with daily pazopanib 800 mg. Administration of pazopanib with both low- and high-fat meals increased maximum observed plasma concentration (C(max)) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) by approximately twofold as compared with the corresponding values when administered to patients in the fasted condition. Therefore, pazopanib should be administered to patients in the fasted state so as to minimize within- and between-day variability in the systemic exposure to pazopanib in patients with cancer.",cancer"Correlation between imatinib pharmacokinetics and clinical response in Japanese patients with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia. Despite the outstanding results generally obtained with imatinib mesylate (IM) in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), some patients show a poor molecular response. To evaluate the relationship between steady-state trough plasma IM concentration (IM-C(min)) and clinical response in CML patients, we integrated data from six independent Japanese studies. Among 254 CML patients, the mean IM-C(min) was 1,010.5 ng/ml. Importantly, IM-C(min) was significantly higher in patients who achieved a major molecular response (MMR) than in those who did not (P = 0.002). Multivariate analysis showed that an MMR was associated with both age (odds ratio (OR) = 0.97 (0.958-0.995); P = 0.0153) and with IM-C(min) (OR = 1.0008 (1.0003-1.0015); P = 0.0044). Given that patients with IM-C(min) values >1,002 ng/ml had a higher probability of achieving an MMR in our large cohort (P = 0.0120), the data suggest that monitoring of IM levels in plasma may improve the efficacy of IM therapy for CML patients.",cancer"Rye whole grain and bran intake compared with refined wheat decreases urinary C-peptide, plasma insulin, and prostate specific antigen in men with prostate cancer. Rye whole grain and bran intake has shown beneficial effects on prostate cancer progression in animal models, including lower tumor take rates, smaller tumor volumes, and reduced prostate specific antigen (PSA) concentrations. A human pilot study showed increased apoptosis after consumption of rye bran bread. In this study, we investigated the effect of high intake of rye whole grain and bran on prostate cancer progression as assessed by PSA concentration in men diagnosed with prostate cancer. Seventeen participants were provided with 485 g rye whole grain and bran products (RP) or refined wheat products with added cellulose (WP), corresponding to ~50% of daily energy intake, in a randomized controlled, crossover design. Blood samples were taken from fasting men before and after 2, 4, and 6 wk of treatment and 24-h urine samples were collected before the first intervention period and after treatment. Plasma total PSA concentrations were lower after treatment with RP compared with WP, with a mean treatment effect of -14% (P = 0.04). Additionally, fasting plasma insulin and 24-h urinary C-peptide excretion were lower after treatment with RP compared with WP (P < 0.01 and P = 0.01, respectively). Daily excretion of 5 lignans was higher after the RP treatment than after the WP treatment (P < 0.001). We conclude that whole grain and bran from rye resulted in significantly lower plasma PSA compared with a cellulose-supplemented refined wheat diet in patients with prostate cancer. The effect may be related to inhibition of prostate cancer progression caused by decreased exposure to insulin, as indicated by plasma insulin and urinary C-peptide excretion.",cancer"Is soy consumption good or bad for the breast? Genistein in soy activates estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha and ERbeta and acts as an estradiol in multiple target tissues. Because estrogens increase breast cancer risk and genistein promotes the growth of ER-positive human breast cancer cells, it has remained unclear whether this isoflavone or soy is safe. Results reviewed here suggest that women consuming moderate amounts of soy throughout their life have lower breast cancer risk than women who do not consume soy; however, this protective effect may originate from soy intake early in life. We also review the literature regarding potential risks genistein poses for breast cancer survivors. Findings obtained in 2 recent human studies show that a moderate consumption of diet containing this isoflavone does not increase the risk of breast cancer recurrence in Western women, and Asian breast cancer survivors exhibit better prognosis if they continue consuming a soy diet. The mechanisms explaining the breast cancer risk-reducing effect of early soy intake or the protective effect in Asian breast cancer survivors remain to be established. We propose that the reduction in risk involves epigenetic changes that result in alterations in the expression of genes that regulate mammary epithelial cell fate, i.e. cell proliferation and differentiation. Lifetime soy consumption at a moderate level may prevent breast cancer recurrence through mechanisms that change the biology of tumors; e.g. women who consumed soy during childhood develop breast cancers that express significantly reduced Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 levels. More research is needed to understand why soy intake during early life may both reduce breast cancer risk and risk of recurrence.",cancer"Effect of repeated invitations on uptake of colorectal cancer screening using faecal occult blood testing: analysis of prevalence and incidence screening. OBJECTIVE: To analyse the effects of prevalence and incidence screening on uptake and detection of cancer in an ongoing, dynamic programme for colorectal screening using faecal occult blood testing. DESIGN: Analysis of prevalence and incidence screening. SETTING: Three rounds of biennial colorectal screening using the guaiac faecal occult blood test in east and north east Scotland, March 2000 to May 2007. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 50-69. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Uptake of screening, test positivity (percentage of those invited who returned a test that was positive and triggered an invitation for colonoscopy), positive predictive value, and stage of cancer. RESULTS: Of 510 990 screening episodes in all three rounds, 248 998 (48.7%) were for prevalence, 163 483 (32.0%) were for first incidence, and 98 509 (19.3%) were for second incidence. Uptake of a first invitation for prevalence screening was 53% and for a second and third invitation was 15% and 12%. In the cohort invited for the first round, uptake of prevalence screening rose from 55% in the first round to 63% in the third. The uptake of first incidence screening on a first invitation was 54% and on a second invitation was 86% and on a first invitation for second incidence screening was 46%. The positivity rate in prevalence screening was 1.9% and the uptake of colonoscopy was 87%. The corresponding values for a first incidence screen were 1.7% and 90% and for a second incidence screen were 1.1% and 94.5%. The positive predictive value of a positive faecal occult blood test result for cancer was 11.0% for prevalence screening, 6.5% for the first incidence screen, and 7.5% for the second incidence screen. The corresponding values for the positive predictive value for adenoma were 35.5%, 29.4%, and 26.7%. The proportion of cancers at stage I dropped from 46.5% for prevalence screening to 41% for first incidence screening and 35% for second incidence screening. CONCLUSIONS: Repeat invitations to those who do not take up the offer of screening increases the number of those who accept, for both prevalence screening and incidence screening. Although the positive predictive value for both cancer and adenomas fell between the prevalence screen and the first incidence screen, they did not fall between the first and second incidence screens. The deterioration in cancer stage from prevalence to incidence screening suggests that some cancers picked up at incidence screening may have been missed on prevalence screening, but the stage distribution is still favourable. These data vindicate the policies of continuing to offer screening to those who fail to participate and continuing to offer biennial screening to those who have accepted previous offers.",cancer"The neurodevelopmental sequelae of childhood leukaemia and its treatment. The overall survival of childhood leukaemia has increased dramatically over recent decades. With the increasing number of survivors, chemotherapy protocols are designed not only to improve cure rates but also to minimise long-term sequelae. Central-nervous-system-directed therapy given as intrathecal chemotherapy and/or cranial irradiation plays a crucial part in acute leukaemia treatment but can also result in adverse effects on the developing brain. The elimination of cranial irradiation from current treatment protocols has improved the neurocognitive outcome without compromising survival rates. Although neurodevelopmental long-term sequelae after chemotherapy-only central-nervous-system-directed therapies may be more subtle, survivors of childhood leukaemia will continue to require methodical follow-up and appropriate rehabilitation.",cancer"Management of giant hemangioma of the liver: resection versus observation. BACKGROUND: Management of patients with giant hemangiomas of the liver encounters persistent controversy. Although recent case series suggest a low complication rate with nonoperative management, the classic paradigm of preventive operative resection remains. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study was conducted of 492 patients with giant hepatic hemangioma (>4 cm in size) diagnosed between 1985 and 2005 at Mayo Clinic Rochester. Long-term outcomes were assessed by patient survey, with a follow-up of 11 +/- 6.4 years. RESULTS: Of 492 patients, 289 responded to the survey. In the nonoperative group (n = 233), 20% had persistent or new onset of hemangioma-associated symptoms, including potentially life-threatening complications in 2%. In the operative group (n = 56), perioperative complications occurred in 14%, including potentially life-threatening complications in 7%. None of the operative patients had persistent or new onset of hemangioma-associated symptoms after resection of the dominant hemangioma. In group comparison, the rate of adverse events was similar (20% versus 14%; p = 0.45) with an overall low risk for potentially life-threatening complications (2% versus 7%; p = 0.07). Size of hemangiomas was not associated with adverse events in either group. Subjective health status and quality of life at follow-up were similar in both groups (p > 0.54). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical observation of patients with giant hemangioma of the liver has a similar rate of complications compared with operative management, but might prevent the need for invasive interventions in some patients. Clinical observation is preferred in most patients and operative treatment should be reserved for patients with severe symptoms or disease-associated complications.",cancer"Surgical resection for locoregional esophageal cancer is underutilized in the United States. BACKGROUND: Although esophagectomy provides the highest probability of cure in patients with esophageal cancer, many candidates are never referred for surgery. We hypothesized that esophagectomy for esophageal cancer is underused, and we assessed the prevalence of resection in national, state, and local cancer data registries. STUDY DESIGN: Clinical stage, surgical and nonsurgical treatments, age, and race of patients with cancer of the esophagus were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registry (1988 to 2004), the Healthcare Association of NY State registry (HANYS 2007), and a single referral center (2000 to 2007). SEER identified a total of 25,306 patients with esophageal cancer (average age 65.0 years, male-to-female ratio 3:1). HANYS identified 1,012 cases of esophageal cancer (average age 67 years, M:F ratio 3:1); stage was not available from NY State registry data. A single referral center identified 385 patients (48 per year; average age 67 years, M:F 3:1). For SEER data, logistic regression was used to examine determinants of esophageal resection; variables tested included age, race, and gender. RESULTS: Surgical exploration was performed in 29% of the total and only 44.2% of potentially resectable patients. Esophageal resection was performed in 44% of estimated cancer patients in NY State. By comparison, 64% of patients at a specialized referral center underwent surgical exploration, 96% of whom had resection. SEER resection rates for esophageal cancer did not change between 1988 and 2004. Males were more likely to receive operative treatment. Nonwhites were less likely to undergo surgery than whites (odds ratio 0.45, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Surgical therapy for locoregional esophageal cancer is likely underused. Racial variations in esophagectomy are significant. Referral to specialized centers may result in an increase in patients considered for surgical therapy.",cancer"ZEB1-responsive genes in non-small cell lung cancer. The epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a developmental process enabling epithelial cells to gain a migratory mesenchymal phenotype. In cancer, this process contributes to metastases; however the regulatory signals and mechanistic details are not fully elucidated. Here, we sought to identify the subset of genes regulated in lung cancer by ZEB1, an E-box transcriptional repressor known to induce EMT. Using an Affymetrix-based expression database of 38 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, we identified 324 genes that correlated negatively with ZEB1 and 142 that were positively correlated. A mesenchymal gene pattern (low E-cadherin, high Vimentin or N-cadherin) was significantly associated with ZEB1 and ZEB2, but not with Snail, Slug, Twist1 or Twist2. Among eight genes selected for validation, seven were confirmed to correlate with ZEB1 by quantitative real-time RT-PCR in a series of 22 NSCLC cell lines, either negatively (CDS1, EpCAM, ESRP1, ESRP2, ST14) or positively (FGFR1, Vimentin). In addition, over-expression or knockdown of ZEB1 led to corresponding changes in gene expression, demonstrating that these genes are also regulated by ZEB1, either directly or indirectly. Of note, the combined knockdown of ZEB1 and ZEB2 led to apparent synergistic responses in gene expression. Furthermore, these responses were not restricted to artificial settings, since most genes were similarly regulated during a physiologic induction of EMT by TGF-beta plus EGF. Finally, the absence of ST14 (matriptase) was linked to ZEB1 positivity in lung cancer tissue microarrays, implying that the regulation observed in vitro applies to the human disease. In summary, this study identifies a new set of ZEB-regulated genes in human lung cancer cells and supports the hypothesis that ZEB1 and ZEB2 are key regulators of the EMT process in this disease.",cancer"Resolution of mesangial light chain deposits 3 years after high-dose melphalan with autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. A 52-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for treatment of nephrotic syndrome. Funduscopic findings showed fundal hemorrhage and soft exudates, and serologic analysis showed a monoclonal serum component that was identified as Bence Jones protein-k type. A bone marrow biopsy showed diffuse proliferation of atypical plasma cells, while a renal biopsy showed diffuse and nodular mesangial proliferation. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed the presence of k chains along the glomerular basement membrane and in mesangial areas. The patient was diagnosed as multiple myeloma (Bence Jones k type) with light chain deposition disease (LCDD). After high-dose melphalan and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT), the multiple myeloma and nephrotic syndrome were in complete remission; her renal function was improved, but a renal biopsy performed 6 months after PBSCT showed the persistence of diffuse and nodular lesions. By contrast, a renal biopsy performed 3 years later showed complete resolution of the diffuse and nodular mesangial proliferation.",cancer"Chemotherapy-associated recurrent pneumothoraces in lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis is a rare cause of pneumothorax in women. We present the case of a 48-year-old woman with lymphangioleiomyomatosis, who had never had a pneumothorax prior to commencing chemotherapy for breast cancer. During chemotherapy she developed 3 pneumothoraces and 2 episodes of pneumomediastinum. We suggest that the pneumothoraces were caused by the chemotherapy. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of chemotherapy triggering pneumothoraces in a woman with lymphangioleiomyomatosis.",cancer"Radiation dose to patients and clinicians during fluoroscopically-guided biopsy of peripheral pulmonary lesions. BACKGROUND: Fluoroscopic guidance may be utilized in some bronchoscopic procedures, including ultrasound-guided bronchoscopy for investigation of peripheral pulmonary lesions. Some authors have suggested this procedure may be performed without fluoroscopy, to minimize risks due to radiation exposure. However, the radiation dose has never been quantified, so the risk remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine the patient and clinician radiation exposure from fluoroscopy during bronchoscopy. METHODS: We recorded exposure parameters during 45 consecutive ultrasound bronchoscopies with fluoroscopic guidance with a mobile C-arm fluoroscopy system. We calculated the patient effective radiation dose with Monte Carlo computer simulations. Passive personal film dosimeters were placed on 4 sites on both the proceduralist and the primary nursing assistant. RESULTS: The mean fluoroscopy screening time was 96 +/- 55 s. Patients received a median effective radiation dose of 0.49 +/- 0.37 milli-Sieverts (mSv) (range 0.16-1.3 mSv). Only the film dosimeters worn outside the clinicians' protective aprons recorded measurable radiation doses. Based on typical attenuation properties of the protective garments across the diagnostic x-ray energy range, we estimate that the effective radiation dose per procedure to the proceduralist was 0.4 micro-Sieverts (muSv) and to the assistant was 0.2 muSv. CONCLUSIONS: Patients are exposed to relatively small amounts of radiation from fluoroscopy during bronchoscopy. Clinically indicated fluoroscopic guidance during bronchoscopy should not be precluded on the basis of radiation safety concerns. Adequate shielding of clinicians results in negligible radiation doses during ultrasound bronchoscopy.",cancer"EML4-ALK mutations in lung cancer that confer resistance to ALK inhibitors. The EML4 (echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4)-ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) fusion-type tyrosine kinase is an oncoprotein found in 4 to 5% of non-small-cell lung cancers, and clinical trials of specific inhibitors of ALK for the treatment of such tumors are currently under way. Here, we report the discovery of two secondary mutations within the kinase domain of EML4-ALK in tumor cells isolated from a patient during the relapse phase of treatment with an ALK inhibitor. Each mutation developed independently in subclones of the tumor and conferred marked resistance to two different ALK inhibitors.

Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a distinctive mesenchymal neoplasm characterized by a spindle-cell proliferation with an inflammatory infiltrate. Approximately half of IMTs carry rearrangements of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) locus on chromosome 2p23, causing aberrant ALK expression. We report a sustained partial response to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib (PF-02341066, Pfizer) in a patient with ALK-translocated IMT, as compared with no observed activity in another patient without the ALK translocation. These results support the dependence of ALK-rearranged tumors on ALK-mediated signaling and suggest a therapeutic strategy for genomically identified patients with the aggressive form of this soft-tissue tumor. (Funded by Pfizer and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00585195.).",cancer"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibition in non-small-cell lung cancer. BACKGROUND: Oncogenic fusion genes consisting of EML4 and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) are present in a subgroup of non-small-cell lung cancers, representing 2 to 7% of such tumors. We explored the therapeutic efficacy of inhibiting ALK in such tumors in an early-phase clinical trial of crizotinib (PF-02341066), an orally available small-molecule inhibitor of the ALK tyrosine kinase. METHODS: After screening tumor samples from approximately 1500 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer for the presence of ALK rearrangements, we identified 82 patients with advanced ALK-positive disease who were eligible for the clinical trial. Most of the patients had received previous treatment. These patients were enrolled in an expanded cohort study instituted after phase 1 dose escalation had established a recommended crizotinib dose of 250 mg twice daily in 28-day cycles. Patients were assessed for adverse events and response to therapy. RESULTS: Patients with ALK rearrangements tended to be younger than those without the rearrangements, and most of the patients had little or no exposure to tobacco and had adenocarcinomas. At a mean treatment duration of 6.4 months, the overall response rate was 57% (47 of 82 patients, with 46 confirmed partial responses and 1 confirmed complete response); 27 patients (33%) had stable disease. A total of 63 of 82 patients (77%) were continuing to receive crizotinib at the time of data cutoff, and the estimated probability of 6-month progression-free survival was 72%, with no median for the study reached. The drug resulted in grade 1 or 2 (mild) gastrointestinal side effects. CONCLUSIONS: The inhibition of ALK in lung tumors with the ALK rearrangement resulted in tumor shrinkage or stable disease in most patients.

Cancer and its treatment can compromise bone health, leading to fracture, pain, loss of mobility, and hypercalcemia of malignancy. Bone metastasis occurs frequently in advanced prostate and breast cancers, and bony manifestations are commonplace in multiple myeloma. Osteoporosis and osteopenia may be consequences of androgen-deprivation therapy for prostate cancer, aromatase inhibition for breast cancer, or chemotherapy-induced ovarian failure. Osteoporotic bone loss and bone metastasis ultimately share a pathophysiologic pathway that stimulates bone resorption by increasing the formation and activity of osteoclasts. Important mediators of pathologic bone metabolism include substances produced by osteoblasts, such as RANKL, the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand, which spurs osteoclast differentiation from myeloid cells. Available therapies are targeted to various steps in cascade of bone metastasis.",cancer"Sex chromosome changes after sex-mismatched allogeneic bone marrow transplantation can mislead the chimerism analysis. A 12-year-old male with pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia with cryptic BCR/ABL rearrangement underwent sex-mismatched allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT). Contradictory results were provided by various chimerism analyses 3 months later. Y-chromosome-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction and sex chromosome-specific interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (i-FISH) showed complete donor chimerism. Analysis of autosomal short tandem repeats (A-STR), BCR/ABL i-FISH test, and X-STR haplotype indicated relapse. Metaphase-FISH and combined BCR/ABL and sex chromosome-specific i-FISH patterns revealed loss of the Y-chromosome and duplication of the X-chromosome in the host cells. Sex chromosome changes after allo-BMT can cause significant difficulties in chimerism analysis.",cancer"Evaluation of cytarabine against Ewing sarcoma xenografts by the pediatric preclinical testing program. Treatment with the nucleoside analog cytarabine has been shown to mimic changes in gene expression associated with downregulation of the EWS-FLI1 oncogene in Ewing sarcoma cell lines, selectively inhibit their growth in vitro, and cause tumor regression in athymic nude mice. For this report cytarabine was studied in vitro against a panel of 23 pediatric cancer cell lines and in vivo against 6 Ewing sarcoma xenografts. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines were the most sensitive to cytarabine in vitro (median IC(50) 9 nM), while Ewing sarcoma cell lines showed intermediate sensitivity (median IC(50) 232 nM). Cytarabine at a dose of 150 mg/kg administered daily 5x failed to significantly inhibit growth of five xenograft models, but reduced growth rate of the A673 xenograft by 50%. Cytarabine shows no differential in vitro activity against Ewing sarcoma cell lines and is ineffective in vivo against Ewing sarcoma xenografts at the dose and schedule studied.",cancer"Complete response to carboplatin, gemcitabine, and paclitaxel in a patient with advanced metastatic renal medullary carcinoma. Renal medullary carcinoma (RMC) is a rare and aggressive malignancy seen primarily in patients with sickle-cell trait.

We report a rare case of an intrarenal teratoma in a 6-month-old male. Following biopsy, he was successfully managed with a primary nephrectomy. This patient presented as would a Wilms tumor. According to SIOP guidelines, the diagnosis of Wilms tumor is made on clinical and imaging information only, prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This patient was investigated, according to UK (CCLG) guidelines, with a biopsy prior to treatment and therefore avoided unnecessary chemotherapy.",cancer"Anaplastic ependymoma with sclerotic bone metastases. Ependymomas are glial central nervous system (CNS) tumors that arise from the ependymal layer of brain and spinal cord. These are heterogeneous group of tumors with varied histopathological features and prognosis. They frequently relapse at the primary site and may disseminate to other CNS sites. Extraneural metastases are, however, extremely rare. We present a case of ependymoma in a child with widespread metastasis to her bones, a previously unreported event.",cancer"May-Thurner syndrome found incidentally after left femoral catheterization in a pediatric patient. In May-Thurner syndrome, the left common iliac vein is compressed between the overlying right common iliac artery and the underlying vertebral body. Chronic and/or repetitive compressions at this site cause fibrosis of the vein and thus stenosis, potentially occluding the lumen. This report describes a case of May-Thurner syndrome discovered incidentally after femoral catheterization for chemotherapy in a 25-month-old child with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). The patient had no symptoms associated with compression. The syndrome was diagnosed by computed tomography, and there was no evidence of thrombosis. The patient died secondary to sepsis.",cancer"Presumptive treatment for malaria is not justified in children receiving cancer chemotherapy. BACKGROUND: Predominant etiologies of febrile neutropenia (FN) during the course of cancer chemotherapy include infections with bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Infection with malarial parasite is a possibility in regions that are endemic for malaria. Over-diagnosis and over-treatment of malaria is increasingly being recognized as a serious concern in malaria endemic regions. Aim was to determine the incidence of malarial infection in episodes of FN in children receiving chemotherapy for malignant disorders. METHODS: Children, with malignant disorders, on chemotherapy, who fulfilled the definition of FN were enrolled prospectively. Standard microscopy, quantitative buffy coat, and antigen detection (OptiMAL) were performed in each episode of FN. RESULTS: One hundred episodes of FN involving 82 children were investigated. The age ranged from 2 to 13 years (mean: 5.8 +/- 2.8). Eighty-one episodes were in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 15 in acute myeloid leukemia, and remaining 4 in other malignancies. Evidence for malaria was not found in any case by any of the three methods. CONCLUSIONS: Malaria was not found to be a causative agent for FN in children with various malignant disorders, in a region with low endemicity for malaria. Presumptive administration of antimalarials in children with FN is unjustified. Pediatric oncologists constantly face the challenge of managing febrile illnesses in immunocompromised patients. Those practicing in malaria endemic regions can effectively exploit diagnostic tools for malaria for a rational decision.",cancer"Optic pathway glioma: long-term visual outcome in children without neurofibromatosis type-1. BACKGROUND: Little is known about the visual outcome of children affected by an optic pathway glioma (OPG). PROCEDURES: We evaluated the long-term visual outcome of 32 consecutive children affected by OPG without neurofibromatosis type-1 referred to the Pediatric Department of Padua University and managed according to standardized strategies. RESULTS: Eight children received chemotherapy, 10 radiotherapy, 7 both chemotherapy and radiotherapy, whereas 7 were untreated. At presentation, visual acuity (VA) was normal in 22 children (13 unilaterally and 9 bilaterally), and reduced in 10. At follow-up, VA had improved in 6 patients; it was stable in 8 and worse in 18. Visual field, assessed in 29 children, was normal in 9 and reduced in 20. The number of children with some grade of visual impairment increased from 7 to 10 during follow-up. Of the 17 children in whom the tumor became significantly smaller, VA improved in 6, was stable in 3, and worse in 8. Of the 6 children with improved VA, 5 received radiotherapy, and their papilla was normal or mildly pale. After a median follow-up of 6 years, 26 patients are alive with stable disease. CONCLUSIONS: The visual prognosis of children with OPG is unsatisfactory. Older children treated with radiotherapy seem to have a better visual outcome than younger children. Severe optic pallor at diagnosis or during follow-up may be indicative of a negative prognosis.",cancer"PET imaging for pediatric oncology: an assessment of the evidence. Positron emission tomography (PET) has shown potential benefits when used in therapeutic clinical trials for children with cancer. However, existing trials are limited in scope with small numbers of patients and varied observations, making accurate conclusions about the usefulness of PET scanning impossible. This review examines PET and its applications in pediatric oncology. While evidence is limited, there appears to be a basis for rigorous evaluation of this imaging modality before widespread application without validation from clinical trials.",cancer"Expanding options to improve outcomes following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) offers a curative option for children with a number of potentially lethal malignant and non-malignant conditions. Decisions regarding the appropriateness of HSCT for a given patient involve careful consideration of the risks associated with HSCT and the likelihood of cure. This is particularly important as the procedure is being used with increasing frequency for diagnoses such as high-risk sickle cell anemia where the disease is associated with shortened lifespan but death generally occurs in adulthood. Recent advances in supportive care such as improved anti-microbial agents, the use of reduced intensity conditioning regimens and high-resolution HLA typing that allows for better donor selection have all contributed to improved outcomes. However, the risk of treatment-related mortality remains approximately 5-10%, in part due to complications such as veno-occlusive disease (VOD) for which there has been less progress.",cancer"Clinical features, molecular diagnosis, and treatment outcome of infants with leukemia in Taiwan. BACKGROUND: Infant leukemia is rare and quite distinct from other childhood leukemias. Differentiating between leukemia and transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD) in phenotypically normal infants is sometimes difficult. The clinical features and molecular analyses for the fusion transcripts of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene rearrangement in infant leukemia have not been well documented in the Chinese population. PROCEDURE: Forty-five consecutive infants diagnosed with leukemia between 1995 and 2007 in a tertiary medical center in Taiwan were studied. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was diagnosed in 23 infants, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in 21 (including TMD in 4), and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) in 1. RESULTS: The median white count at diagnosis was higher in ALL than in AML (154.4 x 10(9)/l vs. 58.3 x 10(9)/l, P = 0.05). Chromosome 11q23/MLL abnormalities were present in 77% of ALL and 31% of AML. The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) in infant ALL and AML showed no difference (18% vs. 12%, respectively). The only independent predictor of an adverse prognosis among infants diagnosed with ALL was high presenting white count >/= 100 x 10(9)/l (P = 0.05). However, no factor was associated with an adverse outcome for infants with AML. CONCLUSIONS: The molecular assessments and prognostic factors of infant leukemia in Taiwan mirror those in developed Western countries. Continued molecular investigations and development of more effective therapies are needed.",cancer"Quality management and accreditation of research tissue banks: experience of the National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) Heidelberg. Tissue banks are key resource and technology platforms in biomedical research that address the molecular pathogenesis of diseases as well as disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Due to the central role of tissue banks in standardized collection, storage, and distribution of human tissues and their derivatives, quality management and its external assessment is becoming increasingly relevant for the maintenance, acceptance, and funding of tissue banks. Little experience exists regarding formalized external evaluation of tissue banks, especially regarding certification and accreditation. Based on the accreditation of the National Center of Tumor Diseases (NCT) tissue bank in Heidelberg (Germany), criteria, requirements, processes, and implications were compiled and evaluated. Accreditation formally approved professional competence and performance of the tissue bank in all steps involved in tissue collection, storage, handling as well as macroscopic and histologic examination and final (exit) examination of the tissue and transfer supervised by board-certified competent histopathologists. Thereby, accreditation provides a comprehensive measure to evaluate and document the quality standard of tissue research banks and may play a significant role in the future assessment of tissue banks. Furthermore, accreditation may support harmonization and standardization of tissue banking for biomedical research purposes.",cancer"Pancreatic neuroma-like lesions after upper abdominal surgery: a clinicopathological postmortem study. To elucidate poorly understood pancreatic neural changes after upper abdominal surgery (UAS), we histologically examined 57 postmortem pancreases after gastrectomy, esophagectomy, and esophageal transection, and also investigated each clinical manifestation. Six pancreases (10.5%) had unique histopathological lesions composed of prominently thickened and/or proliferated neural fascicles. They focally or multifocally involved the pancreatic lobules and/or interlobular septa and mimicked traumatic neuroma. Three of the six lesions were accompanied by moderate to severe chronic pancreatitis/pancreatic fibrosis. All six patients were asymptomatic, although only one exhibited a low-echoic pancreatic mass. There were no statistically significant associations between the pancreatic neural lesions and the patients' sex, age, the time interval between the surgery and the patients' death, impaired glucose tolerance, the presence of hyalinized pancreatic islets, or the presence of moderate to severe chronic pancreatitis/pancreatic fibrosis. No similar prominent neural lesions were identified in an additional 57 age- and sex-matched control pancreases. We concluded that these prominent neural lesions were pancreatic neuroma-like lesions following UAS. This study failed to demonstrate the distinct pathogenesis of the neuroma-like lesions and further investigation may be needed. However, this report is the first to delineate that asymptomatic neuroma-like lesions can occur following UAS. Consideration of this possible development would be useful for accurate follow-up of patients who undergo UAS, although its occurrence may be infrequent.",cancer"A systematic review and meta-analysis of the relationship between body size and testicular cancer. BACKGROUND: Studies assessing the relationships of anthropometry and testicular germ-cell tumour (TGCT) have reported heterogeneous findings. METHODS: We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of the associations between adult height, weight, body mass index (BMI), and testicular cancer. Search strategies were conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science on 26 May 2009. Studies that met our inclusion criteria were included in meta-analytic models using STATA 11. RESULTS: A total of 3255 references were retrieved, of which 14 met the inclusion criteria. Random effects meta-analysis found adult height (odds ratio (OR) per 5-cm increase 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-1.19, P<0.001) and weight (OR overweight vs normal 0.92, 95% CI 0.86-0.98, P=0.011) to be associated with TGCT. The meta-analysis of weight and TGCT produced a summary estimate, which indicated no association, although an analysis restricted studies to North American was suggestive of association (OR per 1-kg increase 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.01, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis has found evidence for a positive association of adult height and TGCT, and tentative evidence for an inverse association of BMI and TGCT.",cancer"Pathological complete response and survival according to the level of HER-2 amplification after trastuzumab-based neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer. BACKGROUND: We analysed whether the level of human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) amplification significantly influenced either pathological complete response (pCR) or recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) after trastuzumab-based neoadjuvant therapy. METHODS: In all, 99 patients with an HER-2-amplified breast tumour treated with trastuzumab-based neoadjuvant therapy were included. Tumours were classified as low amplified (LA; 6-10 signals per nuclei) or highly amplified (HA; >10 signals). Pathological response was assessed according to Chevallier's classification (pCR was defined as grade 1 or 2). Median follow-up lasted 46 months (6-83). Cox uni- and multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS: In all, 33 tumour samples were LA and 66 were HA. The pCR in HA tumours was significantly higher than in LA tumours (55% vs 24%, P=0.005), whereas no association was found between the pCR rate and tumour stage, grade or hormone receptor status. In multivariate analysis, the pathological nodal status (P=0.005) and adjuvant trastuzumab (P=0.037) were independently associated with RFS, whereas the level of HER-2 amplification nearly reached statistical significance (P=0.057). There was no significant difference between LA and HA tumours for OS (P=0.22, log-rank). CONCLUSION: The level of HER-2 gene amplification significantly influenced pCR but not RFS or OS in non-metastatic breast cancer treated with trastuzumab-based neoadjuvant therapy. However, RFS in patients with HA tumours tended to be shorter.",cancer"Maternal vitamin and iron supplementation and risk of infant leukaemia: a report from the Children's Oncology Group. BACKGROUND: Prenatal supplementation has been inversely associated with childhood, but not with infant, leukaemia. METHODS: Mothers of 443 cases of infant leukaemia diagnosed during 1996-2006 and 324 frequency-matched controls completed interviews. Associations were evaluated by unconditional logistic regression. RESULTS: We observed no associations between prenatal vitamin (odds ratio (OR)=0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.44-1.42) or iron supplementation (OR=1.07, 95% CI: 0.75-1.52) and infant leukaemia after adjustment for race/ethnicity and income. Similar results were observed for leukaemia subtypes analysed separately. CONCLUSION: The observed null associations may be attributable to high supplementation rates and/or national fortification programmes.",cancer"A 50% higher prevalence of life-shortening chronic conditions among cancer patients with low socioeconomic status. BACKGROUND: Comorbidity and socioeconomic status (SES) may be related among cancer patients. METHOD: Population-based cancer registry study among 72,153 patients diagnosed during 1997-2006. RESULTS: Low SES patients had 50% higher risk of serious comorbidity than those with high SES. Prevalence was increased for each cancer site. Low SES cancer patients had significantly higher risk of also having cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular disease, tuberculosis, dementia, and gastrointestinal disease. One-year survival was significantly worse in lowest vs highest SES, partly explained by comorbidity. CONCLUSION: This illustrates the enormous heterogeneity of cancer patients and stresses the need for optimal treatment of cancer patients with a variety of concomitant chronic conditions.",cancer"Inhibition of renin-angiotensin system affects prognosis of advanced pancreatic cancer receiving gemcitabine. BACKGROUND: The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is thought to have a role in carcinogenesis, and RAS inhibition may prevent tumour growth. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the impact of angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II type-1 receptor blockers (ARBs) in 155 patients with pancreatic cancer receiving gemcitabine monotherapy. Patients were divided into three groups: the ACEI/ARB group (27 patients receiving an ACEI or ARB for hypertension (HT)), the non-ACEI/ARB with HT group (25 patients receiving antihypertensive drugs other than ACEIs or ARBs), and the non-HT group (103 patients receiving no antihypertensive drugs). RESULTS: Patient characteristics were not different, except for age and HT medications. Progression-free survival (PFS) was 8.7 months in the ACEI/ARB group, 4.5 months in the non-ACEI/ARB with HT group, and 3.6 months in the non-HT group. Overall survival (OS) was 15.1 months in the ACEI/ARB group, 8.9 months in the non-ACEI/ARB with HT group, and 9.5 months in the non-HT group. The use of ACEIs/ARBs was a significant prognostic factor for both PFS (P=0.032) and OS (P=0.014) in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The ACEIs/ARBs in combination with gemcitabine might improve clinical outcomes in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Prospective trials are needed to test this hypothesis.",cancer"Increased NOS2 predicts poor survival in estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer patients. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) is involved in wound healing, angiogenesis, and carcinogenesis. NOS2 upregulation and increased nitric oxide (NO) production affect the redox state of cells and can induce protein, lipid, and DNA modifications. To investigate whether NOS2 levels influence survival of breast cancer patients, we examined NOS2 expression and its association with tumor markers and survival in 248 breast tumors. In multivariable survival analysis, increased NOS2 predicted inferior survival in women with estrogen receptor alpha-negative (ER-negative) tumors. Microdissected tumor epithelium from ER-negative tumors with high NOS2 had increased IL-8 and a gene expression signature characteristic of basal-like breast cancer with poor prognosis. In cell culture, NO only induced selected signature genes in ER-negative breast cancer cells. ER transgene expression in ER-negative cells inhibited NO-induced upregulation of the stem cell marker CD44 and other proteins encoded by signature genes, but not of IL-8. Exposure to NO also enhanced cell motility and invasion of ER-negative cells. Last, pathway analysis linked the tumor NOS2 gene signature to c-Myc activation. Thus, NOS2 is associated with a basal-like transcription pattern and poor survival of ER-negative patients.",cancer"The cyclin E regulator cullin 3 prevents mouse hepatic progenitor cells from becoming tumor-initiating cells. Cyclin E is often overexpressed in cancer tissue, leading to genetic instability and aneuploidy. Cullin 3 (Cul3) is a component of the BTB-Cul3-Rbx1 (BCR) ubiquitin ligase that is involved in the turnover of cyclin E. Here we show that liver-specific ablation of Cul3 in mice results in the persistence and massive expansion of hepatic progenitor cells. Upon induction of differentiation, Cul3-deficient progenitor cells underwent substantial DNA damage in vivo and in vitro, thereby triggering the activation of a cellular senescence response that selectively blocked the expansion of the differentiated offspring. Positive selection of undifferentiated progenitor cells required the expression of the tumor suppressor protein p53. Simultaneous loss of Cul3 and p53 in hepatic progenitors turned these cells into highly malignant tumor-initiating cells that formed largely undifferentiated tumors in nude mice. In addition, loss of Cul3 and p53 led to the formation of primary hepatocellular carcinomas. Importantly, loss of Cul3 expression was also detected in a large series of human liver cancers and correlated directly with tumor de-differentiation. The expression of Cul3 during hepatic differentiation therefore safeguards against the formation of progenitor cells that carry a great potential for transformation into tumor-initiating cells.",cancer"Gene therapy using genetically modified lymphocytes targeting VEGFR-2 inhibits the growth of vascularized syngenic tumors in mice. Immunotherapies based on adoptive cell transfer are highly effective in the treatment of metastatic melanoma, but the use of this approach in other cancer histologies has been hampered by the identification of appropriate target molecules. Immunologic approaches targeting tumor vasculature provide a means for the therapy of multiple solid tumor types. We developed a method to target tumor vasculature, using genetically redirected syngeneic or autologous T cells. Mouse and human T cells were engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeted against VEGFR-2, which is overexpressed in tumor vasculature and is responsible for VEGF-mediated tumor progression and metastasis. Mouse and human T cells expressing the relevant VEGFR-2 CARs mediated specific immune responses against VEGFR-2 protein as well as VEGFR-2-expressing cells in vitro. A single dose of VEGFR-2 CAR-engineered mouse T cells plus exogenous IL-2 significantly inhibited the growth of 5 different types of established, vascularized syngeneic tumors in 2 different strains of mice and prolonged the survival of mice. T cells transduced with VEGFR-2 CAR showed durable and increased tumor infiltration, correlating with their antitumor effect. This approach provides a potential method for the gene therapy of a variety of human cancers.",cancer"The cytomegalovirus-encoded chemokine receptor US28 promotes intestinal neoplasia in transgenic mice. US28 is a constitutively active chemokine receptor encoded by CMV (also referred to as human herpesvirus 5), a highly prevalent human virus that infects a broad spectrum of cells, including intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). To study the role of US28 in vivo, we created transgenic mice (VS28 mice) in which US28 expression was targeted to IECs. Expression of US28 was detected in all IECs of the small and large intestine, including in cells expressing leucine rich repeat containing GPCR5 (Lgr5), a marker gene of intestinal epithelial stem cells. US28 expression in IECs inhibited glycogen synthase 3beta (GSK-3beta) function, promoted accumulation of beta-catenin protein, and increased expression of Wnt target genes involved in the control of the cell proliferation. VS28 mice showed a hyperplastic intestinal epithelium and, strikingly, developed adenomas and adenocarcinomas by 40 weeks of age. When exposed to an inflammation-driven tumor model (azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate), VS28 mice developed a significantly higher tumor burden than control littermates. Transgenic coexpression of the US28 ligand CCL2 (an inflammatory chemokine) increased IEC proliferation as well as tumor burden, suggesting that the oncogenic activity of US28 can be modulated by inflammatory factors. Together, these results indicate that expression of US28 promotes development of intestinal dysplasia and cancer in transgenic mice and suggest that CMV infection may facilitate development of intestinal neoplasia in humans.",cancer"Association of KRAS p.G13D mutation with outcome in patients with chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab. CONTEXT: Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have KRAS codon 12- or KRAS codon 13-mutated tumors are presently excluded from treatment with the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody cetuximab. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that KRAS codon 13 mutations are associated with a better outcome after treatment with cetuximab than observed with other KRAS mutations. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: We studied the association between KRAS mutation status (p.G13D vs other KRAS mutations) and response and survival in a pooled data set of 579 patients with chemotherapy-refractory colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab between 2001 and 2008. Patients were included in the CO.17, BOND, MABEL, EMR202600, EVEREST, BABEL, or SALVAGE clinical trials or received off-study treatment. Univariate and multivariate analyses, adjusting for possible prognostic factors and data set, were performed. The effect of the different mutations was studied in vitro by constructing isogenic cell lines with wild-type KRAS, p.G12V, or p.G13D mutant alleles and treating them with cetuximab. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main efficacy end point was overall survival. Secondary efficacy end points were response rate and progression-free survival. RESULTS: In comparison with patients with other KRAS-mutated tumors, patients with p.G13D-mutated tumors (n = 32) treated with cetuximab had longer overall survival (median, 7.6 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 5.7-20.5] months vs 5.7 [95% CI, 4.9-6.8] months; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.50; 95% CI, 0.31-0.81; P = .005) and longer progression-free survival (median, 4.0 [95% CI, 1.9-6.2] months vs 1.9 [95% CI, 1.8-2.8] months; adjusted HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.32-0.81; P = .004). There was a significant interaction between KRAS mutation status (p.G13D vs other KRAS mutations) and overall survival benefit with cetuximab treatment (adjusted HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.14-0.67; P = .003). In vitro and mouse model analysis showed that although p.G12V-mutated colorectal cells were insensitive to cetuximab, p.G13D-mutated cells were sensitive, as were KRAS wild-type cells. CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis, use of cetuximab was associated with longer overall and progression-free survival among patients with chemotherapy-refractory colorectal cancer with p.G13D-mutated tumors than with other KRAS-mutated tumors. Evaluation of cetuximab therapy in these tumors in prospective randomized trials may be warranted.",cancer"In vivo imaging of inflammation- and tumor-induced lymph node lymphangiogenesis by immuno-positron emission tomography. Metastasis to regional lymph nodes (LN) is a prognostic indicator for cancer progression. There is a great demand for sensitive and noninvasive methods to detect metastasis to LNs. Whereas conventional in vivo imaging approaches have focused on the detection of cancer cells, lymphangiogenesis within tumor-draining LNs might be the earliest sign of metastasis. In mouse models of LN lymphangiogenesis, we found that systemically injected antibodies to lymphatic epitopes accumulated in the lymphatic vasculature in tissues and LNs. Using a (124)I-labeled antibody against the lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor-1 (LYVE-1), we imaged, for the first time, inflammation- and tumor-draining LNs with expanded lymphatic networks in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET). Anti-LYVE-1 immuno-PET enabled visualization of lymphatic vessel expansion in LNs bearing metastases that were not detected by [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, which is clinically applied to detect cancer metastases. Immuno-PET with lymphatic-specific antibodies may open up new avenues for the early detection of metastasis, and the images obtained might be used as biomarkers for the progression of diseases associated with lymphangiogenesis.",cancer"EGFR promotes lung tumorigenesis by activating miR-7 through a Ras/ERK/Myc pathway that targets the Ets2 transcriptional repressor ERF. MicroRNAs (miRNA) mediate distinct gene regulatory pathways triggered by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation, which occurs commonly in lung cancers with poor prognosis. In this study, we report the discovery and mechanistic characterization of the miRNA miR-7 as an oncogenic ""oncomiR"" and its role as a key mediator of EGFR signaling in lung cancer cells. EGFR activation or ectopic expression of Ras as well as c-Myc stimulated miR-7 expression in an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent manner, suggesting that EGFR induces miR-7 expression through a Ras/ERK/Myc pathway. In support of this likelihood, c-Myc bound to the miR-7 promoter and enhanced its activity. Ectopic miR-7 promoted cell growth and tumor formation in lung cancer cells, significantly increasing the mortality of nude mice hosts, which were orthotopically implanted with lung cancers. Quantitative proteomic analysis revealed that miR-7 decreased levels of the Ets2 transcriptional repression factor ERF, the coding sequence of which was found to contain a miR-7 complementary sequence. Indeed, ectopic miR-7 inhibited production of ERF messages with a wild-type but not a silently mutated coding sequence, and ectopic miR-7 rescued growth arrest produced by wild-type but not mutated ERF. Together, these results identified that ERF is a direct target of miR-7 in lung cancer. Our findings suggest that miR-7 may act as an important modulator of EGFR-mediated oncogenesis, with potential applications as a novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in lung cancer.",cancer"Heparanase enhances local and systemic osteolysis in multiple myeloma by upregulating the expression and secretion of RANKL. Excessive bone destruction is a major cause of morbidity in myeloma patients. However, the biological mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of myeloma-induced bone disease are not fully understood. Heparanase, an enzyme that cleaves the heparan sulfate chains of proteoglycans, is upregulated in a variety of human tumors, including multiple myeloma. We previously showed that heparanase promotes robust myeloma tumor growth and supports spontaneous metastasis of tumor cells to bone. In the present study, we show, for the first time, that the expression of heparanase by myeloma tumor cells remarkably enhances bone destruction locally within the tumor microenvironment. In addition, enhanced heparanase expression in the primary tumor also stimulated systemic osteoclastogenesis and osteolysis, thus mimicking the systemic osteoporosis often seen in myeloma patients. These effects occur, at least in part, as the result of a significant elevation in the expression and secretion of receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) by heparanase-expressing myeloma cells. Moreover, analysis of bone marrow biopsies from myeloma patients reveals a positive correlation between the level of expression of heparanase and RANKL. Together, these discoveries reveal a novel and key role for heparanase in promoting tumor osteolysis and show that RANKL is central to the mechanism of heparanase-mediated osteolysis in myeloma.",cancer"Nuclear receptor COUP-TFII controls pancreatic islet tumor angiogenesis by regulating vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 signaling. The significance of angiogenesis in cancer biology and therapy is well established. In this study, we used the prototypical RIP-Tag model of multistage pancreatic islet tumorigenesis to show that the nuclear receptor COUP-TFII is essential to regulate the balance between pro- and anti-angiogenic molecules that influence the angiogenic switch in cancer. Conditional ablation of COUP-TFII in the tumor microenvironment severely compromised neoangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis during pancreatic tumor progression and metastasis. We found that COUP-TFII plays a cell-autonomous role in endothelial cells to control blood vessel sprouting by regulating cell proliferation and migration. Mechanistic investigations revealed that COUP-TFII suppressed vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) signaling by transcriptionally repressing the expression of VEGFR-1, thereby curtailing a central angiogenic driver of vascular growth. Taken together, our results implicate COUP-TFII as a critical factor in tumor angiogenesis through regulation of VEGF/VEGFR-2 signaling, suggesting COUP-TFII as a candidate target for antiangiogenic therapy.",cancer"A major role of p95/611-CTF, a carboxy-terminal fragment of HER2, in the down-modulation of the estrogen receptor in HER2-positive breast cancers. Current classification of breast cancers depends in great part on the expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), a cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor, and estrogen receptor (ER), the nuclear receptor for estrogen. In addition to reliable biomarkers, these receptors are targets of effective and widely used antitumor drugs. During malignant progression, HER2 and ER can establish an intricate cross-talk. In some cases, HER2 overexpression leads to the downregulation of ER and undermining of anti-ER therapies. A subgroup of HER2-positive breast cancer patients with poor prognosis expresses a heterogeneous collection of HER2 carboxy-terminal fragments (CTF) collectively known as p95HER2. One of these fragments, 611-CTF, is oncogenic in a variety of preclinical models. However, because of the lack of an appropriate tool to specifically analyze its levels in the clinical setting, the value of 611-CTF as a biomarker has not been established yet. Here, we show that 611-CTF induces resistance to antiestrogen therapy and a more pronounced down-modulation of ER than that induced by full-length HER2. To validate this effect in breast cancer samples, we developed specific anti-611-CTF antibodies. With these antibodies, we showed that, whereas the frequency of ER positivity in HER2-positive/611-CTF-negative tumors (72.6%) is similar to that reported for HER2-negative tumors (70-80%), the number of ER-positive tumors in the 611-CTF-positive subgroup is very low (31.2%). These results reveal a mechanism of ER regulation mediated by HER2, which suggests a new strategy to improve responses to endocrine therapy in breast cancer.",cancer"Differential effects of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 inhibition on tumor metastases based on host organ environment. Tumors induce new blood vessel growth primarily from host organ microvascular endothelial cells (EC), and microvasculature differs significantly between the lung and liver. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF or VEGF-A) promotion of tumor angiogenesis is thought to be mediated primarily by VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2). In this study, VEGFR-2 antibody (DC101) inhibited growth of RenCa renal cell carcinoma lung metastases by 26%, whereas VEGFR-1 antibody (MF-1) had no effect. However, VEGFR-2 neutralization had no effect on RenCa liver metastases, whereas VEGFR-1 neutralization decreased RenCa liver metastases by 31%. For CT26 colon carcinoma liver metastases, inhibition of both VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 was required to induce growth delay. VEGFR-1 or VEGFR-2 inhibition decreased tumor burden not by preventing the establishment of micrometastases but rather by preventing vascularization and growth of micrometastases by 55% and 43%, respectively. VEGF induced greater phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 in lung ECs and of VEGFR-1 in liver ECs. EC proliferation, migration, and capillary tube formation in vitro were suppressed more by VEGFR-2 inhibition for lung EC and more by VEGFR-1 inhibition for liver EC. Collectively, our results indicate that liver metastases are more reliant on VEGFR-1 than lung metastases to mediate angiogenesis due to differential activity of VEGFRs on liver EC versus lung EC. Thus, therapies inhibiting specific VEGFRs should consider the targeted sites of metastatic disease.",cancer"Targeted radiosensitization of cells expressing truncated DNA polymerase {beta}. Ionizing radiation (IR) is an effective anticancer treatment, although failures still occur. To improve radiotherapy, tumor-targeted strategies are needed to increase radiosensitivity of tumor cells, without influencing normal tissue radiosensitivity. Base excision repair (BER) and single-strand break repair (SSBR) contribute to the determination of sensitivity to IR. A crucial protein in BER/SSBR is DNA polymerase beta (polbeta). Aberrant polbeta expression is commonly found in human tumors and leads to inhibition of BER. Here, we show that truncated polbeta variant (polbeta-Delta)-expressing cells depend on homologous recombination (HR) for survival after IR, indicating that a considerable fraction of polbeta-Delta-induced lesions are subject to repair by HR. Increased sensitization was found not to result from involvement in DNA-dependent protein kinase-dependent nonhomologous end joining, the other major double-strand break repair pathway. Caffeine and the ATM inhibitor Ku55933 cause polbeta-Delta-dependent radiosensitization. Consistent with the observed HR dependence and the known HR-modulating activity of ATM, polbeta-Delta-expressing cells showed increased radiosensitization after BRCA2 knockdown that is absent under ATM-inhibited conditions. Our data suggest that treatment with HR modulators is a promising therapeutic strategy for exploiting defects in the BER/SSBR pathway in human tumors.",cancer"Characterization of a candidate tumor suppressor gene uroplakin 1A in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is increasing in incidence, but the knowledge of the genetic underpinnings of this disease remains limited. In this study, we identified the tetraspanin cell surface receptor uroplakin 1A (UPK1A) as a candidate tumor suppressor gene (TSG), and we investigated its function and mechanism in ESCC cells. UPK1A downregulation occurred in 68% of primary ESCCs examined, where it was correlated significantly with promoter hypermethylation (P < 0.05). Ectopic expression of UPK1A in ESCC cells inhibited cell proliferation, clonogenicity, cell motility, and tumor formation in nude mice. Mechanistic investigations suggested that these effects may be mediated by inhibiting nuclear translocation of beta-catenin and inactivation of its downstream targets, including cyclin-D1, c-jun, c-myc, and matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7). Cell cycle arrest elicited by UPK1A at the G(1)-S checkpoint was associated with downregulation of cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4, whereas metastasis suppression was associated with reduction of MMP7. These findings were consistent with evidence derived from clinical samples, where UPK1A downregulation was correlated with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.009), stage (P = 0.015), and overall survival (P < 0.0001). Indeed, multivariate cyclooxygenase regression analysis showed that UPK1A was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival. Taken together, our findings define a function for UPK1A as an important TSG in ESCC development.",cancer"MicroRNA expression and clinical outcomes in patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy after complete resection of non-small cell lung carcinoma. This study determined whether expression levels of a panel of biologically relevant microRNAs can be used as prognostic or predictive biomarkers in patients who participated in the International Adjuvant Lung Cancer Trial (IALT), the largest randomized study conducted to date of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with radically resected non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Expression of miR-21, miR-29b, miR-34a/b/c, miR-155, and let-7a was determined by quantitative real-time PCR in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor specimens from 639 IALT patients. The prognostic and predictive values of microRNA expression for survival were studied using a Cox model, which included every factor used in the stratified randomization, clinicopathologic prognostic factors, and other factors statistically related to microRNA expression. Investigation of the expression pattern of microRNAs in situ was performed. We also analyzed the association of TP53 mutation status and miR-34a/b/c expression, epidermal growth factor receptor and KRAS mutation status, and miR-21 and Let-7a expression. Finally, the association of p16 and miR-29b expression was assessed. Overall, no significant association was found between any of the tested microRNAs and survival, with the exception of miR-21 for which a deleterious prognostic effect of lowered expression was suggested. Otherwise, no single or combinatorial microRNA expression profile predicted response to adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Together, our results indicate that the microRNA expression patterns examined were neither predictive nor prognostic in a large patient cohort with radically resected NSCLC, randomized to receive adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy versus follow-up only.",cancer"Association of adherence to lifestyle recommendations and risk of colorectal cancer: a prospective Danish cohort study. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association between a simple lifestyle index based on the recommendations for five lifestyle factors and the incidence of colorectal cancer, and to estimate the proportion of colorectal cancer cases attributable to lack of adherence to the recommendations. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: General population of Copenhagen and Aarhus, Denmark. PARTICIPANTS: 55 487 men and women aged 50-64 years at baseline (1993-7), not previously diagnosed with cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Risk of colorectal cancer in relation to points achieved in the lifestyle index (based on physical activity, waist circumference, smoking, alcohol intake, and diet (dietary fibre, energy percentage from fat, red and processed meat, and fruits and vegetables)) modelled through Cox regression. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 9.9 years, 678 men and women had colorectal cancer diagnosed. After adjustment for potential confounders, each additional point achieved on the lifestyle index, corresponding to one additional recommendation that was met, was associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer (incidence rate ratio 0.89 (95% confidence interval 0.82 to 0.96). In this population an estimated total of 13% (95% CI 4% to 22%) of the colorectal cancer cases were attributable to lack of adherence to merely one additional recommendation among all participants except the healthiest. If all participants had followed the five recommendations 23% (9% to 37%) of the colorectal cancer cases might have been prevented. Results were similar for colon and rectal cancer, but only statistically significant for colon cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to the recommendations for physical activity, waist circumference, smoking, alcohol intake, and diet may reduce colorectal cancer risk considerably, and in this population 23% of the cases might be attributable to lack of adherence to the five lifestyle recommendations. The simple structure of the lifestyle index facilitates its use in public health practice.",cancer"A decision aid to support informed choices about bowel cancer screening among adults with low education: randomised controlled trial. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a decision aid designed for adults with low education and literacy can support informed choice and involvement in decisions about screening for bowel cancer. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Areas in New South Wales, Australia identified as socioeconomically disadvantaged (low education attainment, high unemployment, and unskilled occupations). PARTICIPANTS: 572 adults aged between 55 and 64 with low educational attainment, eligible for bowel cancer screening. INTERVENTION: Patient decision aid comprising a paper based interactive booklet (with and without a question prompt list) and a DVD, presenting quantitative risk information on the possible outcomes of screening using faecal occult blood testing compared with no testing. The control group received standard information developed for the Australian national bowel screening programme. All materials and a faecal occult blood test kit were posted directly to people's homes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Informed choice (adequate knowledge and consistency between attitudes and screening behaviour) and preferences for involvement in screening decisions. RESULTS: Participants who received the decision aid showed higher levels of knowledge than the controls; the mean score (maximum score 12) for the decision aid group was 6.50 (95% confidence interval 6.15 to 6.84) and for the control group was 4.10 (3.85 to 4.36; P<0.001). Attitudes towards screening were less positive in the decision aid group, with 51% of the participants expressing favourable attitudes compared with 65% of participants in the control group (14% difference, 95% confidence interval 5% to 23%; P=0.002). The participation rate for screening was reduced in the decision aid group: completion of faecal occult blood testing was 59% v 75% in the control group (16% difference, 8% to 24%; P=0.001). The decision aid increased the proportion of participants who made an informed choice, from 12% in the control group to 34% in the decision aid group (22% difference, 15% to 29%; P<0.001). More participants in the decision aid group had no decisional conflict about the screening decision compared with the controls (51% v 38%; P=0.02). The groups did not differ for general anxiety or worry about bowel cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Tailored decision support information can be effective in supporting informed choices and greater involvement in decisions about faecal occult blood testing among adults with low levels of education, without increasing anxiety or worry about developing bowel cancer. Using a decision aid to make an informed choice may, however, lead to lower uptake of screening.

Delivered on 29 June 2010 at the 35th FEBS Congress in Gothenburg, Sweden. Phosphorylated derivatives of the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), known as phosphoinositides (PIs), regulate membrane-proximal cellular processes by recruiting specific protein effectors involved in cell signalling, membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal dynamics. Two PIs that are generated through the activities of distinct PI 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are of special interest in cancer research. PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3), generated by class I PI3Ks, functions as tumour promotor by recruiting effectors involved in cell survival, proliferation, growth and motility. Conversely, there is evidence that PtdIns3P, generated by class III PI3K, functions in tumour suppression. Three subunits of the class III PI3K complex (Beclin 1, UVRAG and BIF-1) have been independently identified as tumour suppressors in mice and humans, and their mechanism of action in this context has been proposed to entail activation of autophagy, a catabolic pathway that is considered to mediate tumour suppression by scavenging damaged organelles that would otherwise cause DNA instability through the production of reactive oxygen species. Recent studies have revealed two additional functions of PtdIns3P that might contribute to its tumour suppressor activity. The first involves endosomal sorting and lysosomal downregulation of mitogenic receptors. The second involves regulation of cytokinesis, which is the final stage of cell division. Further elucidation of the mechanisms of tumour suppression mediated by class III PI3K and PtdIns3P will identify novel Achilles' heels of the cell's defence against tumourigenesis and will be useful in the search for prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers in cancer.",cancer"Structure and function of human alpha-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells (HAMLET)-type complexes. Human alpha-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells (HAMLET) and equine lysozyme with oleic acid (ELOA) are complexes consisting of protein and fatty acid that exhibit cytotoxic activities, drastically differing from the activity of their respective proteinaceous compounds. Since the discovery of HAMLET in the 1990s, a wealth of information has been accumulated, illuminating the structural, functional and therapeutic properties of protein complexes with oleic acid, which is summarized in this review. In vitro, both HAMLET and ELOA are produced by using ion-exchange columns preconditioned with oleic acid. However, the complex of human alpha-lactalbumin with oleic acid with the antitumor activity of HAMLET was found to be naturally present in the acidic fraction of human milk, where it was discovered by serendipity. Structural studies have shown that alpha-lactalbumin in HAMLET and lysozyme in ELOA are partially unfolded, 'molten-globule'-like, thereby rendering the complexes dynamic and in conformational exchange. HAMLET exists in the monomeric form, whereas ELOA mostly exists as oligomers and the fatty acid stoichiometry varies, with HAMLET holding an average of approximately five oleic acid molecules, whereas ELOA contains a considerably larger number (11- 48). Potent tumoricidal activity is found in both HAMLET and ELOA, and HAMLET has also shown strong potential as an antitumor drug in different in vivo animal models and clinical studies. The gain of new, beneficial function upon partial protein unfolding and fatty acid binding is a remarkable phenomenon, and may reflect a significant generic route of functional diversification of proteins via varying their conformational states and associated ligands.",cancer"Natural and amyloid self-assembly of S100 proteins: structural basis of functional diversity. The S100 proteins are 10-12 kDa EF-hand proteins that act as central regulators in a multitude of cellular processes including cell survival, proliferation, differentiation and motility. Consequently, many S100 proteins are implicated and display marked changes in their expression levels in many types of cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The structure and function of S100 proteins are modulated by metal ions via Ca(2+) binding through EF-hand motifs and binding of Zn(2+) and Cu(2+) at additional sites, usually at the homodimer interfaces. Ca(2+) binding modulates S100 conformational opening and thus promotes and affects the interaction with p53, the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts and Toll-like receptor 4, among many others. Structural plasticity also occurs at the quaternary level, where several S100 proteins self-assemble into multiple oligomeric states, many being functionally relevant. Recently, we have found that the S100A8/A9 proteins are involved in amyloidogenic processes in corpora amylacea of prostate cancer patients, and undergo metal-mediated amyloid oligomerization and fibrillation in vitro. Here we review the unique chemical and structural properties of S100 proteins that underlie the conformational changes resulting in their oligomerization upon metal ion binding and ultimately in functional control. The possibility that S100 proteins have intrinsic amyloid-forming capacity is also addressed, as well as the hypothesis that amyloid self-assemblies may, under particular physiological conditions, affect the S100 functions within the cellular milieu.",cancer"Human papillomavirus type 16 variants in paired enrollment and follow-up cervical samples: implications for a proper understanding of type-specific persistent infections. Prospective studies of the persistence of human papillomavirus (HPV) variants are rare and typically small. We sequenced HPV-16 variants in longitudinal pairs of specimens from 86 women enrolled in the ASCUS-LSIL Triage Study. A change of variants was identified in 4 women (4.7% [95% confidence interval, 1.3%-11.5%]). Among women with intervening HPV results (n = 60), a variant switch occurred in 2 of 11 who had evidence of intervening negativity for HPV-16, compared with 1 of 49 who consistently tested positive (P = .11). These results suggest the possibility that rare misclassification of transient infections as persistent infections occurs in natural history studies of type-specific HPV infections.",cancer"Nonopioid anesthesia for awake craniotomy: a case report. Awake craniotomy is becoming more popular as a neurosurgical technique that allows for increased tumor resection and decreased postoperative neurologic morbidity. This technique, however, presents many challenges to both the neurosurgeon and anesthetist. An ASA class II, 37-year-old man with recurrent oligodendroglioma presented for repeated craniotomy. Prior craniotomy under general anesthesia resulted in residual neurologic deficits. An awake craniotomy was planned to allow for intraoperative testing for maximum tumor resection and avoidance of neurologic morbidity. The patient was sedated with propofol, and bupivacaine was infiltrated for placement of Mayfield tongs and skin incision. Following exposure of brain tissue, propofol infusion was discontinued to allow for patient cooperation during the procedure. Speech, motor, and sensory testing occurred during tumor resection until resection stopped after onset of weakness in the right arm. The propofol infusion was resumed while the cranium was closed and Mayfield tongs removed. The patient was awake, alert, oriented, and able to move all extremities but had residual weakness in the right forearm. Awake craniotomy requires appropriate patient selection, knowledge of the surgeon's skill, and a thorough anesthesia plan. This case report discusses the clinical and anesthetic management for awake craniotomy and reviews the literature.",cancer"Laryngeal inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor in a man: a case report. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a pseudosarcomatous lesion occurring in soft tissue and organs. It is known under a wide number of terms, such as inflammatory pseudotumor, plasma cell granuloma, pseudosarcomatous myofibroblastic proliferation. IMT is most commonly located in the lung, while laryngeal location is rarely described. Due to its biology it can be misdiagnosed as a malignant tumor. We present a case of IMT of larynx, recognized in time and treated with laser ablation. Our case demonstrates the importance of timely IMT recognition in order to avoid overtreatment. This diagnosis should also alert clinicians to close follow-up of these patients.",cancer"Surgical treatment of aortic dissection in a patient with metastatic prostate cancer. Acute aortic dissection bears all the stigmata of a true clinical emergency. The natural history of this acute aortic syndrome warrants prompt surgical intervention, with only a few absolute contraindications to this line of treatment. We present a 74-year-old man with documented metastatic prostate cancer who underwent emergent surgery for acute Stanford A aortic dissection. Having acknowledged the relatively favorable evolution of our patient's malignant disease, we were not deterred by its presence from pursuing surgical treatment of his aortic dissection.",cancer"The role of the nutrition in the pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux disease, Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma. This paper aims at evaluating the role of improper nutrition in the pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Barrett's oesophagus (BE), and oesophageal adenocarcinoma (EADC). It also tries to examine the influence of the alcohol, nicotine and coffee consumption in the development of the mentioned diseases. There were 180 subjects included in the trial, 109 males and 71 females, which were divided in the four groups (70 patients with GERD, 20 patients with BE, 20 patients with EADC, and 70 healthy examinees composing a control group). Their dietary habits were investigated by the usage of the dietary questionnaires. The results show that the fast eating and the insufficient mastication were present in 64.3-85.0% patients with GERD, BE, and EADC in comparison with only 15% of the examinees from the control group. Furthermore, very hot was preferred by 25.0-42.9% of the mentioned patients in comparison with only 12.9% from the control group. Similarly, 60.0-75.0% of them preferred strongly spiced food on contrary with 17.1% of the healthy examinees. Moreover, strong alcoholic beverages were consumed three or more times per week by 55.0-75.0% of the mentioned patients in comparison with only 15.7% from the control group. Finally, there were 15.7-55.0% heavy smokers among the patients with GERD, BE, and EADC contrary to 1.4% in the control group.",cancer"Gorski Kotar--an endemic region for primary gastric non-hodgkin lymphoma? Primary gastric non Hodgkin lymphoma (PGNHL) is a distinct group of extranodal lymphomas with interesting geographical distribution and variable prevalence in different countries. We analysed epidemiological data of our patients with PGNHL in Primorsko-goranska County. Clinical data of 30 patients with PGNHL diagnosed and treated in Clinical Hospital Center of Rijeka, Croatia between January 1995 and December 2005 were prospectively analyzed. We used statistical analysis (t-test, chi2-test) for small groups. Out of 30 pts with PGNHL, 19 were born in Primorsko-goranska County, part of Croatia situated by the Adriatic sea which consists of three regions: City of Rijeka, Islands and Gorski Kotar. 6 of 19 patients (31.6%) were originally from Gorski Kotar which made incidence rate of PGNHL in Gorski Kotar 7 times higher than in other two regions. Many authors emphasized that relative frequency of PGNHL is very variable in various countries and regions. Geographical distribution of our patients was very surprising because Gorski Kotar is the region with lowest number of citizens, rural area without any known pollutants, and ecologically one of the most preserved microsystem in this part of Croatia. Gorski Kotar is known to be an endemic region for multiple sclerosis and lyme borreliosis. Is it for PGNHL too?",cancer"Screening with mammography organized by family physicians teams: what have we learnt? The mammography, recommended as standard method for screening on breast cancer, can reveal suspicious lesions early enough to anable cancer elimination in entirely. Experience with women of the target population, 50-69 years old, included in the mass screening programs, show the reduction in the specific mortality by 30%. One of the main problem in organizing the preventive programs is how to increase responsiveness of subjects to screening. In the study, based on the large sample of over 1000 of subjects and 20 family medicine practices, included in the investigation, we showed that it is possible, by a pro-active involvement of family physicians teams and intensive educational and motivational activities, to achieve high level of over 80% of responsiveness to mammography screening. Analysis of the reasons of nonresponsiveness can contribute to better understanding of the mental processes included in a self-decision making. This, as the final aim, can help family physicians in their efforts to overcome many hidden barriers which obstruct their patients to accept the mammography screening.",cancer"Skin cancers in Croatia, 2003-2005: epidemiological study. This study presents the incidence of major nonmelanoma skin cancers (major NMSCs), other nonmelanoma skin cancers (other NMSCs) and malignant melanoma (MM) in Croatia. The skin cancers recorded between 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2005 were retrospectively analyzed. Until 2003, the incidence of major NMSCs and other NMSCs was not estimated in Croatia. Incident cases of NMSCs were identified by the use of a questionnaire distributed to dermatology departments in Croatia and then collected at the University Department of Dermatology and Venereology, Zagreb University Hospital Center, and from the records kept at the National Cancer Registry. Incident cases of MM were extracted from the National Cancer Registry. During the 3-year period, 9,479 cases of major NMSCs are recorded, 4,622 (49%) in male and 4,857 (51%) in female patients. The crude incidence rate was 72.1/100,000 for males and 70.3/100,000 for females. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) was the most common major NMSC in both sexes. In the total number of major NMSCs, there were 7,244 cases of BCC. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) was the second most common major NMSC. There were 1,860 SCC cases. The crude incidence rate was 54.9/100,000 for BCC in males, 53.9/100,000 in females, and 14.6/100,000 for SCC in male and 13.4/100,000 in female patients. Other NMSCs were registered in 119 cases (53% male and 47% female). The crude incidence rate was 0.9/100,000 for male and 0.8/100,000 for female patients. MM was registered in 1,427 cases (48% male and 52% female.) The crude incidence rate was 10.7/100,000 for males and females. These results will serve as reference for studying the patterns of descriptive epidemiology of major NMSCs, other NMSCs and MM in Croatia and Europe in the forthcoming years.",cancer"Effect of reimbursement changes on erythropoiesis-stimulating agent utilization and transfusions. Cancer patients frequently develop chemotherapy-induced anemia, which can be treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. These agents have shifted the standard of chemotherapy-induced anemia treatment away from the previous mainstay of red blood cell transfusions. In July 2007, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued a National Coverage Decision restricting reimbursement for erythropoiesis-stimulating agents to those chemotherapy patients who have hemoglobin levels <10 g/dL at initiation of therapy. This decision was hypothesized to place a greater reliance on transfusions for chemotherapy-induced anemia treatment. This observational study examined transfusions and erythropoiesis-stimulating agent utilization rates within defined episodes of chemotherapy care using electronic medical records from seven practices consisting of 39 sites of care across seven states. We compared the frequency of myelosuppressive chemotherapy treatment, erythropoiesis-stimulating agent administrations, and red blood cell transfusions before and after the National Coverage Decision in oncology patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia. Although exposure to myelosuppressive chemotherapy was not different, erythropoiesis-stimulating agent administrations significantly decreased and blood transfusions significantly increased after implementation of the National Coverage Decision. The 31% increase in transfusions for patients aged 65 years and older was significant (P = 0.007) and higher than the 8% increase for patients younger than 65 years (P = 0.358). Changes in practice patterns for chemotherapy-induced anemia treatment that followed the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reimbursement decision for erythropoiesis-stimulating agents seem to be impacting practice patterns. Further research is necessary to determine whether these changes represent a widespread and durable shift in patient treatment.",cancer"The dystonia gene DYT1 is repressed by the transcription factor THAP1 (DYT6). Mutations in THAP1 have been associated with dystonia 6. THAP1 encodes a transcription factor with mostly unknown targets. We tested the hypothesis that THAP1 regulates the expression of DYT1 (TOR1A), another dystonia-causing gene. After characterization of the TOR1A promoter, we demonstrate that THAP1 binds to the core promoter of TOR1A. Further, we report that wild type THAP1 represses the expression of TOR1A, whereas dystonia 6-associated mutant THAP1 results in decreased repression of TOR1A. Our data demonstrate that THAP1 regulates the transcription of TOR1A, suggesting transcriptional dysregulation as a cause of dystonia.",cancer"Safety of sentinel node biopsy in breast cancer patients who receive a second radioisotope injection after visualization failure in lymphoscintigraphy. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A failure to visualize axillary sentinel nodes in lymphoscintigraphy may lead to an unsuccessful sentinel node biopsy (SNB) and subsequent axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). To avoid unnecessary ALND, a second radioisotope injection may be given but has been considered hazardous. We investigated the axillary recurrence rate after tumor-negative SNB in breast cancer patients who received a second tracer injection after axillary visualization failure in lymphoscintigraphy. METHODS: Altogether 1,309 breast cancer patients who underwent a tumor-negative SNB without an ALND were included. Two hundred seven (15.8%) patients received a second tracer injection due to visualization failure in lymphoscintigraphy and 1,102 (84.2%) did not. All patients received a blue dye injection prior to the SNB. The median follow-up time was 43 months. RESULTS: No isolated cancer recurrences were diagnosed in the ipsilateral axilla among patients who received two radioisotope injections. Disease-free survival and overall survival were similar among patients with one or two radioisotope injections (P = 0.122 and P = 0.200, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Additional radiocolloid tracer injection after axillary non-visualization in lymphoscintigraphy is safe and does not increase axillary recurrence risk after tumor-negative SNB. The results suggest that such patients can be safely managed with SNB without a need to perform an ALND.",cancer"Cytoplasmic overexpression with membrane accentuation of stratifin in intrahepatic mass-forming cholangiocarcinoma after hepatectomy: correlation with clinicopathologic features and patient survival. PURPOSE: Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a lethal malignancy that afflicts thousands of patients worldwide. Stratifin has been shown to participate in mediating G2 arrest in several cancers, and cells that express stratifin could contribute to the chemo- and radioresistance of cancers and poor prognosis. However, the clinical impact of stratifin on clinicopathological features of mass forming (MF)-CCA is still unclear. METHODS: Seventy-eight patients with MF-CCA who had undergone hepatectomy were selected for an immunohistochemical study of stratifin. Sixteen clinicopathological variables were used for the survival analyses. RESULTS: Seventy-eight MF-CCA patients (36 men and 42 women) were studied. Cytoplasmic immunostaining with membrane prominence was found in 52.6% (41/78) of patients with MF-CCA after hepatectomy; this was significantly associated with elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. During the median follow-up duration of 13.6 months, the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 14.9%. Univariate analysis showed that an absence of clinical symptoms, better nutritional status, lower alkaline phosphatase, smaller tumor, negative lymph node metastasis, negative stratifin staining, and curative hepatic resection were associated with favorable OS rate for MF-CCA patients after hepatectomy. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that the absence of clinical symptoms, negative lymph node metastasis, and curative hepatectomy independently predicted MF-CCA patients with favorable OS rate after hepatectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of stratifin was significantly associated with elevated CEA levels in patients with MF-CCA. The favorable OS for MF-CCA patients depends on the absence of clinical symptoms, negative lymph node metastasis, and curative hepatectomy.",cancer"Surgical management in metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) patients after imatinib mesylate treatment. PURPOSE: Imatinib mesylate (IM) demonstrates substantial efficacy in most patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). However, progression of GIST eventually develops and emerges as a challenge. To assess the role of surgery in the multidisciplinary management of GISTs, we studied the surgical outcomes in GIST patients receiving IM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2001 and May 2009, 161 metastatic GIST patients received IM. Among them, 35 patients undergoing 38 surgeries were investigated. Patients were categorized based on extent of disease before surgery (responsive or stable disease (PR, SD), local progression (LP), and generalized progression (GP)). Each tumor was investigated for genetic alteration before and after surgery. RESULTS: Disease status before surgery was significantly associated with surgical result. Gross tumor clearance was achieved in 42.9% of patients with responsive disease, but only 4.8% of those with focal resistance and 0% of those with disease progression (P = 0.022). GIST patients with PR, SD, and LP had significant better 2-year progression-free survival and overall survival than those with GP. Secondary mutations tended to be found more frequently in GIST patients with LP after surgery than those with response (10/21 (47.6%) vs. 2/14 (14.3%); P = 0.07), indicating that surgery may prevent potential development of secondary mutation in GIST patients with response. Secondary kit mutations were also found more frequently with primary exon 11 mutation than those with exon 9 mutation (38.7% vs. 16.7%; P = 0.394). CONCLUSIONS: Surgery may benefit selected GIST patients with PR, SD, and LP, especially for patients with LP because patients with LP had comparable survival to that of patients with responsive lesion. Surgery may prevent potential development of secondary mutations in selected patients with response after IM treatment. Secondary kit mutation was found more frequently in GIST patients with a primary kit exon 11 mutation than those with a primary kit exon 9 mutation.",cancer"Accuracy and clinical relevance of computed tomography scan interpretation of peritoneal cancer index in colorectal cancer peritoneal carcinomatosis: a multi-institutional study. BACKGROUND: Evaluation of peritoneal metastases by computed tomography (CT) scans is challenging and has been reported to be inaccurate. METHODS: A multi-institutional prospective observational registry study of patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis from colorectal cancer was conducted and a subset analysis was performed to examine peritoneal cancer index (PCI) based on CT and intraoperative exploration. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients (mean age 52.6 +/- 12.4 years) from 16 institutions were included in this study. Inaccuracies of CT-based assessment of lesion sizes were observed in the RUQ (P = 0.004), LLQ (P < 0.0005), RLQ (P = 0.003), distal jejunum (P = 0.004), and distal ileum (P < 0.0005). When CT-PCI was classified based on the extent of carcinomatosis, 17 cases (33%) were underestimations, of which, 11 cases (21%) were upstaged from low to moderate, 4 cases (8%) were upstaged from low to severe, and 2 cases (4%) were upstaged from moderate to severe. Relevant clinical discordance where an upstage occurred to severe carcinomatosis constituted a true inaccuracy and was observed in six cases (12%). CONCLUSIONS: The actual clinical impact of inaccuracies of CT-PCI was modest. CT-PCI will remain as a mandatory imaging tool and may be supplemented with other tools including positron emission tomography scan or diagnostic laparoscopy, in the patient selection for cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy.",cancer"The extent of lymph node dissection for gastric cancer: a critical appraisal. The extent of lymphadenectomy during therapeutic gastrectomy for gastric cancer remains a protracted and controversial issue. While traditionally extended lymphadenectomy is performed in Eastern Asia, limited lymphadenectomy is advocated by most western surgeons. Two large western randomized trials, meta-analyses and a recent systematic review were unable to demonstrate overall benefit from extended lymphadenectomy. In this review, the currently available data on this topic are critically evaluated, while ongoing studies and future perspective are discussed.",cancer"Obstructions of portal veins and tumor numbers are associated with humped hepatocellular carcinoma. Tumor protrusion in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the risk signs of tumor rupture. Despite curative tumor treatments, HCC recurrences sometimes occur with rapidly growing humped or ruptured HCC in small sized tumors. The aim of this study was to clarify the characteristics of humped HCC clinically and radiologically associated with tumor progression, liver damage, and treatment. The subjects were 179 consecutive HCC patients who underwent angiographic examination. Dynamic studies, using helical computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were assessed, and the HCC area were measured. The tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage differed significantly between the humped and non-humped HCC groups. Humped HCC was more frequently observed in the right lobe (29.3% of right-lobe HCCs) than in the left (10.1%; p=0.003). Analysis of recurrent HCC revealed that patients with multiple treatments of >4 sessions had more humped HCC (33.8%) than those with 1-3 sessions (16.7%; p=0.042). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that tumor invasion in the portal vein, rather than large tumor size, was significantly associated with tumor protrusion. HCC recurrence with humped HCC occurs often in patients with multiple treatments. Tumor factors of the TNM classification, especially tumor invasion in the portal vein, might be associated with the mechanisms of tumor protrusion.",cancer"Cancer of unknown primary site: a review of 28 cases and the efficacy of cisplatin/docetaxel therapy at a single institute in Japan. We evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of cisplatin/docetaxel (CDDP/TXT) chemotherapy and identified prognostic factors in Japanese patients with cancer of unknown primary site (CUP). Twenty-eight consecutive patients seen at a single institute were reviewed retrospectively. Sixteen patients were treated with TXT 80 mg/m2, followed by CDDP 75 mg/m2. The overall response rate to CDDP/TXT treatment was 62.5%, with a median survival time (MST) of 22.7 months. Common adverse reactions were myelosuppression and hyponatremia. The MST of all 28 patients with CUP was 8.3 months, and the 1-year overall survival rate was 45.6%. Univariate analysis identified 5 prognostic factors:performance status, liver involvement, bone involvement, pleural involvement, and lymph node involvement. In conclusion, CDDP/TXT chemotherapy is effective with tolerable toxicity in patients with CUP. Japanese patients with CUP might be chemosensitive and may survive longer.",cancer"Epigenetic choreographers of neurogenesis in the adult mammalian brain. Epigenetic mechanisms regulate cell differentiation during embryonic development and also serve as important interfaces between genes and the environment in adulthood. Neurogenesis in adults, which generates functional neural cell types from adult neural stem cells, is dynamically regulated by both intrinsic state-specific cell differentiation cues and extrinsic neural niche signals. Epigenetic regulation by DNA and histone modifiers, non-coding RNAs and other self-sustained mechanisms can lead to relatively long-lasting biological effects and maintain functional neurogenesis throughout life in discrete regions of the mammalian brain. Here, we review recent evidence that epigenetic mechanisms carry out diverse roles in regulating specific aspects of adult neurogenesis and highlight the implications of such epigenetic regulation for neural plasticity and disorders.",cancer"Well-differentiated osteosarcoma of the jaw bones: a clinicopathologic study of 15 cases. Well-differentiated osteosarcoma of the jaw bones is rare, and is often confused with a variety of benign fibroosseous lesions. To better understand its clinicopathologic features, we reviewed our experience with 15 cases. The patients included 7 males and 8 females (age range 14 to 66 y; mean 42.8 y). Six of the tumors arose in the mandible, and 9 in the maxilla. Microscopically, the tumors were infiltrative, relatively hypocellular, and consisted of monomorphic, minimally atypical spindle cells that were usually arranged in fascicles. The tumor cells were intimately related to the surfaces of elongated trabeculae of neoplastic woven bone that lacked osteoblastic rimming. Nine patients were treated with wide excision, 2 patients with marginal excision, and 2 patients with excision and radiation therapy. After definitive therapy, there were no reports of recurrence or metastasis over an average follow-up of 34 months (range 1 to 80 mo). Well-differentiated gnathic osteosarcoma is a low-grade malignancy that may be successfully treated with wide local excision. The prognosis in our series was excellent.",cancer"Invasive ductal carcinomas of the breast showing partial reversed cell polarity are associated with lymphatic tumor spread and may represent part of a spectrum of invasive micropapillary carcinoma. Invasive micropapillary carcinomas (IMPC) of the breast are aggressive tumors frequently associated with lymphatic invasion and nodal metastasis even when micropapillary (MP) differentiation is very focal within the tumors. We have noticed that some breast carcinomas showing lymphatic spread but lacking histologic features of IMPC have occasional tumor cell clusters reminiscent of those of IMPC without the characteristic prominent retraction artifact. To study the clinicopathologic significance of such features, we prospectively selected 1323 invasive ductal carcinomas and determined the presence and extent of MP differentiation and retraction artifact in the tumors. One representative tumor block per case was used for immunostaining for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA). Partial reverse cell polarity (PRCP) was defined as prominent linear EMA reactivity on at least part of the periphery of tumor cell clusters usually associated with decreased cytoplasmic staining. The clinicopathologic features of carcinomas with PRCP were compared with IMPC and invasive ductal (no special type) carcinomas without this feature. Of the 1323 cases, 96 (7.3%) and 92 (7.0%) showed MP features and the presence of PRCP, respectively. We found that the presence of both PRCP and MP features were strongly associated with decreased cytoplasmic EMA immunoreactivity and the presence of lymphatic invasion and nodal metastasis, even if such features were present only very focally. Our results suggest that breast carcinomas with PRCP may have the same implication as MP differentiation and these tumors may represent part of a spectrum of IMPC. Complete or partial reversal of cell polarity may play a significant role in lymphatic tumor spread.",cancer"Steatohepatitic hepatocellular carcinoma (SH-HCC): a distinctive histological variant of HCC in hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis with associated NAFLD/NASH. In explant livers with chronic hepatitis C (HCV-C) we have noted a distinctive histologic variant that we have termed steatohepatitic hepatocellular carcinoma (SH-HCC) with features resembling non-neoplastic steatohepatitis, including large droplet steatosis, ballooning of malignant hepatocytes, Mallory-Denk bodies, inflammation, and pericellular fibrosis. This study was undertaken to further describe the characteristics and prevalence of this histologic variant in HCV-C and any possible association with underlying risk factors for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We selected two 2-year periods (mid-2003 to mid-2005 and 2007 to 2008), from which selected explant livers with HCV-C and HCC were examined to determine the characteristics and frequency of SH-HCC. The underlying cirrhotic liver was also reassessed for steatosis and evidence of steatohepatitis. Clinical records were consulted for concomitant NAFLD and NASH risk factors. The SH-HCC variant was found in a total of 22 of 62 HCC cases (35.5%). Fourteen of the 22 patients with SH-HCC (63.6%) had at least one known risk factor for NAFLD/NASH including diabetes (6 of 22, 27.3%), obesity (6 of 22, 27.3%), hypertension (11 of 22, 50%), and hyperlipidemia (5 of 22, 27.8%). In 14 of the 22 cases (63.6%) of SH-HCC, the non-neoplastic liver showed changes of NAFLD/NASH superimposed on otherwise typical features of HCV-C. In conclusion, in our series of HCV-C explants, approximately one-third of HCCs show a distinctive histological variant termed SH-HCC. Underlying risk factors for NAFLD and for NASH were identified in 63.6% of our cases. Moreover, non-neoplastic tissue in HCV-C explants showed changes of NAFLD/NASH in 63.6% of cases. These results suggest a possible NAFLD/NASH pathway leading to SH-HCC in the setting of HCV-C which requires further investigation in the future.",cancer"Medical implications of erectile dysfunction. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common condition in aging men, with a prevalence of 52% in men aged 40 to 70 years. It is frequently associated with several comorbid conditions, including cardiovascular disease, lower urinary tract symptoms, and testosterone deficiency. These conditions often have major consequences on the quality of life of patients and require adequate evaluation by the primary care practitioner. Complaints of ED, therefore, serve as a marker for these conditions and give the practitioner an opportunity to prevent the consequences of a delay in treatment. In this article, the evidence behind these associations is described.",nocancer"Evaluation and treatment of erectile dysfunction. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a prevalent and important disease that has been associated with various comorbidities. The evaluation of patients with ED should include a general health assessment followed by a discussion of reversible factors and lifestyle changes that might help preserve erectile capacity. Numerous effective treatment options are currently available. A frank discussion about use and side effects of these therapies is required to optimize success. Although oral pharmacologic treatments can be initiated and monitored by the primary care physician, patients who do not experience response to these treatments may be best served by referral to a sexual medicine specialist for further assessment and consideration of other treatment options. This article discusses the physiology and pathophysiology of erectile function in men, how the primary care physician may address the clinical problem of ED in practice, and when specialty referral is indicated.",nocancer"Medical and medical/urologic approaches in acute and chronic urologic stone disease. Urinary stone disease is a condition with far-reaching implications. Patients with their initial instance of acute renal colic enter the health care system through 2 routes. Severe cases are generally seen in the emergency room, whereas more tolerable cases may be seen by primary care physicians. Patients with urinary stone disease are then managed in the long-term by a urologist. Timely and appropriate treatment of patients with urinary stone disease is essential to prevent the development of sepsis and progressive renal insufficiency. This article reviews the epidemiology, pathogenesis, presentation, and short- and long-term management of acute and chronic urinary stone disease.",nocancer"Urologic assessment of decreasing renal function. The discussion of renal failure as it relates to urology is largely a discussion of obstructive uropathy. Obstructive uropathy has been identified in multiple series to account for approximately 10% of all cases of renal failure. On a total population scale, autopsy series have shown the prevalence of hydronephrosis in 3% of men and women who are younger than 65 years and 6% of men older than 65 years. When benign prostatic hypertrophy and renal stone disease are considered, obstructive uropathy is also one of the most common indications for surgery. In this review, the different causes of obstructive renal insufficiency and management options available are discussed.",nocancer"Assessment of hematuria. The most common causes of hematuria in adults include urinary tract infections, urolithiasis, benign prostatic enlargement, and urologic malignancy. Once hematuria is confirmed, its cause should be investigated through a comprehensive history, a focused physical examination, laboratory studies, an image-based assessment of the upper urinary tract, and a cystoscopic evaluation of the lower urinary system. Prompt evaluation and appropriate referral of patients with documented hematuria should be initiated in the primary care setting according to the proposed guidelines, and aimed at cost-effective and early detection of urologic abnormality.",nocancer"Urologic aspects of HIV infection. Although lifespan has dramatically improved in the human immunodeficiency virus-positive (HIV+) population, HIV and its treatment continue to be a source of substantial morbidity in many organ systems, including the genitourinary tract. As the number of long-term survivors increases with advances in antiretroviral therapy, age-associated urologic symptoms are also becoming increasingly relevant considerations for people living with HIV. Primary care physicians have a major role to play in maintaining the genitourinary health of their HIV+ patients. This role is of great importance not just for the well-being of the individual patient but for the public health, as the genitourinary tract is a common vector for HIV transmission. In this article the authors review the management of the genitourinary system in patients with HIV infection. Particular consideration is given to urinary tract infections, lower urinary tract symptoms, renal insufficiency, sexual and fertility problems, and cancers of the genitourinary tract. Management algorithms are outlined and indications for referral to a urologist are emphasized.",nocancer"Assessment and management of irritative voiding symptoms. Irritative voiding symptoms are to the urinary tract much as a cough is to the pulmonary system, that is, a nonspecific manifestation of multiple potential underlying causes. Key to the evaluation and management of patients with these symptoms is a clear understanding of the differential diagnosis, the diagnostic tests required for evaluation, and the role of specialists in diagnosis and treatment. This article outlines a general diagnostic approach for patients with irritative voiding symptoms. Treatment approaches for the diseases, as well as the initial management that may be performed in the primary care setting, are also discussed.",nocancer"The neurogenic bladder: an update with management strategies for primary care physicians. Patients with lesions of the central nervous system often have neurogenic bladder dysfunction. Lifelong bladder monitoring and management in these patients is necessary to prevent severe complications, including renal damage. The urodynamic test, performed by neurourologists or other specially trained providers, is the definitive test for diagnosis and management of neurogenic bladder dysfunction. This article describes the indications and technique of urodynamic testing and the interpretation of the results of such testing. The management of patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction is also discussed.",nocancer"Urinary incontinence in women. Urinary incontinence is a common and vexing problem that affects millions of adults. The main types of incontinence in women are stress, urge, and mixed. It is important to delineate the different types to target the treatment options better. Treatments include conservative or behavioral modifications, pharmacotherapy, and surgical interventions.",nocancer"Male lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Male lower urinary tract symptoms, benign prostatic hyperplasia, enlargement of the prostate, and bladder outlet obstruction are common among aging men and will increase in socioeconomic and medical importance at a time of increased life expectancy and aging of the baby boomer generation. This article reviews the epidemiology, management, and therapeutic options for these conditions. In patients bothered by moderate to severe symptoms, providers can make educated and differential choices between several classes of drugs, alone or in combination, to treat effectively and improve the symptoms in most men. Despite the efficacy of medical therapy, there will be patients who require referral to a urologist either early, to rule out prostate cancer and other conditions, or later, after initial medical therapy and lifestyle management has failed. Perhaps as many as 30% of patients fail to achieve sufficient symptom improvement with medication, lifestyle adjustment, and fluid management, and may require more invasive or surgical treatment options.",nocancer"Prostatitis and chronic pelvic pain syndrome in men. Primary care physicians can and should diagnose, classify, and treat patients presenting with acute and chronic prostatitis syndromes. Although the chronic syndromes are a challenge to manage, this review article provides the necessary background to allow primary care physicians to take on this task. Patients who are unfortunate to be diagnosed with a prostatitis syndrome have the best chance for successful therapy at initial presentation. Those patients will ultimately benefit from an informed and educated physician.",nocancer"Bladder pain syndrome. Bladder pain syndrome is a deceptively intricate symptom complex that is diagnosed on the basis of chronic pelvic pain, pressure, or discomfort perceived to be related to the urinary bladder, accompanied by at least one other urinary symptom. It is a diagnosis of exclusion in a patient who has experienced the symptoms for at least 6 weeks in the absence of any confusable diseases that may give rise to the symptoms. Symptoms compatible with the diagnosis are now thought to affect up to 3% of the female population in the United States with a 5:1 female-to-male preponderance. Diagnosis and treatment can be challenging, and misdiagnosis as a psychological problem, overactive bladder, or chronic urinary infection has plagued patients with the problem.",nocancer"Urinary infections in men. Urinary tract infections are one of the most common bacterial infections and account for significant morbidity and mortality. This review of urinary infections in men provides an overview of the general presentation, diagnosis, and management of common genitourinary infections in men. The focus of this article is on clinical presentation, basic diagnostic evaluation strategies, treatment options, and when referral to a specialist is warranted.",nocancer"Urinary tract infections in women. Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common extraintestinal infectious disease entity in women worldwide, and perhaps one of the most formidable challenges in clinical practice given its high prevalence, frequent recurrence, and myriad associated morbidities in the setting of rapidly evolving antimicrobial resistance. Achieving timely symptom relief and infection control and preventing morbidity, growth of resistant organisms, and recurrent infection are often difficult. This article reviews epidemiology and pathogenesis of urinary tract infection in women; characterizes common patterns of infection, clinical red flags, and appropriate laboratory testing and imaging; explores emerging patterns of antimicrobial resistance; and reviews the updated guidelines for the treatment of uncomplicated UTI in women.",nocancer"Long-term follow-up and late complications following treatment of pediatric urologic disorders. Many pediatric urologic disorders have sequelae that may affect patients well into adulthood. Despite adequate treatment, many patients are at risk for progressive urologic deterioration years after surgical reconstruction. While many pediatric urologists follow their patients years after surgery, screening for late complications is a shared responsibility with primary care providers. This article discusses potential late complications and appropriate follow-up for patients who have a history of ureteral reimplantation, pyeloplasty, hypospadias repair, posterior urethral valve ablation, and intestinal interposition.",nocancer"Pediatric urologic conditions, including urinary infections. Genitourinary complaints are common in children, and the busy primary care provider must determine initial treatment and assess need for specialty referral. Many complaints are self-limited, but some represent disorders that can threaten organ function. In this article, an initial approach in the primary care office and a guide to specialty referral for pediatric urologic conditions of the urinary tract, male genitalia, and female genitalia are suggested.",nocancer"Neutrophils, from marrow to microbes. Neutrophils are produced in the bone marrow from stem cells that proliferate and differentiate to mature neutrophils fully equipped with an armory of granules. These contain proteins that enable the neutrophil to deliver lethal hits against microorganisms, but also to cause great tissue damage. Neutrophils circulate in the blood as dormant cells. At sites of infection, endothelial cells capture bypassing neutrophils and guide them through the endothelial cell lining whereby the neutrophils are activated and tuned for the subsequent interaction with microbes. Once in tissues, neutrophils kill microorganisms by microbicidal agents liberated from granules or generated by metabolic activation. As a final act, neutrophils can extrude stands of DNA with bactericidal proteins attached that act as extracellular traps for microorganisms.",nocancer"Hospital based emergency department visits attributed to dental caries in the United States in 2006. OBJECTIVE: There is a paucity of published studies presenting nationally representative estimates on hospital-based emergency department visits primarily attributed to dental caries. The objective of this study is to provide estimates of hospital-based emergency department visits attributed to dental caries in the United States. METHODS: The Nationwide Emergency Department Sample, a component of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, was used for this study. All emergency department visits attributable to dental caries were identified using ICD-9-CM diagnoses codes and selected for analysis. Outcomes including hospital charges and length of stay in hospital were examined. Simple descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data. RESULTS: This study found that in 2006, a total of 330,757 visits to hospital-based emergency departments occurred in the United States. The total charges were $110 million. Approximately 45% of all visits by adults occurred among the uninsured. Medicaid was the most common payer for all visits by children, accounting for nearly 53% of all visits. About 38% of visits occurred among those residing in low-income areas. Hospitalization was required for 158 visits. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides nationwide estimates of hospital-based emergency department visits attributed to dental caries in the United States. The uninsured constituted the greatest proportion of emergency department visits among adults, whereas Medicaid was the major payer for children visiting the emergency departments.",nocancer"Barriers to implementing evidence-based clinical guidelines: a survey of early adopters. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify barriers that early-adopting dentists perceive as common and challenging when implementing recommendations from evidence-based (EB) clinical guidelines. METHOD: This is a cross-sectional study. Dentists who attended the 2008 Evidence-based Dentistry Champion Conference were eligible for inclusion. Forty-three dentists (34%) responded to a 22-item questionnaire administered online. Two investigators independently coded and categorized responses to open-ended items. Descriptive statistics were computed to assess the frequency of barriers and perceived challenges. RESULTS: The most common barriers to implementation were difficulty in changing current practice model, resistance and criticism from colleagues, and lack of trust in evidence or research. Barriers perceived as serious problems had to do with lack of up-to-date evidence, lack of clear answers to clinical questions, and contradictory information in the scientific literature. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of barriers will help improve translation of biomedical research for dentists. Information in guidelines needs to be current, clear, and simplified for use at chairside; dentists' fears need to be addressed.",nocancer"Gummy smile and botulinum toxin: a new approach based on the gingival exposure area. BACKGROUND: Gummy smile (GS) is an aesthetic disorder for some patients, which can be corrected by injection of botulinum toxin. OBJECTIVE: We sought to classify GS according to the area of gingival exposure and the respective muscles involved in order to perfect the botulinum toxin injection technique for each patient. METHODS: Sixteen patients with GS were evaluated before receiving botulinum toxin injections. Based on the area of excessive gum displayed and identification of the muscles involved, 4 different types of GS were identified: anterior, posterior, mixed, and asymmetric. AbobotulinumtoxinA (Dysport, Ipsen Biopharm Limited, Wrexham, UK) was injected using a different injection technique for each type of GS, based on the main muscles involved. With the aid of two computer programs, the area of gum exposed was measured before and after the application of abobotulinumtoxinA, to evaluate the level of improvement. RESULTS: There was a decrease in the degree of gum display in all patients. The general average improvement achieved was 75.09%. Two patients showed slight adverse effects that were easily corrected with additional doses of abobotulinumtoxinA. LIMITATIONS: For this study, there was no sample size calculation and no statistical analysis of the cases. CONCLUSION: The authors conclude that it is important to identify the type of GS and therefore the main muscles involved, so that the correct injection technique can be used. AbobotulinumtoxinA was shown to be effective and safe for use in all types of GS in the present sample.",nocancer"The use of cyclosporine in dermatology: part II. Cyclosporine is highly effective in the treatment of a multitude of dermatoses. Concern over its side effect profile has limited its use in dermatology. Adverse effects are, for the most part, dose dependent and related to duration of therapy. Using the recommended monitoring protocols results in a significant decrease in the incidence of cyclosporine-related toxicities. This article provides a comprehensive review of the pharmacokinetics of cyclosporine, potential drug interactions, adverse effects, and recommendations for monitoring in patients treated with cyclosporine. The use of cyclosporine in pregnancy and in the pediatric population is also addressed. LEARNING OBJECTIVES: After completing this learning activity, participants should be familiar with the monitoring guidelines of cyclosporine, its contraindications, its possible drug interactions, its adverse effect profile, and its use in pregnancy and the childhood and adolescent populations.",nocancer"The use of cyclosporine in dermatology: part I. Cyclosporine is a calcineurin inhibitor that acts selectively on T cells. It has been used in dermatology since 1997 for its US Food and Drug Administration indication of psoriasis and off-label for various other inflammatory skin conditions, including atopic dermatitis, blistering disorders, and connective tissue diseases. In the last decade, many dermatologists have hesitated to use this important drug in their clinical practices because of its toxicity profile. The purpose of this article is to review the mechanism of action of cyclosporine and its current uses and dosing schedules. It is our goal to create a framework in which dermatologists feel comfortable and safe incorporating cyclosporine into their prescribing regimens. LEARNING OBJECTIVES: After completing this learning activity, participants should be able to describe the mechanism of action of cyclosporine, recognize the potential role of cyclosporine in dermatology and the evidence to support this role, and incorporate cyclosporine into his or her prescribing regimens.",nocancer"STAT6 transcription factor is a facilitator of the nuclear receptor PPARgamma-regulated gene expression in macrophages and dendritic cells. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) is a lipid-activated transcription factor regulating lipid metabolism and inflammatory response in macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). These immune cells exposed to distinct inflammatory milieu show cell type specification as a result of altered gene expression. We demonstrate here a mechanism how inflammatory molecules modulate PPARgamma signaling in distinct subsets of cells. Proinflammatory molecules inhibited whereas interleukin-4 (IL-4) stimulated PPARgamma activity in macrophages and DCs. Furthermore, IL-4 signaling augmented PPARgamma activity through an interaction between PPARgamma and signal transducer and activators of transcription 6 (STAT6) on promoters of PPARgamma target genes, including FABP4. Thus, STAT6 acts as a facilitating factor for PPARgamma by promoting DNA binding and consequently increasing the number of regulated genes and the magnitude of responses. This interaction, underpinning cell type-specific responses, represents a unique way of controlling nuclear receptor signaling by inflammatory molecules in immune cells.",nocancer"Cell-cell propagation of NF-kappaB transcription factor and MAP kinase activation amplifies innate immunity against bacterial infection. The enteroinvasive bacterium Shigella flexneri uses multiple secreted effector proteins to downregulate interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression in infected epithelial cells. Yet, massive IL-8 secretion is observed in Shigellosis. Here we report a host mechanism of cell-cell communication that circumvents the effector proteins and strongly amplifies IL-8 expression during bacterial infection. By monitoring proinflammatory signals at the single-cell level, we found that the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB and the MAP kinases JNK, ERK, and p38 rapidly propagated from infected to uninfected adjacent cells, leading to IL-8 production by uninfected bystander cells. Bystander IL-8 production was also observed during Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella typhimurium infection. This response could be triggered by recognition of peptidoglycan and is mediated by gap junctions. Thus, we have identified a mechanism of cell-cell communication that amplifies innate immunity against bacterial infection by rapidly spreading proinflammatory signals via gap junctions to yet uninfected cells.",nocancer"Renal sympathetic denervation in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension (The Symplicity HTN-2 Trial): a randomised controlled trial. BACKGROUND: Activation of renal sympathetic nerves is key to pathogenesis of essential hypertension. We aimed to assess effectiveness and safety of catheter-based renal denervation for reduction of blood pressure in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension. METHODS: In this multicentre, prospective, randomised trial, patients who had a baseline systolic blood pressure of 160 mm Hg or more (>/=150 mm Hg for patients with type 2 diabetes), despite taking three or more antihypertensive drugs, were randomly allocated in a one-to-one ratio to undergo renal denervation with previous treatment or to maintain previous treatment alone (control group) at 24 participating centres. Randomisation was done with sealed envelopes. Data analysers were not masked to treatment assignment. The primary effectiveness endpoint was change in seated office-based measurement of systolic blood pressure at 6 months. Primary analysis included all patients remaining in follow-up at 6 months. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00888433. FINDINGS: 106 (56%) of 190 patients screened for eligibility were randomly allocated to renal denervation (n=52) or control (n=54) groups between June 9, 2009, and Jan 15, 2010. 49 (94%) of 52 patients who underwent renal denervation and 51 (94%) of 54 controls were assessed for the primary endpoint at 6 months. Office-based blood pressure measurements in the renal denervation group reduced by 32/12 mm Hg (SD 23/11, baseline of 178/96 mm Hg, p<0.0001), whereas they did not differ from baseline in the control group (change of 1/0 mm Hg [21/10], baseline of 178/97 mm Hg, p=0.77 systolic and p=0.83 diastolic). Between-group differences in blood pressure at 6 months were 33/11 mm Hg (p<0.0001). At 6 months, 41 (84%) of 49 patients who underwent renal denervation had a reduction in systolic blood pressure of 10 mm Hg or more, compared with 18 (35%) of 51 controls (p<0.0001). We noted no serious procedure-related or device-related complications and occurrence of adverse events did not differ between groups; one patient who had renal denervation had possible progression of an underlying atherosclerotic lesion, but required no treatment. INTERPRETATION: Catheter-based renal denervation can safely be used to substantially reduce blood pressure in treatment-resistant hypertensive patients. FUNDING: Ardian.",nocancer"Prospective clinical and radiographic results of CHARITE III artificial total disc arthroplasty at 2- to 7-year follow-up: a Canadian experience. BACKGROUND: Early and intermediate results have shown that the SB CHARITE III total disc arthroplasty (TDA) favourably compares to spinal fusion, but is associated with fewer complications and higher levels of satisfaction. We sought to prospectively report the clinical and radiographic results of the CHARITE III TDA after an average of 55 months follow-up. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of patients receiving the CHARITE TDA at either L4-5 or L5-S1 between April 2001 and November 2006. The primary indication for surgery was discogenic low-back pain confirmed by provocative discography. Assessment included pre- and postoperative (3, 6 and 12 mo and yearly thereafter) validated patient outcome measures and radiographic review. RESULTS: Fifty-seven of the potential 64 (89%) patients were available for complete follow-up. Their mean age was 39 (range 21-59) years. A statistically significant improvement was demonstrated between all the mean pre- and postoperative intervals for the Oswestry Disability Index, visual analogue scale for back and leg pain, and Short Form-36 health survey (p < 0.001). The mean sagittal rotation was 6.5 degrees (range 0.5 degrees -22.4 degrees ), and the mean intervertebral translation was 1.1 mm (range 0-2.4 mm). Subsidence of the implant was present in 44 of 53 (83%) patients with an L5-S1 disc arthroplasty. The mean subsidence was 1.7 mm (range 0-4.8 mm). CONCLUSION: The 2- to 7-year follow-up of this cohort of patients demonstrated satisfactory clinical and radiographic results in a carefully selected patient population. The radiographic assessment confirmed preservation and maintenance of motion at the replaced disc during the period of follow-up.",nocancer"Selective use of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography in clinical practice may miss choledocholithiasis in gallstone pancreatitis. BACKGROUND: Gallstone pancreatitis is a consequence of ampullary obstruction by common bile duct (CBD) calculi. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) has been advocated for routine use to diagnose choledocholithiasis. However, the selective use of MRCP in clinically equivocal situations has not been explored until now. This study examines the diagnostic value of selective MRCP in gallstone pancreatitis. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective audit of all presentations of gallstone pancreatitis between January 2001 and December 2007 at Middlemore Hospital, Auckland, New Zealand. Demographic data, clinical presentation, biochemical and radiological findings and outcomes were reviewed. RESULTS: There were 339 cases of gallstone pancreatitis during the study period; 236 patients were women and the mean age was 52 years. Overall, choledocholithiasis was diagnosed in 95 patients. A total of 117 patients underwent MRCP within a median of 4 days of admission, with 15 (13.7%) showing choledocholithiasis. There was no significant difference in time to MRCP between positive and negative groups. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)/intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) confirmed 13 of 15 stones within a median of 2.5 days. However, MRCP missed 8 cases of choledocholithiasis subsequently demonstrated on ERCP/IOC, where clinical suspicion remained after a negative MRCP. Its sensitivity was 62% and specificity 98%. The positive likelihood ratio was 6.5 and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.1. In all, 222 patients followed different clinical pathways with 82 CBD stones diagnosed by ERCP/IOC. CONCLUSION: Selective MRCP is highly specific in gallstone pancreatitis but may not be sensitive enough to exclude choledocholithiasis in this context.",nocancer"Preoperative bowel preparation for patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery: a clinical practice guideline endorsed by the Canadian Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons. BACKGROUND: Despite evidence that mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) does not reduce the rate of postoperative complications, many surgeons still use MBP before surgery. We sought to appraise and synthesize the available evidence regarding preoperative bowel preparation in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Databases to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing patients who received a bowel preparation with those who did not. Two authors reviewed the abstracts to identify articles for critical appraisal. We used the methods of the United States Preventive Services Task Force to grade study quality and level of evidence, as well as formulate the final recommendations. Outcomes assessed included postoperative infectious complications, such as anastomotic dehiscence and superficial surgical site infections. RESULTS: Our review identified 14 RCTs and 8 meta-analyses. Based on the quality and content of these original manuscripts, we formulated 6 recommendations for various aspects of bowel preparation in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery. CONCLUSION: Taking into account the lack of difference in postoperative infectious complication rates when MBP is omitted and the adverse effects of MBP, we believe that, based on the literature, MBP before surgery should be omitted.",nocancer"Clinical outcomes of midclavicular fractures treated with titanium elastic nails. BACKGROUND: Midclavicular fractures are common clinically, accounting for about 76% of all clavicular fractures. Recent studies have revealed a previously unrecognized incidence of nonunion and malunion after conservative treatment of more severe midclavicular fractures. Our aim was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of midclavicular fractures treated with titanium elastic nails. METHODS: From February 2005 to February 2007, 41 patients with displaced midclavicular fractures received open reduction and internal fixation with a titanium elastic nail inserted through the sternal end of the clavicle. We evaluated the visual analogue scale (VAS), the Constant score and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) scale to determine outcomes. RESULTS: A mean follow-up of 14.5 months (range 7-24 mo) revealed radiographic fracture union in all patients with an average clinical healing time of 2.2 months. Mean subjective pain 3 days after surgery was significantly lower than the day before surgery (p < 0.001). The mean range of motion 3 days after surgery was significantly improved compared with the day before surgery (p < 0.001). The nails were removed in all patients a mean of 7.2 months (range 5.4-9.5 mo) after surgery, and no fractures recurred. The mean postoperative DASH score was 2.5 (range 0.5-8.0) and the mean postoperative Constant score was 95.2 (range 86.5-97.0). CONCLUSION: Limited open reduction and internal fixation with titanium elastic nails is a safe and minimally invasive surgical procedure for the treatment of displaced midclavicular fractures in adults and achieves good functional results and high patient satisfaction.",nocancer"Rural patients' experiences accessing surgery in British Columbia. BACKGROUND: More than 33% of Canadians live in rural areas. The vulnerability of rural surgical patients makes them particularly sensitive to barriers to accessing health care. This study aims to describe rural patients' experiences accessing local nonspecialist, family physician-surgeon care and regional specialist surgical care when no local surgical care was available. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative pilot study of self-selected patients. Interviews were analyzed using a modified Delphi technique and NVivo qualitative software. RESULTS: The needs of rural surgical patients were reflective of Maslow's hierarchy of needs: physiologic, safety and security, community belonging and self-esteem/self-actualization. Rural patients expressed a strong desire for individualized care in a familiar environment. When such care was not available, patients found it difficult to meet even basic physiologic needs. Maternity patients and marginalized populations were particularly vulnerable. CONCLUSION: Rural patients seem to prefer individualized care in a familiar environment to address more of their qualitative emotional, psychological and cultural needs rather than only the physiologic needs of surgery. Larger studies are needed to delineate more clearly the qualitative aspects of surgical care.",nocancer"Adherence to perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis among orthopedic trauma patients. BACKGROUND: The goal of this study was to assess whether patients receive their antibiotic prophylaxis as prescribed. We also investigated what doses and durations of antibiotics are typically ordered, which patients actually receive antibiotics and factors causing the ordered antibiotic regimen to be altered. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 205 patient charts and sent a national survey to all surgeon members of the Canadian Orthopaedic Trauma Society (COTS) about antibiotic prophylaxis in the setting of surgical treatment for closed fractures. RESULTS: In all, 93% (179 of 193) of patients received an appropriate preoperative dose of antibiotics, whereas less than 32% (58 of 181) of patients received their postoperative antibiotics as ordered. The most commonly stated reason for patients not receiving their postoperative antibiotics as ordered was patients being discharged before completing 3 postoperative doses. There was a 70% (39 of 56) response rate to the survey sent to COTS surgeons. A single dose of a first-generation cephalosporin preoperatively followed by 3 doses postoperatively is the most common practice among orthopedic trauma surgeons across Canada, but several surgeons give only preoperative prophylaxis. CONCLUSION: Adherence to multidose postoperative antibiotic regimens is poor. Meta-analyses have failed to demonstrate the superiority of multidose regimens over single-dose prophylaxis. Single-dose preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis may be a reasonable choice for most orthopedic trauma patients with closed fractures.",nocancer"Micronutrient adequacy and morbidity: paucity of information in children with cerebral palsy. A literature review was conducted to investigate the status of vitamins and minerals in children with cerebral palsy and the implications of various deficiencies on health outcomes. Children with cerebral palsy commonly have feeding difficulties, which significantly impact their growth, general health, and life expectancy. Current nutritional literature focuses on energy expenditure, with little information available on other parameters, such as micronutrient status. Due to the paucity of micronutrient research in these children, the impacts of deficiencies and benefits in other populations have been considered. The role of micronutrients in maintaining cellular homeostasis throughout all body systems highlights a need for future research and monitoring of their levels, particularly in vulnerable populations with well-documented incidence of undernutrition.",nocancer"Curcumin and obesity: evidence and mechanisms. The incidence of obesity is increasing worldwide and is hence considered a major public health concern. Obesity underlies the development of several metabolic complications including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and inflammation. Research on ways to slow the development of obesity have traditionally focused on dietary and lifestyle modifications such as restricting caloric intake and increasing physical activity. An area that has recently aroused considerable research interest is investigating the potential role of spices, particularly the Asian spice turmeric, for combating obesity. Curcumin is the active ingredient in turmeric. Evidence suggests curcumin may regulate lipid metabolism, which plays a central role in the development of obesity and its complications. The present review addresses the evidence and mechanisms by which curcumin may play a role in downregulating obesity and reducing the impact of associated problems.",nocancer"Can consuming flavonoids restore old microglia to their youthful state? Microglial cells, which are resident macrophages in the central nervous system, are ""primed"" in the aged brain and are hypersensitive to messages emerging from immune-to-brain signaling pathways. Thus, in elderly individuals who have an infection, microglia overreact to signals from the peripheral immune system and produce excessive levels of cytokines, causing behavioral pathology including serious deficits in cognition. Importantly, recent studies indicate dietary flavonoids have anti-inflammatory properties and are capable of mitigating microglial cells in the brains of aged mice. Thus, dietary or supplemental flavonoids and other bioactive agents have the potential to restore the population of microglial cells in the elderly brain to its youthful state. This review briefly describes the immune-to-brain signaling pathways, consequences of microglial cell priming, and the potential of flavonoids to mitigate brain microglia and cognitive deficits induced by inflammatory cytokines.",nocancer"Do specific dietary constituents and supplements affect mental energy? Review of the evidence. The numbers of marketing claims and food, beverage, and drug products claiming to increase mental energy have risen rapidly, thus increasing the need for scientific specificity in marketing and food label claims. Mental energy is a three-dimensional construct consisting of mood (transient feelings about the presence of fatigue or energy), motivation (determination and enthusiasm), and cognition (sustained attention and vigilance). The present review focuses on four dietary constituents/supplements (Ginkgo biloba, ginseng, glucose, and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids) to illustrate the current state of the literature on dietary constituents and mental energy. The strongest evidence suggests effects of Ginkgo biloba on certain aspects of mood and on attention in healthy subjects, as well as associations between omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and reduced risk of age-related cognitive decline. Limitations of the current data and challenges for future research are discussed.",nocancer"Evaluation of an intensive desensitisation, oral tolerance therapy and hunger provocation program for children who have had prolonged periods of tube feeds. BACKGROUND: Some children with feeding difficulties may require nasogastric tube feeding or insertion of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) from a young age. A small cohort of these children can develop severe oral aversions that can delay the re-introduction of oral feeding. Multidisciplinary approaches that provide an intensive approach are deemed the most effective method of intervention to reduce nasogastric and PEG dependency. METHODS: Two children and their parents received an intensive approach to reduce PEG feeds (Child A and Child B), while one child and her parents elected to receive a traditional feeding clinic approach (Child C). The mean age of the participants was 4 years 4 months. RESULTS: Child A initially took 2090 kJ (44% daily nutritional requirement) via her PEG before the intensive program, and Child B took 100% daily nutritional requirement via his PEG. Three months post the intervention, Child A took 100% of her nutritional requirements orally and Child B had reduced PEG requirement significantly to 38% of daily nutritional requirement. Child C showed no changes in PEG versus oral intake. Children who received the intervention were able to remain focused on mealtimes for longer, with fewer instances of leaving the table. Parents altered their language styles post coaching on the intensive intervention using fewer reprimands. No changes with these behaviours were noted with Child C. CONCLUSIONS: Although this was a small pilot study, there are some strategies used within an intensive multidisciplinary context that can enable children to reduce their reliance on PEG feeds significantly.",nocancer"Impact of patient characteristics on orthopaedic and trauma patients' perceptions of individualised nursing care. RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Relatively few studies have investigated the relationship between patient characteristics and individualised care, in relation to the improvement of care efficiency, efficacy and quality. Individualised care is a key concept in health strategy and policy in Western countries. The aim of this exploratory study was to identify orthopaedic and trauma patients' characteristics relating to their perceptions of individualised nursing care in Western hospital settings. METHODS: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted among orthopaedic and trauma patients (n=1126) from acute care in hospitals from five countries: Finland, Greece, Sweden, the UK and the USA, in 2005-06. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics, one-way analysis of variance and a multivariate analysis of variance (manova) of the main effects. RESULTS: The separate examination of each background factor showed statistically significant differences between patients' perceptions of individualised care. In the multivariate analysis the statistically significant main effects, associated with patients' perceptions, were age, gender, education and type of admission. These explained 13% of the variance in the support of patient individuality in care and 19% in perceived individuality in care received. CONCLUSIONS: These results can be used in individualising care to different patient groups and in prioritising and focusing quality programs to improve care. Detailed questions about specific aspects of patients' experiences are likely to be more useful in monitoring hospital performance from the patients' perspective.",nocancer"Thickened fluids for people with dementia in residential aged care facilities. AIM: This systematic review aimed to establish best practice in relation to thickened fluids for people with dementia living in residential aged care facilities. METHODS: This review considered all types of studies that examined the prescription and administration of thickened fluids to people with dementia in residential aged care facilities. English-language articles published from 1995 to 2008 were sought in a comprehensive search of an extensive range of databases, online sources and unpublished literature. Two independent reviewers critically appraised each article using the relevant Joanna Briggs Institute System for the Unified Management, Assessment and Review of Information (JBI-SUMARI) instruments, then data were extracted from those articles that met the inclusion criteria. No meta-analysis was possible because of significant clinical and methodological heterogeneity, therefore results are reported narratively. RESULTS: From 112 papers originally identified, 14 met the inclusion criteria and formed the basis of the findings. Nine studies recommend the use of thickened fluids as a strategy to maintain adequate fluid intake for persons with dementia with dysphagia in residential aged care and four papers recommend their use for people with dementia in general. One paper reported that the use of thickened fluids was found to be acceptable to older people in the event of dementia and dysphagia. CONCLUSIONS: From the retrieved data, evidence-based best practices cannot be concluded. It can, however, be cautiously inferred that thickened fluids may be effective for residents with dementia if set guidelines are instituted.",nocancer"Oral liquid nutritional supplements for people with dementia in residential aged care facilities. AIM: This systematic review investigated the prescription, administration and effectiveness of oral liquid nutritional supplements (OLNS) for people with dementia in residential aged care facilities (RACF). METHODS: A comprehensive search of relevant databases, hand searching and cross-referencing found 15 relevant articles from a total of 2910 possible results. Articles which met the inclusion criteria were critically appraised by two independent reviewers using the relevant Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) appraisal checklist. Data were extracted using the relevant JBI extraction instruments. No data synthesis was possible due to clinical and methodological heterogeneity. RESULTS: Included studies examined a range of strategies, issues and results related to OLNS for persons with dementia in RACFs; however there appear to be significant gaps in the current body of research, particularly in relation to examinations of effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: This review was unable to produce a definitive finding regarding effectiveness. OLNS may improve the nutritional state of residents with dementia and help prevent weight loss, and there is some suggestion that it may slow the rate of cognitive decline. However, in order for OLNS to be effective, nursing and care staff need to ensure that sufficient attention is paid to the issues of prescription and administration.",nocancer"The genetics of type 2 diabetes: what have we learned from GWAS? Type 2 diabetes mellitus has been at the forefront of human diseases and phenotypes studied by new genetic analyses. Thanks to genome-wide association studies, we have made substantial progress in elucidating the genetic basis of type 2 diabetes. This review summarizes the concept, history, and recent discoveries produced by genome-wide association studies for type 2 diabetes and glycemic traits, with a focus on the key notions we have gleaned from these efforts. Genome-wide association findings have illustrated novel pathways, pointed toward fundamental biology, confirmed prior epidemiological observations, drawn attention to the role of beta-cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes, explained ~10% of disease heritability, tempered our expectations with regard to their use in clinical prediction, and provided possible targets for pharmacotherapy and pharmacogenetic clinical trials. We can apply these lessons to future investigation so as to improve our understanding of the genetic basis of type 2 diabetes.",nocancer"Cardiovascular outcomes in type 2 diabetes: the impact of preventative therapies. The world is facing an unprecedented increase in type 2 diabetes. Most disability and premature mortality experienced by people with diabetes is related to cardiovascular disease. This review summarizes recent evidence about approaches for managing cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes. While optimal blood pressure targets in people with diabetes remain uncertain, new data have demonstrated the benefits of routine blood pressure lowering in these patients, when administered without regard to initial blood pressure level. Other recent data indicate that blood pressure lowering treatment in patients with diabetes needs to be continued for ongoing benefit. The effects of intensive blood glucose lowering have been evaluated recently in a number of large trials, and individually these have failed to provide evidence of cardioprotection over a 4-5 year period. However, longer-term follow-up data suggest that there may be a delay in any such benefits becoming apparent. The benefits of statin therapy in preventing cardiovascular events in diabetic patients have been recently confirmed in a systematic overview of relevant trials; however, effects of fibrate therapy appear more limited. The role of antiplatelet agents remains unknown, as adequately powered trials of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes have not yet been completed.",nocancer"Forkhead box P3+ T cells express interleukin-17 in nasal mucosa of patients with both allergic rhinitis and polyposis. The pathogenesis of nasal polyposis remains unclear; it severely affects patients' quality of life and complicates inflammation in adjacent organs such as sinusitis and asthma. Aberrant immune regulatory function in these patients is proposed. The present study aims to examine the regulatory T cells (T(reg) ) in nasal mucosa of patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) and nasal polyposis (NP). Patients with AR or AR/NP were treated with inferior turbinectomy for their inferior turbinate hyperplasia. Surgically removed nasal mucosa was collected to examine the T(reg) by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. The results showed that more forkhead box P3 (FoxP3)(+) cells were found in AR with polyps than in those with AR alone. Further studies revealed that these FoxP3(+) T cells from AR/NP group also expressed interleukin (IL)-17. In vitro study showed that staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) induced CD4(+) FoxP3(+) T cells to become FoxP3(+) IL-17(+) cells via facilitating the expression of IL-6, that in synergy with transforming growth factor-beta, induce the expression of IL-17 in FoxP3(+) cells. We conclude that FoxP3(+) IL-17(+) T cells were localized in the nasal mucosa of patients with AR and NP. SEB may play a role in converting FoxP3(+) T(reg) to FoxP3(+) IL-17(+) T cells. The presence of IL-17(+) FoxP3(+) T cells may play a role in the remodelling of the nasal airways in certain people who develop polyps, irrespective of whether or not they are atopic.",nocancer"In-center hemodialysis six times per week versus three times per week. BACKGROUND: In this randomized clinical trial, we aimed to determine whether increasing the frequency of in-center hemodialysis would result in beneficial changes in left ventricular mass, self-reported physical health, and other intermediate outcomes among patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to undergo hemodialysis six times per week (frequent hemodialysis, 125 patients) or three times per week (conventional hemodialysis, 120 patients) for 12 months. The two coprimary composite outcomes were death or change (from baseline to 12 months) in left ventricular mass, as assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and death or change in the physical-health composite score of the RAND 36-item health survey. Secondary outcomes included cognitive performance; self-reported depression; laboratory markers of nutrition, mineral metabolism, and anemia; blood pressure; and rates of hospitalization and of interventions related to vascular access. RESULTS: Patients in the frequent-hemodialysis group averaged 5.2 sessions per week; the weekly standard Kt/V(urea) (the product of the urea clearance and the duration of the dialysis session normalized to the volume of distribution of urea) was significantly higher in the frequent-hemodialysis group than in the conventional-hemodialysis group (3.54+/-0.56 vs. 2.49+/-0.27). Frequent hemodialysis was associated with significant benefits with respect to both coprimary composite outcomes (hazard ratio for death or increase in left ventricular mass, 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46 to 0.82; hazard ratio for death or a decrease in the physical-health composite score, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.92). Patients randomly assigned to frequent hemodialysis were more likely to undergo interventions related to vascular access than were patients assigned to conventional hemodialysis (hazard ratio, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.08 to 2.73). Frequent hemodialysis was associated with improved control of hypertension and hyperphosphatemia. There were no significant effects of frequent hemodialysis on cognitive performance, self-reported depression, serum albumin concentration, or use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. CONCLUSIONS: Frequent hemodialysis, as compared with conventional hemodialysis, was associated with favorable results with respect to the composite outcomes of death or change in left ventricular mass and death or change in a physical-health composite score but prompted more frequent interventions related to vascular access.

Hydatid Cyst disease involves the heart in 0.02-2% of the cases. It can appear with symptoms very similar to coronary artery disease, cardiac valvular disease and pericarditis. We present a case of hydatid cyst that was located on the posterior tricuspid leaflet and that caused tricuspid regurgitation in 37 year old female patient who has gone through hydatid cyst excision from the bilateral lungs with median sternotomy 2 years ago. In addition to the right atrial and ventricular dilatation, second degree tricuspid regurgitation and significant pulmonary hypertension was found. The 2 x 2 cm smooth surfaced mass was resected from the posterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve and the defect was closed with suture with the aid of cardiopulmonary bypass. The patient followed with long term albendazole treatment. Cardiac echinococcosis should be kept in mind in some patients throughout their life with a history of previous hydatid cyst disease. Surgical excision without rupture is the treatment of choice for cardiac hydatid cyst, with following medical therapy in order to prevent recurrence.",nocancer"Penis ligaments: their use in ""increasing"" the size of the penis in penile augmentation procedures. Anatomical description in human cadavers and clinical results of a phalloplasty series. AIM: To present in human cadavers the anatomical basis of penis lengthening operations and reproduce this technique in a group of patients. MATERIALS OF STUDY: Penis ligaments in ten human cadavers were identified and dissected releasing the penis from its fixation to pubic arch. The same technique was applied to a group of forty patients that demanded a penis lengthening operation. RESULTS: The dissection of penis ligaments increases the distance pubic bone-tip of the penis for 3.1 +/- 0.6 cm. In patients, the increase in length 12 months post-operatively was 3.5 +/- 1.3 cm (2.3-5.1 cm) flaccid and 1.8 +/- 1.4 cm (1.4-3.2 cm) erect. There was a statistically significant difference (p < 0.005) between preoperative and postoperative status. The overall satisfaction rate was 67.5%. DISCUSSION: Cadavers study shows that this technique offers significant mobilization of the penis with a 3 cm gain, while on living tissue it has similar results. Anatomical parameters that might influence the final outcome of the operation are the length (antero-posterior dimension) of the pubic arch (corresponds to the length of the ligament), its angle with the horizontal level, the amount of the fatty tissue in the pubic area and the angle of the repositioning of the penis. CONCLUSIONS: Division of ligaments of the penis increases its apparent length. Significant anatomical parameters are the length of the pubic arch, its angle with the horizontal level, the amount of the fatty tissue in the pubic area and the angle of the repositioning of the penis.",nocancer"Therapeutic approach and prevention in recurrent acute biliary pancreatitis. OBJECTIVES: Acute biliary pancreatitis (ABP) is caused by alteration of the papillary patency. The normal transpapillar flux and the cleaning of the common biliary duct (CBD) may prevent potentially avoidable recurrent pancreatitis. METHODS: In the period September 1997/December 2008 we have treated 224 ABP (34 severe, 190 mild/moderate): 162 (72,4%) with the first attack, 62 (27.6%) with recurrent ABP (second or further attack). The patients with recurrent pancreatitis had not undergone, in the previous hospital stay elsewhere, the evaluation and, if necessary, the treatment of the papillary obstacle and/or CBD stones, sludge, etc. In our hospital all patients had undergone the treatment of ABR The treatment was completed with cholecystectomy. All the patients, after the discharge, were introduced in a follow-up program (clinical and ultrasonographic (US) control after 180 days and 1 year). RESULTS: In the follow-up of recurrent pancreatitis we have controlled 35 patients (56%-27 lost). The results of the follow-up showed, beside the absence of recurrent acute episodes, the stable normalization of laboratory cholestasis tests and US control. The same controls in 78 patients (48.1%) with a first attack of acute pancreatitis resulted normal in absence of a new acute episode. CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent ABP have been caused by persistent papillary obstacle. Therefore we confirm therapeutic validity of the instrumental control (US/MRCP) and the possible treatment of papillary or biliary lithiasic obstacle for the prevention of recurrent ABP?",nocancer"The prognostic significance of thoracic and abdominal trauma in severe trauma patients (Injury severity score > 15). The aim of the present study was to assess the prognostic significance of thoracic and abdominal trauma in severely injured patients. A retrospective analysis was performed based on data from the period from March 1 2006 to December 31 2007, taken from the Trauma Registry of the University Hospital ""SantAndrea"" in Rome. A total of 844 trauma patients were entered in a database created for this purpose, and only patients with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) > 15, (163 patients, 19.3%), were selected for the present study. These patients were divided into 2 groups: Group A (103 patients, 63.2%), consisting of patients with at least one thoracic injury, and Group B (46 patients, 28.2%) consisting of patients with concomitant thoracic and abdominal injuries. The impact of thoracic and abdominal trauma was studied by analyzing mortality and morbidity, in relation to patient age, cause and dynamics of trauma, length of hospital stay, and both ISS and New ISS (NISS). In a vast majority of cases, the cause of trauma was a road accident (126 patients, 77.3%). The mean age of patients with ISS > 15 was 45.2 +/- 19.3 years. The mean ISS and NISS were 25.7 +/- 10.5 and of 31.4 +/- 13.1 respectively. The overall morbidity and mortality rates were 18.4% (30 patients) and 28.8% (47 patients) respectively. In Group A the mortality rate was 23.3% (24 patients) and the morbidity rate was 33.9% (35 patients). In Group B mortality and morbidity rates were 369% (17 patients) and 43.5% (20 patients) respectively. It was shown that the presence of both thoracic and abdominal injuries significantly increases the risk of mortality and morbidity. In patients with predominantly thoracic injuries, NISS proved to be the more reliable score, while ISS appeared to be more accurate in evaluating patients with injuries affecting more than one region of the body.",nocancer"Myocardial infarction in prediabetic patients: role of blood pressure dyshomeostasis. Male gender and fasting sugar level at pre diabetic range are two of the recognized risk factors associated with coronary artery disease. Recently it was found that although males are at increased incidence of myocardial infarction (MI), the severity of disease is same for both genders among pre-diabetic myocardial infarction cases. In this study, we have retrospectively analyzed various biochemical and physiological parameters and cardiac markers of patients admitted for the first instance of myocardial infarction. We found an evidence of impairment in blood pressure homeostasis in female patients which could be one of the factors responsible for the equal degree of severity in myocardial infarction among females compared to males, despite lower incidence of MI in them.",nocancer"Influence of age and gender on cold pressor response in Indian population. Cold pressor test (CPT) is a simple and well documented laboratory test to evaluate the propensity for hypertension and sympathetic autonomic functions. Role of sex hormones was tested in the present study for the cold pressor response (CPR) in young adults of both sexes and in elderly population. The subjects comprised of young male (n=55), female (n=32) medical students of 17-25 years and elderly males (n=39) and females (n=25) of 50-70 years of age. The CPT was carried out in young and elderly males and females with one minute immersion of one hand in ice cold water (0-4 degrees C). Both in young males and females the absolute rise in SBP and DBP in response to Cold pressor test (CPT) was highly significant, with diastolic percent rise exceeding systolic. In comparison to young males, the females showed greater percent rise in SBP and DBP. Similarly, in elderly groups of both sexes, CPR was associated with significant absolute rise in SBP and DBP with diastolic percent rise more than systolic in males only. Both in young versus elderly males and young versus elderly females comparison yielded comparable percent rise in SBP and DBP. The SBP and DBP percent rise was again comparable between elderly males and females. The greater responsiveness to CPT in young females could be attributed to increased pain sensitivity to cold, and/or genetic and hereditary factors overwhelming the hormonal protection offered by estrogen and nitric oxide (NO).",nocancer"Impaired glucose tolerance: a pilot study in randomly selected population of Chennai. Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is considered as a prediabetic state that occupies a grey area between diabetes mellitus (DM) and normal glucose tolerance (NGT). If diabetes is detected at the stage of impaired glucose tolerance, it may be possible to halt the progression to overt diabetes. The study was conducted to assess the prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance and its relation with age, sex, body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR) and family history of diabetes mellitus in a randomly selected Chennai population of 200 subjects of both sexes as per the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Blood glucose concentration, body mass index and waist-hip ratio were measured by approved methods. All the data were statistically analyzed. Prevalence of IGT in this study population is 8.5%. BMI and family history of diabetes showed association with IGT. WHR showed association with IGT in males, but not in females. The prevalence of IGT is similar with differing age groups and sex.",nocancer"Effect of Valsalva maneuver on pulse wave velocity. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) was recorded in different arterial segments in 25 male normal healthy individuals, before, during and after Valsalva maneuver (VM). Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) showed significantly significant (P < 0.001) variation in phase II and IV of VM compared to baseline. PWV in aorta to femoral (AO-Fem) arterial segment revealed progressive increase from baseline to phase IV of VM (P < 0.001), while PWV in femoral to dorsalis pedis (Fem-DP) arterial segment showed more increase (P < 0.001) in phase II rather than phase IV from baseline with insignificant variation in aorta to radial (AO-Rad) arterial segment, demonstrate different response of arterial segments to VM.",nocancer"Multivitamin and micronutrient treatment improves semen parameters of azoospermic patients with maturation arrest. The study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of multivitamin and micronutrient supplementation in azoospermic patients with maturation arrest. A total of 35 azoospermic patients showing maturation arrest on testicular biopsy were recruited in this study. The patients were divided into two groups. Untreated group (n=11) without any treatment and treated group (n=24) who received multivitamins, micronutrients and co-enzyme Q10. The sperm concentration, motility and morphology were evaluated at monthly interval. The results showed reduction in liquefaction time and relative viscosity of the semen in the treated group. Further, in treated group there was appearance of spermatozoa (4.0 million/ml) exhibiting progressive motility (7%) and normal morphology (6%), even in the first follow up visit. The sperm count, motility and normal morphology increased significantly on subsequent visits. Within 3 months (3 visits) 2 pregnancies were reported. These observations indicate that multivitamin and micronutrient supplementation improve the qualitative and quantitative parameters of seminogram in patients with azoospermia of maturation arrest.",nocancer"Impact of different grades of body mass index on left ventricular structure and function. Overweight and obesity influences left ventricular structure and function. WHO Western Pacific Region in 2000 recommended lower cutoff for overweight (Body Mass Index-BMI > or = 23.0) and obesity (Body Mass Index-BMI > or = 25.0) in Asians. However, studies considering the new recommendations of body mass index (BMI) are lacking. The present study investigated the impact of different grades of BMI on left ventricular structure and systolic and diastolic function in middle aged Indian men. The study involved 74 men aged 31 to 60 (mean age 45.24 +/- 10.9) years who were grouped according to BMI as normal weight (18.5-22.9 kg/m2, n=19), overweight (23-24.9 kg/m2, n=17) and obese (> or =25 kg/m2, n=38). Left ventricular structure and function were evaluated by 2-D doppler echocardiography. Compared to normal and overweight, obese had significantly higher left ventricular mass (P < 0.05) and left atrial diameter (P < 0.01). Left ventricular diastolic function (atrial filling velocity-A) showed a significant decline in obese and even in overweight compared to normal (P < 0.05). Left ventricular systolic function showed no significant changes with increase in BMI. Left ventricular diastolic function decreases in all grades of BMI more than 23 kg/m2, whereas structural changes are present only in obese (BMI > or =25 kg/m2). Hence the revised BMI cut-off for Asians as recommended by WHO need to be considered for assessing cardiovascular risk and mortality among Indian men and more stringent control of body weight especially abdominal obesity is justified in the maintenance of cardiovascular health and functional capacity.",nocancer"Prediction and stratification of the future cardiovascular arrhythmic events: signal averaged electrocardiography versus ejection fraction. Cardiac arrhythmias as cause of sudden cardiac death remains an important public health problem. The availability of effective treatment in terms of the implantable defibrillator makes it critical to identify individuals at risk. An essential step in this process is the use of noninvasive techniques to screen patients and identify those at risk. The detection of ventricular late potential using the SAECG as a non-invasive technique is being explored for this purpose. The objective of the study was to stratify the future cardiovascular events including life threatening cardiac arrhythmias, in different cardiac diseases through positive and negative predictive values of SAECG and comparing with EF% another mechanical determinant. The study was conducted on 152 subjects selected from the OPD and admitted case of the New Civil Hospital and Govt. Medical College, Surat; between 25 to 75 years of age group, from August 2001 to June 2004. 80 healthy subjects free from any major acute/chronic illness were selected as a control using our own normative values for SAECG. The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS package. The results obtained were analyzed for significance by using Chi square and Independent 't' test. When we compared the cardiac arrhythmic events on 6 month follow-up study, based on SAECG and EF% separately we found that negative predictive value of SAECG was more (99.1%) than negative predictive value of EF% (93.6%). However positive predictive values for cardiac arrhythmic events of SAECG were less (28.9%) compare to EF% (42.9%). When both the parameters SAECG and EF% are considered together the negative as well as positive predictive values of these tests were quite high (100% and 50% respectively). In this study conducted on 152 patients we found that SAECG and EF% together were an accurate predictor of the cardiac arrhythmic events in terms of positive and negative predictive value while SAECG or EF% alone were not. However SAECG has got a more negative predictive value compare to EF%. In this study SAECG compared favorably or even better than EF% for risk stratification. SAECG and EF% together (and not separately) may be considered as a better investigational tool to stratify future cardiovascular arrhythmic events.",nocancer"Therapeutic potential of herbal drugs in cerebral ischemia. Stroke is one of the most important causes of mortality and morbidity in the world. Prevention and effective treatment of stroke is of the utmost importance. Cerebral ischemia causes disturbances in a variety of cellular and molecular mechanisms, including oxidative phosphorylation, membrane function, neurotransmitter release, and free radical generation. It has been years since tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) became the first medication approved by the FDA for the management of stroke, with limited success. Thrombolytic therapy is the most effective therapeutic strategy for the prevention of brain injury and reduction of mortality in patients with cerebral infarction. However, a combination of established thrombolytic therapy and effective neuronal protection therapy may have more beneficial effects for patients with cerebral infarction. Because clinical trials of pharmacological neuroprotective strategies in stroke have been disappointing, attention has turned towards approaches which include herbal drugs that can be used in limiting the neurological damage associated with stroke. Herbal drugs may be used as prophylactic treatment in patients with high risk of stroke. Herbals drugs have been described in ancient systems of medicine for the treatment of various ailments associated with stroke and have more recently been reported to be beneficial in treating stroke. However, the strength of evidence to support the use of these herbal drugs is unclear. This review focuses on putative mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of herbal drugs in patients with stroke and on the possibility of herbal drugs to increase the therapeutic time window in patients with cerebral ischemia.",nocancer"Predictors of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus positivity and adverse outcomes among hospitalized patients with a compatible syndrome. BACKGROUND: A pandemic (H1N1) influenza A virus was identified in 2009. OBJECTIVES: To investigate predictors for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection among hospitalized patients with a flu-like illness and to identify parameters suggesting a severe clinical course. METHODS: We analyzed a cohort of all patients hospitalized during a 2 month period with a flu-like syndrome who were tested for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection. Demographic, clinical and laboratory, along with outcome parameters, were recorded and compared between pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus-positive and negative hospitalized patients. RESULTS: Of the 179 examined hospitalized patients suspected of having pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection 65 (36%) were found positive. These patients tended to be younger and had significantly fewer comorbidities. In addition, they had a significantly higher frequency of fever (94%), cough (86%) and myalgia (29%). Furthermore, age 65 years and cough were independent predictors for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus positivity in a multivariate regression analysis. Notably, 14 of the 65 positive patients (21.5%) had acute respiratory insufficiency requiring treatment in the intensive care unit. These patients were neither older nor previously sicker than patients with non-severe disease, but were distinguished by augmented inflammatory markers, significant lymphopenia associated with disease severity, and overall mortality of 21.4%. CONCLUSIONS: Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus-positive hospitalized patients tend to be younger and have fewer comorbidities as compared to compatible negative patients. A significant number of relatively young and previously healthy positive patients might develop severe disease associated with a robust inflammatory reaction and significant lymphopenia.",nocancer"Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease. BACKGROUND: Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease is a benign and self-limited disease, first reported in Japan in 1972. The characteristic features of this disorder include lymphadenopathy and fever. OBJECTIVES: To summarize our experience with Kikuchi disease with regard to clinical manifestations and outcome. METHODS: The patients included in the study were those diagnosed with Kikuchi disease during the years 2005-2008 in two departments of internal medicine at Sheba Medical Center. RESULTS: We identified five patients with Kikuchi disease; four were women and the mean age was 22.6 years. All the patients had cervical lymphadenopathy; three had other sites of lymphadenopathy. Four of the patients had fever higher than 39 degrees C. Two of them had splenomegaly and three reported weight loss. Three of the five patients experienced a relapse of the disease and were treated with steroids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. The diagnosis was confirmed in all the patients by an excisional biopsy of lymph node. CONCLUSIONS: Kikuchi disease must be considered in every young patient with fever and lymphadenopathy. The disease usually has a benign course.",nocancer"Short and long-term outcome of pregnant women with preexisting dilated cardiomypathy: an NTproBNP and echocardiography-guided study. BACKGROUND: Little is known of the outcome of pregnant patients with previously diagnosed dilated cardiomyopathy. These patients are usually firmly advised against continuation of the pregnancy. OBJECTIVES: To examine the usefulness of serial echocardiographic follow-up and plasma N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide levels in the management of pregnant women with preexisting DCM. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled pregnant women with DCM either known or diagnosed in the first trimester. Clinical examination and serial echocardiography studies were performed at baseline, at 30 weeks gestation, peripartum, and 3 and 18 months postpartum. Blinded NTproBNP levels were obtained at 30 weeks, at delivery and 3 months postpartum. RESULTS: Between June 2005 and October 2006 we enrolled seven women who fulfilled the study criteria. Delivery and postpartum were complicated in 3 patients (42%): 2 with acute heart failure, which resolved conservatively, and 1 with major pulmonary embolism. The left ventricular ejection fraction was stable throughout the pregnancy (35% +/- 2.8 at baseline, 33% +/- 2.9 at 30 weeks) and postpartum (35% +/- 2.8 at 1 day, 34% +/- 3.1 at 90 days). Similar stable behavior was observed regarding left ventricular dimensions: LV end-systolic diameters 43.3 +/- 2.7 mm and LV end-diastolic diameters 57.3 +/- 3.3 mm at baseline compared with 44.1 +/- 3.1 mm and 58.7 +/- 3.1 mm postpartum, respectively. The NTproBNP levels rose significantly peripartum in all three patients with complications. CONCLUSIONS: Serial NTproBNP levels, as compared to echocardiography, may be a better clinical tool in monitoring and management of pregnant women with preexisting DCM. An early rise in NTproBNP level appears to predict the occurrence of adverse events.",nocancer"Achilles tendon rupture and our experience with the Achillon device. BACKGROUND: Open repair of the Achilles tendon is still the gold standard for treating rupture. This technique has the disadvantages of a long and problematic operative scar and thickly scarred Achilles tendon. To improve the surgical outcome minimally invasive techniques have been developed. OBJECTIVES: To analyze our results of Achilles tendon repair using the Achillon device and compare them with published studies. METHODS: We performed surgical repair of the Achilles tendon in 28 patients during a 4 year period (2004-2008): 14 patients were treated with the Achillon device, 12 with the open suture technique and 2 with the percutaneous method. Fourteen patients were available for follow-up: 9 patients with the Achillon device, 3 patients with open suturing and 2 patients with the percutaneous technique. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 4 years. RESULTS: The average score of the AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot Scale for the group treated with the Achillon device was 95.6 points (range 84-100) and for the group treated with the open method, 90 points (range 84-98). The length of the scar in patients operated with a minimally invasive technique was 3.81 cm (range 1-6 cm) as compared to 9.16 cm (range 8-10.5 cm) with the open suture. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first review on this procedure in Israel. Excellent functional results were achieved with this technique. Our outcomes were similar to those of two other studies.",nocancer"The effect of parity and gravidity on the outcome of medical termination of pregnancy. BACKGROUND: Previous pregnancies may influence the success of medical termination of pregnancy. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of parity and gravidity on the successful termination of pregnancy using mifepristone and misoprostol. METHODS: The medical files of all patients attending a department of obstetrics and gynecology during the years 2006 and 2007 for the purpose of medical termination of pregnancy at < or = 49 days of gestation were analyze retrospectively. The medical history, previous pregnancies and deliveries were recorded. Mifepristone was administered orally followed by 400 mg of misoprostol 48 hours later. A second dose of misoprostol was offered 2 weeks later if uterine content thickness was more than 15 mm. Then, after 24 hours, if uterine content thickness was more than 15 mm the uterus was evacuated by dilation and curettage. RESULTS: Of 403 women, 349 (86.6%) aborted following the basic regime; 207 (51.4%) (group A) were primiparous while 196 (48.6%) (group B) had at least one prior pregnancy. Uterine curettage was performed in 17 patients (8.2%) in group A and in 37 (18.9%) in group B (P = 0.002). When patients with a history of a previous abortion were excluded from group B, 32 of 143 (22.4%) required curettage (P < 0.001). When patients without a history of previous cesarean section were excluded, 10 of 52 (19.2%) underwent curettage (P = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS: Previous pregnancies negatively affect the success of medical termination of pregnancy, especially in women with a previous term pregnancy. This information is important when counseling women about the method of pregnancy termination.",nocancer"Validity of self-reported weight and height among 13-14 year old schoolchildren in Israel. BACKGROUND: Data regarding the validity of self-reported weight and height in adolescents are conflicting. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the validity of self-reported weight and height among 13-14 year olslddren. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 517 schoolchildren aged 13-14 years and compared self-reported and measured weight and height by gender, population group, parental education and crowdedness. RESULTS: Females under-reported their weight on average by 0.79 +/- 5.46 kg (P = 0.03), resulting in underestimation of the body mass index with borderline significance (mean difference 0.28 +/- 2.26 kg/m2, P = 0.06). Males over-reported their height on average by 0.75 +/- 5.81 cm (P = 0.03). Children from less crowded homes (< or = 1 person per room) overestimated their height more than children from more crowded homes, resulting in a significant underestimation of BMI (mean difference between reported BMI and measured values was 0.30 +/- 2.36 kg/m2, P = 0.04). Measured BMI was a significant predictor of the difference between self-reported and measured BMI, adjusted for gender, population group, parents' education, and crowdedness (beta = -0.3, P < 0.0001). As a result of this reporting bias, only 54.9% of children with overweight and obesity (BMI > or = 85th percentile) were classified correctly, while 6.3% of children were wrongly classified as overweight and obese. The largest difference in BMI was observed in obese females (4.40 +/- 4.34) followed by overweight females (218 +/- 1.95) and underweight females (-1.38 +/- 13.75). Similar findings were observed for males, where the largest difference was found among obese males (2.83 +/- 3.44). CONCLUSIONS: Studies based on self-reported weight and height in adolescents may be biased. Attempts should be made to correct this bias, based on the available data for each population.",nocancer"Child abuse and neglect: reporting by health professionals and their need for training. BACKGROUND: For health professionals who interact professionally with children, adequate awareness and training regarding the clinical indicators of child abuse and neglect, as well as subsequent reporting and procedures, are essential. OBJECTIVES: To study Israeli health professionals experiences with identification and reporting of suspected cases of child abuse and neglect, and their perceived training needs in this area. METHODS: The study group was a convenience sample comprising 95 Israeli health professionals (physicians, nurses, social workers, psychologists, etc.) attending workshops on medical aspects at a national conference on child abuse and neglect. In this cross-sectional survey, the health professionals were asked to complete an anonymous structured questionnaire on their experience with child abuse and neglect and on their training needs. RESULTS: The participants in the survey had relatively high levels of involvement with child protection. Nevertheless, they strongly expressed their need for training, especially in mastering practice skills. The need for training was greater for professionals with less experience in child protection, and there were different needs according to profession. CONCLUSIONS: Despite their prior extensive experience in dealing with child abuse and neglect, most of the health professionals participating in the conference reported the need for training in certain areas.",nocancer"Transradial percutaneous coronary intervention without on-site cardiac surgery for stable coronary disease and myocardial infarction: preliminary report and initial experience in 174 patients. BACKGROUND: On-site cardiac surgery is not widely available in developing countries despite a high prevalence of coronary artery disease. OBJECTIVES: To analyze the safety, feasibility and cost-effectiveness of transradial percutaneous coronary intervention without on-site cardiac surgery in a community hospital in a developing country. METHODS: Of the 174 patients who underwent PCI for the first time in our center, we analyzed two groups: stable coronary disease and acute myocardial infarction. The primary endpoint was the rate of complications during the first 24 hours after PCI. We also analyzed the length of hospital stay and the rate of hospital readmission in the first week after PCI, and compared costs between the radial and femoral approaches. RESULTS: The study group comprised 131 patients with stable coronary disease and 43 with acute MI. Among the patients with stable coronary disease 8 (6.1%) had pulse loss, 12 (9.16%) had on-site hematoma, and 3 (2.29%) had bleeding at the site of the puncture. Among the patients with acute MI, 3 (6.98) had pulse loss and 5 (11.63%) had bleeding at the site of the puncture. There were no cases of atriovenous fistula or nerve damage. In the stable coronary disease group, 130 patients (99%) were discharged on the same day (2.4 +/- 2 hours). In the acute MI group, the length of stay was 6.6 +/- 2.5 days with at least 24 hours in the intensive care unit. There were no hospital readmissions in the first week after the procedure. The total cost, which includes equipment related to the specific approach and recovery room stay, was significantly lower with the radial approach compared to the femoral approach (US$ 500 saving per intervention). CONCLUSIONS: The transradial approach was safe and feasible in a community hospital in a developing country without on-site cardiac surgery backup. The radial artery approach is clearly more cost-effective than the femoral approach.",nocancer"Security and psychiatry: the British experience and implications for forensic psychiatry services in Israel. The courts have recently become increasingly involved in the administration of compulsory psychiatric services in Israel. Data reveal a gradual increase in the rate of court-ordered hospitalizations according to Section 15 of the Law for the Treatment of the Mentally Ill. This paper examines the implications of this trend, particularly the issues of security and safety in psychiatric hospitalization. We present highlights from extensive British experience, focusing on the implications on forensic psychiatry in Israel. We review the development of the hierarchy of security in the British psychiatric services, beginning in the early 1970s with the establishment of the Butler Committee that determined a hierarchy of three levels of security for the treatment of patients, culminating with the establishment of principles for the operation of medium security units in Britain (Read Committee, 1991). These developments were the basis for the forensic psychiatric services in Britain. We discuss the relevance of the British experience to the situation in Israel while examining the current status of mental health facilities in Israel. In our opinion, a safe and suitable environment is a necessary condition for a treatment setting. The establishment of medium security units or forensic psychiatry departments within a mental health facility will enable the concentration and classification of court-ordered admissions and will enable systemic flexibility and capacity for better treatment, commensurate with patient needs.",nocancer"Inhale, exhale, e-mail: tips for effectively handling e-mail.

The Patient Protection and Accountable Care Act (PPACA), signed into law by President Obama on March 23, 2010, contains provisions designed to materially change the manner in which hospitals and physicians deliver care to Medicare and Medicaid patients and the way they are compensated for such care. The purpose is to vastly improve the quality of healthcare, while at the same time lowering healthcare costs. This quality/cost initiative is a concept that will spell the future for healthcare reform.

A 4-year-old fully immunised male presented to a regional hospital in the West Kimberley with fever and lethargy. Blood cultures yielded serogroup B Neisseria meningitidis, resistant to benzylpenicillin (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 1.0 mg/L). The patient was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and made a complete recovery. Although invasive N. meningitidis isolates with reduced penicillin susceptibility are not uncommon in Australia, this is the first report of a benzylpenicillin-resistant isolate (MIC > 0.5 mg/L) causing invasive disease. As benzylpenicillin is currently recommended as first line empiric and definitive therapy for invasive meningococcal disease, the emergence of penicillin-resistant N. meningitidis disease is of concern and emphasises the importance of ongoing surveillance for antimicrobial resistance.",nocancer"Zoonotic tuberculosis: on the decline.

Public health measures have been targeting potential exposure to Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) since the first recognised human cases, more than a decade ago. The effect of these measures on the epidemiology of notifications of potential exposure has not been investigated since 2003. Trends in notifications of potential exposure to ABLV reported to the Brisbane Southside Public Health Unit between November 1996 and October 2008 were examined. During the study period notification rates declined among all population groups and potential exposures were notified more promptly. The proportion of female notifications and the proportion of notifications from volunteer bat carers and their families and professional groups decreased over time. These changes over 12 years may indicate success of public health measures, under-reporting of potential exposure or both. Intentional handling of bats by untrained members of the public continues to be an important source of potential exposure to ABLV and requires a sustained public health response.",nocancer"An outbreak of gastroenteritis due to Salmonella Typhimurium phage type 170 associated with consumption of a dessert containing raw egg. Eggs are frequently implicated as a source of foodborne salmonellosis. In February 2009 an investigation was commenced following reports of gastrointestinal illness among diners at a Canberra restaurant. The investigation sought to confirm the existence of an outbreak, identify a source and implement public health measures to prevent more cases. Menus and booking lists were obtained from the restaurant and a case-control study was commenced. A suspected case was defined as a person who ate at the restaurant on 13 or 14 February 2009 and subsequently developed diarrhoea and/or vomiting. Twenty cases and 31 controls were enrolled in the study. Eating a tiramisu dessert containing raw egg had a highly statistically significant association with illness (crude odds ratio 130.50, 95% confidence interval 13.54-1605.28). Among the 20 cases, nine of 12 stool samples were positive for Salmonella Typhimurium phage type 170 (STm 170). No microbiological evidence of STm 170 was obtained from the restaurant or during the egg trace-back investigation.

The Australian Collaboration for Chlamydia Enhanced Sentinel Surveillance (ACCESS) was established with funding from the Department of Health and Ageing to trial the monitoring of the uptake and outcome of chlamydia testing in Australia. ACCESS involved 6 separate networks; 5 clinical networks involving sexual health services, family planning clinics, general practices, antenatal clinics, Aboriginal community controlled health services, and 1 laboratory network. The program ran from May 2007 to September 2010. An evaluation of ACCESS was undertaken in early 2010, 2 years after the program was funded. At the time of the evaluation, 76 of the 91 participating sites were contributing data. The jurisdictional distribution of the 76 sites generally matched the jurisdictional distribution of the Australian population. In 2008, the chlamydia testing rates in persons aged 16-29 years attending the 26 general practices was 4.2% in males and 7.0% in females. At the 25 sexual health services, the chlamydia testing rates in heterosexuals aged less than 25 years in 2008 was 77% in males and 74% in females. Between 2004 and 2008, the chlamydia positivity rate increased significantly in heterosexual females aged less than 25 years attending the sexual health services, from 11.5% to 14.1% (P < 0.01). Data completeness was above 85% for all core variables except Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander status and country of birth, which ranged from 68%-100%, and 74%-100%, respectively, per network. There were delays in establishment of the system due to recruitment of 91 sites, multiple ethics applications and establishment of automated extraction programs in 10 different database systems, to transform clinic records into a common, pre-defined surveillance format.

A pilot study was conducted in rural northern New South Wales from 15 July to 28 August 2009, during Australia's Protect Phase response to the Influenza A H1N1 California 7/09 pandemic. This study explored the feasibility of using administrative data, generated from the distribution of stockpiled antivirals, as a syndromic surveillance system. The purpose was to identify recently affected towns or those with increasing influenza-like illness activity to assist in rural health service operational planning. Analysis of antiviral distribution data was restricted to 113 general practices in rural parts of the Hunter New England Area Health Service. By 2 September 2009 a total of 6,670 courses of antivirals for adults, of which 455 courses were replacement orders, had been distributed to these general practices. Distribution of replacement antivirals were mapped to local government areas on a weekly basis. The syndromic surveillance system delivered timely data on antiviral distribution; used readily available software to generate visual activity maps in less than 30 minutes; proved adaptable; was of low cost; and was well received by health service planners. Full evaluation of the system's utility was limited by the relatively large initial distribution of antivirals and the brief nature of Australia's first pandemic wave. The pilot study demonstrated that a syndromic surveillance system based on distribution of supplies, such as treatment or vaccines, can support local health service operational planning during health emergencies.",nocancer"Annual report of the Australian Meningococcal Surveillance Programme, 2009. In 2009 there were 233 laboratory-confirmed cases of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) analysed by the National Neisseria Network, Australia, a nationwide network of reference laboratories. One hundred and thirty-five isolates of Neisseria meningitidis from invasive cases of meningococcal disease were available for which the phenotypes (serogroup, serotype and serosub-type) and/or genotype and antibiotic susceptibility were determined. An additional 98 cases were confirmed by non-culture-based methods (92 by nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) and six by serology) , and where possible serotyping was determined. Nationally, 194 (83%) laboratory-confirmed cases where a serogroup was determined were infected with serogroup B and 13 (5.6%) serogroup C meningococci. The national total of confirmed cases has remained relatively stable since 2006, but the number of cases may vary between jurisdictions each year. New South Wales had the highest number of recorded cases in 2009. Typical primary and secondary disease peaks were observed in those aged 4 years or less and in adolescents and young adults respectively. Serogroup B cases predominated in all age groups and jurisdictions. The common phenotypes circulating in Australia continue to be B:15:P1.7 and B:4:P1.4. Although serogroup C cases were low, phenotype C:2a:P1.5 again predominated in this group. No evidence of meningococcal capsular 'switching' was detected. Approximately two-thirds of all isolates showed decreased susceptibility to the penicillin group of antibiotics (MIC 0.06 to 0.5 mg/L). All isolates remained susceptible to ceftriaxone. Four isolates had reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, and none to rifampicin.",nocancer"Annual report of the Australian National Poliovirus Reference Laboratory, 2009. The Australian National Poliovirus Reference Laboratory (NPRL) is accredited by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the testing of faecal specimens from acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases and operates as a regional poliovirus reference laboratory for the Western Pacific Region. The NPRL, in collaboration with the Australian Paediatric Surveillance Unit, co-ordinates surveillance for cases of AFP in children in Australia, according to criteria recommended by the WHO. Specimens are referred from AFP cases in children and suspected cases of poliomyelitis in persons of any age. The WHO AFP surveillance performance indicator is 1 non-polio AFP case per 100,000 children less than 15 years of age. In 2009, the Polio Expert Committee classified 48 cases as non-polio AFP, a rate of 1.17 cases per 100,000 children less than 15 years of age. An additional WHO AFP surveillance performance indicator is that more than 80% of notified AFP cases have 2 faecal samples collected 24 hours apart and within 14 days of onset of paralysis. Adequate faecal samples were received from 16 (33.3%) of the 48 classified cases. A poliovirus was referred via the Enterovirus Reference Laboratory Network of Australia from a non-AFP case and was determined to be Sabin-like. This case most likely represents an importation event, the source of which was not identified, as Australia ceased using Sabin oral polio vaccine in 2005. The last report of a wild poliovirus importation in Australia was from Pakistan in 2007.

This report summarises Australian passive surveillance data for adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) reported to the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) for 2009, and describes reporting trends over the 10-year period 2000 to 2009. There were 2,396 AEFI records for vaccines administered in 2009, the highest number reported, a 46% increase over the 1,638 in 2008. The increase was almost entirely due to reports related to the introduction of pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) 2009 influenza vaccine from September 2009 (n = 1,312) largely from the members of the public. The pH1N1 AEFI reporting rate for people aged > or = 18 years was 34.2 per 100,000 administered doses compared with 2.8 for seasonal influenza vaccine. The rates in > or = 65 year-olds were 28.0, 1.6 and 13.3 for pH1N1, seasonal influenza and polysaccharide pneumococcal, respectively. The high reporting rate for pH1N1 vaccine is likely to be at least partly due to enhanced reporting seen for all new vaccines and greater levels of reporting from members of the public in response to the implementation of strategies to encourage reporting, as part of the pH1N1 program. For children < 7 years, AEFI reporting rates in 2009 (14.1 per 100,000 administered doses) were similar to previous years. There were 193 (8%) AEFI reports classified as serious; 6 deaths temporally associated with immunisation were reported but none were judged to have a causal association. As in previous years, the most commonly reported reactions were allergic reaction, injection site reaction, fever, headache, malaise, nausea and myalgia. The most commonly reported reactions following pH1N1 influenza vaccine were allergic reaction (n = 381), headache (n = 289), fever (n = 235), pain (n = 186), nausea (n = 180) and injection site reaction (n = 178). The data within the limitation of passive surveillance provide a reference point for ongoing reporting of trends in AEFI by age group, severity and vaccine type and illustrate the value of the national TGA database as a surveillance tool for monitoring AEFI nationally.",nocancer"Immunisation coverage annual report, 2008. This, the 2nd annual immunisation coverage report, documents trends during 2008 for a range of standard measures derived from Australian Childhood Immunisation Register data, including overall coverage at standard age milestones and for individual vaccines included on the National Immunisation Program (NIP). Coverage by indigenous status and mapping by smaller geographic areas as well as trends in timeliness are also summarised according to standard templates. With respect to overall coverage, Immunise Australia Program targets have been reached for children at 12 and 24 months of age but not for children at 5 years of age. Coverage at 24 months of age exceeds that at 12 months of age, but as receipt of varicella vaccine at 18 months is excluded from calculations of 'fully immunised' this probably represents delayed immunisation, with some contribution from immunisation incentives. Similarly, the decrease in coverage estimates for immunisations due at 4 years of age from March 2008, is primarily due to changing the assessment age from 6 years to 5 years of age from December 2007. A number of individual vaccines on the NIP are not currently assessed for 'fully immunised' status or for eligibility for incentive payments. These include pneumococcal conjugate and meningococcal C conjugate vaccines for which coverage is comparable to vaccines which are assessed for 'fully immunised' status, and rotavirus and varicella vaccines for which coverage is lower. Coverage is also suboptimal for vaccines recommended for Indigenous children only (i.e. hepatitis A and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine) as previously reported for other vaccines for both children and adults. Delayed receipt of vaccines is an important issue for vaccines recommended for Indigenous children and has not improved among non-Indigenous children despite improvements in coverage at the 24-month milestone. Although Indigenous children in Australia have coverage levels that are similar to non-indigenous children at 24 months of age, the disparity in delayed vaccination between Indigenous and non-indigenous children, which is up to 18% for the 3rd dose of DTP, remains a challenge.",nocancer"Arboviral diseases and malaria in Australia, 2008-09: annual report of the National Arbovirus and Malaria Advisory Committee. The National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System received 8,677 notifications of diseases transmitted by mosquitoes in Australia from 1 July 2008 to 30 June 2009. The alphaviruses, Barmah Forest and Ross River, accounted for 6,574 (78%) of these notifications during 2008-09. There were 1,009 notifications of dengue virus infection locally-acquired in North Queensland and 484 notified cases resulted from overseas travel. Notification rates of dengue virus infection for 2008-09, regardless of where infection was acquired, exceeded the five-year mean rate and may be attributed to increased disease activity in the Asia-Pacific region. North Queensland was the site of several outbreaks of locally-acquired dengue virus infection involving all 4 serotypes. These dengue outbreaks affected several locations with over 1,000 notifications. Detection of flavivirus seroconversions in sentinel chicken flocks across Australia provides an early warning of increased levels of Murray Valley encephalitis virus and Kunjin virus activity. Increased levels of flavivirus activity were detected in western and northern Australia, which prompted public health action. This action preceded 4 notifications of Murray Valley encephalitis infections, 2 (fatal) cases acquired in the Northern Territory and two in Western Australia.

The objective of this study was to explore demographic and economic characteristics associated with household food security of 2,784 low-income households with pre-school aged children receiving food supplements from the Colombian Plan for Improving Food and Nutrition in Antioquia - MANA (Mejoramiento Alimentario y Nutricional de Antioquia) in the Department of Antioquia, Colombia. Included in the study was a 12-item household food security survey was collected from a cross-sectional, stratified random sample of MANA participants in which households were characterized as food secure, mildly food insecure, moderately food insecure, and severely food insecure. It was hypothesized that household food security status would be strongly associated with demographic characteristics, food expenditure variables, and food supplement consumption by children in MANA. Food insecure households were characterized by more members, older parents, and lower income (p < 0.0001). Rural residence and female head of households had higher rates of food insecurity (p < 0.01). Food insecure households had the lowest monthly expenditures food (p < 0.0001). Severely food insecure households saved the highest percentage of per capita food expenditure from consuming MANA supplements (p < 0.0001), similarly, MANA food supplement intakes were greatest in households reporting the most food insecurity (p < 0.001). The results of this study are important to describe characteristics of the population benefiting from the MANA nutrition intervention by their unique level of household food security status.",nocancer"Risk factors associated with hemoglobin levels and nutritional status among Brazilian children attending daycare centers in Sao Paulo City, Brazil. Like many other developing countries, Brazil has been going a nutritional transition which presence both malnutrition and overweight. Stunting and overweight are the major public health problems in Brazilian children. The objective of this study was to document the prevalence of stunting, overweight and anemia in preschool children and examine if those nutritional problems are related; also identify if these nutritional problems have the same risk factors. Data from the ""Efficient Daycare Center Project"" which include 270 children attending nurseries of eight daycare centers in Sao Paulo city, Brazil were used for this study. Data on height and weight were converted to z-scores using WHO anthro software. Hemoglobin (Hb) concentrations were determined on finger-prick blood samples. The co-occurrence of stunting, overweight and anemia was investigated by contingency tables a log-linear model. Univariate and multiple regression analyses were performed to estimate the association of HAZ, WAZ, WHZ and Hb levels with their risk factors. The results showed high prevalence of overweight (22.2%), risk of stunting (22.6%) and anemia (37%). Percent of daycare attendance, age, number of siblings under 5 years old and per capita income are associated with Hb levels. This study provides evidence that Brazil is going through a nutritional transition and suggest that the adoption of public policies to expand and improve services in daycare centers may help to prevent multi-nutritional problems in preschool children.",nocancer"Induction of new ADAM related proteins from treated human Chang-liver cells. Chang-liver cells is a cell line generated from human liver tissue, which is often used in scientific research. ADAMs are a family of proteins that consist of multi-domains, possess multi-functions and play a central role in normal or abnormal physiological conditions, such as regeneration and tumorigenesis. To investigate the expression and functional alteration of the ADAMs or ADAM related proteins in Chang-liver cells, this cell line was treated with heat stress, modified Hanks solution containing ATP or other buffers. Our results showed that the treatment with Hanks solution containing ATP induces Chang-liver cells to express new ADAM related proteins. To analyze these new ADAM related proteins, a cDNA expression library was constructed for the treated Chang-liver cells. A series of positive clones were obtained through immunoscreening with an ADAMs common antibody. A new ADAM related protein possessing alkaline protease activity was confirmed in these clones.",nocancer"Medicare and Medicaid programs: changes to the hospital and critical access hospital conditions of participation to ensure visitation rights for all patients.

(Cardio-circulatory care)]. Mortality in pediatric cardiovascular failure is markedly improved with the advent of neonatal and pediatric intensive care and with the implementation of treatment guidelines. In 2002 the American College of Critical Care Medicine Clinical Practice Parameters for Hemodynamic Support of Pediatric and Neonatal Shock reported mortality rates of 0%-5% in previously healthy and 10% in chronically ill children with septic shock associated with implementation of ""best clinical practices"". Early recognition of shock is the key to successful resuscitation in critically ill children. Often, shock results in or co-exists with myo-cardial dysfunction or acute lung injury. Recognition and appropriate management of these insults is crucial for successful outcomes. Resuscitation should be directed to restoration of tissue perfusion and normalization of cardiac and respiratory function. The underlying cause of shock should also be addressed urgently. The physiological response of individual children to shock resuscitation varies and is often unpredictable. Therefore, repeated assessments of vital parameters are needed for taking appropriate decisions. Global indices of tissue oxygen delivery help in targeting therapies more accurately. Isotonic fluids form the cornerstone of treatment and the amount required for resuscitation is based on etiologies and therapeutic response. After resuscitation has been initiated, targeted history and clinical evaluation must be performed to ascertain the cause of shock and management of co-morbidities should be implemented simultaneously. While the management of shock can be protocol based, the treatment needs to be individualized depending on the suspected etiology and therapeutic response particularly for children who suffer from congenital heart disease.",nocancer
